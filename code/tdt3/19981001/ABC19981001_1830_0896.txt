There is new evidence today about the dangers of secondhand smoke 
for pregnant women and their babies. Exposure to smoke doubles the 
risk of a woman giving birth to a smaller baby. Those babies are at 
much greater risk themselves of birth defects. Researchers say second-hand 
smoke is as dangerous to the baby as when the pregnant woman smokes 
herself.
