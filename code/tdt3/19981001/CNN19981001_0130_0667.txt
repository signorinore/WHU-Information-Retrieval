Many Boston restaurants are now smoke-free. Under new city regulations 
1,400 of Boston's eateries must seat smokers and non-smokers in partitioned 
areas. Since many restaurants are too small to make that accommodation 
smokers will have to light up outside. The laws don't apply to bars 
or private clubs.
