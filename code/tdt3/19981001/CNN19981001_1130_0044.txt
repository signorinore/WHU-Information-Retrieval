The trial of former agriculture secretary Mike Espy is under way in 
the nations' capitol. Espy is accused of accepting $35,000 worth of 
gifts from businesses regulated by his agency. He resigned in 1994 
after an independent counsel began an investigation. Espy's trial 
is expected to last at least six weeks.
