General Motors is taking another step in its effort to lure customers 
back after strikes shut down most of its plants this summer. G.M. 
says it will install a safety and security system on many of its trucks 
and cars for free. The system is worth about $1,300. G.M. saw its 
market share shrink from 31% in June to less than 21% in July as the 
strike was taking place.
