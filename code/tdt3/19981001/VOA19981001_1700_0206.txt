A senior Iraqi official has denied reports in the United States that 
Iraq is moving closer to making nuclear weapons. He was responding 
to a "Washington Post" report which said Iraq has three or four trigger 
devices needed to set off a nuclear blast and lacks only plutonium 
or enriched uranium to make the bombs.
