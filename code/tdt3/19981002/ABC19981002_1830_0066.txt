Good evening. We begin tonight with a sign of real weakness in the 
U.S. job market. For so many months, businesses have done almost anything 
to find workers. And all that while the Asian economic crisis was 
sneaking up on the U.S. today the effects are tangible. The unemployment 
rate has risen 0.1%, to 4.6%. job growth in general last month was 
the weakest it's been in nearly three years. First, here's ABC's Betsy 
Stark. Today's jobs report carries two distinct messages -- the American 
economy remains solid, but there's no question it's slowing down. 
The number of people in manufacturing jobs fell for the fifth time 
in six months. There are fewer jobs in construction, as well. We've 
gone from an economy that was essentially perfect to an economy today 
that is still, on balance, good, but nowhere near as strong as it 
was 12 months ago. Across the country, from Wall Street brokerages 
to high-flying technology firms, businesses that couldn't hire fast 
enough a few months ago have now stopped hiring, or even cut back. 
In Atlanta, where regional unemployment is still a staggeringly low 
2%, scientific-Atlanta has laid off more than 100 workers. While sales 
of its television equipment in the United States remain strong, overseas 
sales have plummeted. We saw a 54% reduction year to year in our international 
business. The Asian crisis has claimed another victim today -- Hewlett-Packard 
said falling profits are forcing the computermaker to cut 2,500 jobs. 
Companies that make computer chip have already slashed their workforces 
30%. Economists say, don't expect the picture to improve any time 
soon. Slowdowns in growth mean slowdowns in hiring. And this slowdown 
is just beginning. Betsy Stark, ABC News, New York.
