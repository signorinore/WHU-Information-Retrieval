In Berlin today, one of the world's most famous places has been rededicated 
after more than 50 years. In the 1920s and '30s, the potsdamer platz 
was Europe's center of arts and culture. After world war II, the Berlin 
wall ran right through it. Today it's once again filled with theaters 
and shops. "50 years couldn't kill this place," said someone today. 
"Life will is back here".
