California. ABC's Brian Rooney is there tonight. Riding the range 
once more When men in big hats ruled the screen, Gene autry rode out

working in a railroad telegraph office, he went on to make 94 features.

red-nosed reindeer. Gene autry was the hero of children, a friend 
of presidents and a smart businessman. After two years as a pilot,
