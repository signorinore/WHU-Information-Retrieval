When we come back, Van gogh in America. this is not a country for 
wimps. We invented the cowboy, wbaker, and the quarterback blitz... 
we are!!rough on our cars. So get a Chevy Malibu. It'll go up to 100,000 
miles before its first scheduled tune-up. Transmission fluid: 100,000 
miles engine coolant: 5 years or 150,000 miles... we're talking tough! 
The car you knew America could build. The Chevy Malibu. Kids today 
need to learn patience. My son knows when he does the dishes he has 
to take his time. First the pots and pans have to be set aside, then 
soaked and scrubbed and carefully loaded in the dishwasher. Introducing 
new cascade plus-- packed with amazing power pretreaters... that blast 
away tough food problems you thought your diswasher couldn't handle. 
Here other detergents fail, new cascade plus leaves incredible results. 
Perfect. New cascade plus-- mornings seem so much brighter... after 
a good night's sleep. That's why I love my Tylenol P.M. sometimes 
I have trouble sleeping. I used to worry about taking something. How 
would I feel in the morning? And then I tried Tylenol P.M. it stops 
my pain and helps me sleep. So in the morning, I'm rested, refreshed, 
ready to make the most of my day. It's Tylenol P.M.
