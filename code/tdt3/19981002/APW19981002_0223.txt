Hong Kong and Austria signed an air services agreement Friday, the 
government reported. A statement said the agreement was signed by 
Hong Kong's secretary for economic services, Stephen Ip, and Austria's 
state secretary for foreign affairs, Benita Ferrero-Waldner. At present, 
Austria's Lauda Air operates two flights a week between Hong Kong 
and Vienna. The new air pact provides for the continued development 
of air services between the two sides following Hong Kong's reversion 
to Chinese rule last year. Hong Kong has signed such air services 
agreements with 31 countries so far.
