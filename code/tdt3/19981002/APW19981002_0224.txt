Intent on forming a new German government, Chancellor-elect Gerhard 
Schroeder and his party, the Social Democrats, opened formal negotiations 
with the environmentalists Greens on Friday. Schroeder invited the 
Greens to be his junior coalition partner after he defeated Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl in elections Sunday and returned the left to power after 
16 years. ``We're going to have a nice start today,'' Schroeder said 
heading into the talks at the North Rhine-Westphalia state offices 
overlooking the Rhine River. The first round of talks were expected 
to focus on how the new government would finance its priorities, fighting 
unemployment and restoring social welfare benefits trimmed by Kohl's 
government. The Greens' budget expert, Oswald Metzger, has recommend 
raising the tax on gasoline by 26 pfennigs (15 cents) a liter, the 
mass-circulation Bild newspaper reported Friday. The party also wants 
to delay tax reform until 2000 and do away with an annual 13th month 
payment to retired government workers, the newspaper said. At the 
same time, Metzger warned that economic growth was leveling off and 
called for government spending cuts. The 12-member Greens delegation 
declined to comment going into the meeting. A small group of protesters 
gathered near the meeting sight urged the Greens to ``stop nuclear 
energy now.''
