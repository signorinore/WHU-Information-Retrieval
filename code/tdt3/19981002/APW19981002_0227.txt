The influential wife of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic Friday 
criticized the United States, comparing it to a ``bellicose giant 
that picks adversaries who cannot defend themselves.'' Apparently 
angered by the U.S. pressure on her husband over Kosovo and possibility 
of NATO attacks, Mirjana Markovic, in a text published in the newspaper 
Politika, accused Washington of taking the leading role in turning 
the world against Serbia. Markovic is believed to have considerable 
influence on Milosevic and the Yugoslav leader's policies. But Markovic 
enjoys little popularity among the public in Yugoslavia, made of Serbia 
and Montenegro. ``It has been almost a decade since the Security Council 
started bringing resolutions accusing the Serbs for wars and violence 
in the Balkans,'' Markovic wrote. ``It has been almost a decade since 
the United States have stood behind the policies of the United Nations.'' 
In her text, apparently meant to be slightly ironic, Markovic said 
the United States does not dare clash with ``a big and strong state, 
a nation that can fight back, an appropriate adversary.'' Instead, 
Markovic said, the Americans ``declare small and impoverished states 
their enemies, bomb them occasionally and impose sanctions to protect 
U.S. national interests!'' Markovic said the biggest ``cynicism'' 
of the 20th century has been U.S. cruise missile attack on a chemical 
plant in Sudan, ``a half-hungry African state in which children die 
of hunger in 1998 as they did at the beginning of the century.'' ``How 
come that this civilization giant of our times does not get angry 
and dare clash with someone equal to it?'' she asked. ``Which is the 
real role of the giant that can get angry and destroy only the adversary 
that could fit into his hand?''
