Despite its decision to scrap 40 Soviet-era strategic bombers, Ukraine 
still hopes to sell some parts of the planes to Russia, a news report 
said Friday. The Russian government is studying the proposals to purchase 
certain units and components from the Tu-95 MC and Tu-160 warplanes 
``very carefully,'' Defense Minister Oleksandr Kuzmuk said, according 
to the Interfax news agency. Ukraine inherited 19 Tu-160s and 25 Tu-95 
MCs after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. The long-range planes, 
designed to carry guided missiles with nuclear warheads, are based 
at two airfields in the Kiev and Chernihiv regions. Ukraine and Russia 
have negotiated for years over the possible sale of the planes, most 
of which have since deteriorated. Last spring, the Kremlin said it 
had made a final decision not to purchase the planes, which cost Ukraine 
about dlrs 1.3 million a year to maintain. Ukraine's Security Council 
decided in April to liquidate 40 bombers, turn two of them into museum 
pieces and convert two others for other, unspecified uses. The United 
States has pledged to provide financial and technical aid to help 
Ukraine destroy the planes. Earlier this week, a U.S. delegation headed 
by Assistant Secretary of Defense Edward Warner observed Ukrainian 
technicians pulling out the engine and high-tech components from a 
T-160, known in the West as Blackjack, and taking them to storage, 
the Kyiv Post newspaper said. The paper said the mission was ``fuming'' 
because the plane was dismantled but not fully destroyed, as is the 
practice in Russia and Kazakstan. Kuzmuk said that all parts from 
the planes would be used. He said the warplanes would be liquidated 
by 2001 under the START I disarmament agreement _ which was ratified 
by Ukraine in 1993 _ after the two sides work out technical details. 
Kuzmuk did not say how much the program would cost, but press reports 
have put the U.S. aid figure at dlrs 399.2 million for warhead-carrying 
missiles and bombers and another dlrs 7.2 million to scrap strategic 
bomber facilities. Ukraine already has fulfilled its pledge to become 
nuclear-free, turning over all its nuclear warheads _ which comprised 
the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal _ to Russia.
