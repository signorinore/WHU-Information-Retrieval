Catalonia's parliament has passed a resolution claiming the right 
to secede from Spain. The largely symbolic bill was passed Thursday 
night with support from Catalan President Jordi Pujol's party, a nominal 
ally of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar in the national legislature. 
But Pujol was quick to stress that he and his Convergence and Union 
party still respected the Spanish constitution. The bill was sponsored 
by a Catalan party seeking independence for Spain's wealthy, industrialized 
northeast region. The tally was 75 in favor, 15 against and 39 abstentions. 
Among those voting against was Aznar's Popular Party. The main opposition 
party, the Socialists, abstained. A spokeswoman for Pujol's party 
said Friday the resolution did not actually call for independence, 
but rather reaffirmed what she called Catalans' right to decide if 
they want independence. ``It does not say that we should secede,'' 
said the spokeswoman, Elisenda Pifarre. ``It asserts the right to 
ask the Catalan people if they want to or not, through a referendum.'' 
A commission of the Catalan parliament approved a similar bill in 
1989 but it never passed in the legislature as a whole. Thursday's 
vote came as Spain focuses on nationalist aspirations in another important 
region, the Basque country, where the armed separatist group ETA declared 
a ceasefire two weeks ago after three decades of attacks aimed at 
carving out an independent homeland. Pifarre insisted that the regional 
parliament was not competing with Basques for Spain's attention. Still, 
she acknowledged, ``Catalan people don't want to be left behind.''
