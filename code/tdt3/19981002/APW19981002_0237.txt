The Defense Ministry was ordered to pay legal expenses for the family 
of Romania's last communist dictator after keeping the death certificates 
of the slain leader and his wife for nearly a decade, an official 
said Friday. The children of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu sued the 
Defense Ministry in May after a protracted battle to obtain the death 
certificates. They received the papers in late September. But the 
Ceausescus' daughter, Zoe, wanted the ministry to pay legal expenses 
because it ``was responsible for this delay.'' The Bucharest Court 
of Appeal agreed, and Thursday ordered the ministry to pay 500,000 
lei (dlrs 55) to the state for legal expenses. ``We shall go along 
with the court decision and we will not appeal the case because the 
sum is so little,'' Lt. Tiberiu Fratila, a Defense Ministry official, 
said by telephone. In December 1989, the Ceausescus were accused of 
genocide and undermining the nation's economy. Some 1,000 people died 
during the anti-communist uprising as forces loyal to Ceausescu battled 
with street protesters. The Ceausescu were tried by a military court 
and shot by a firing squad.
