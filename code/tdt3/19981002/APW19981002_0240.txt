Thai police said Friday they were investigating whether the death 
of a Chinese woman who plunged from the 13th floor of a Bangkok apartment 
building was a suicide or murder. When police responded to a report 
of what they initially believed was a suicide, they found three other 
women from China locked in a room on the same floor of the building. 
The women said they had been lured to Thailand by members of a Chinese 
gang who then demanded dlrs 3,000 from their families for their release. 
Police were searching for four men who allegedly held the women against 
their will. Security guards at the building said the men left shortly 
before police arrived to inspect the body of Liew Moei Ju, who police 
said also had been held by the men. They suspect the kidnappers may 
have thrown her from the building. Police did not release the victim's 
hometown or province.
