Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Friday said that France will ease 
repayment of Morocco's foreign debt, which has become a huge burden 
for the North African kingdom. Morocco's debt to France is currently 
about 19 billion French francs (dlrs 3.3 billion), or about 17.5 percent 
of the country's total foreign debt. ``France is determined to remain 
Morocco's primary economic partner, its primary investor and its primary 
financial supporter,'' Jospin said before talks with Moroccan Prime 
Minister Abderrahmane Youssoufi. Jospin, however, provided no details 
on just what France intended concretely to do to ease the repayment 
of the debt. The Moroccan leader said that the debt represented his 
country's ``most ``our most serious difficulty in continuing our economic, 
financial, social and human development.'' Morocco's foreign debt 
constitutes about 58 percent of the country's gross domestic product. 
Throughout his visit to France which began Wednesday, Youssoufi has 
been pressing for an easing of the debt and Jospin's remarks came 
as no surprise. ``France has confidence in the Moroccan economy, as 
it has confidence in happy outcome of the democratic process that 
Mr. Yousouffi's government is carrying out,'' Jospin said. Youssouffi 
also said that easing Morocco's debt would help stimulate foreign 
investment as well as permit the Moroccan government to address social 
priorities. The Moroccan prime minister called for some of the country's 
debt to be converted to investment credits and said such a conversion 
would be a big boost for the local economy. He also said easing the 
debt would help free funds for Moroccan government to address social 
priorities. A Socialist, Youssouffi was named prime minister in March 
by King Hassan II, breaking three months of political deadlock after 
legislative elections that left the country without governing coalition.
