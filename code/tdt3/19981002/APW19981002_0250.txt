Ugandan police have released on bail 20 or the 24 people detained 
on suspicion of being involved in a plot to attack the U.S. Embassy 
and Ugandan targets, police spokesman Bob Ngobi said Friday. ``They 
were released on police bond. What normally happens is that if someone 
is held for a period of 24 hours, and evidence against his crimes 
is not found, he is released according to law,'' he said. Ngobi said 
the 20 men were released on bail Wednesday. He said four other men 
_ all Ugandan Muslims _ are still being detained. ``The 20 were arrested 
because they knew something about terrorism. They were released on 
bond pending further investigations and will be reporting to police 
after one week,'' Ngobi said. He declined to give information about 
when the remaining four were arrested, where they were being held 
or when they would appear in court. Police said late last month that 
20 men had been picked up by Ugandan international security officials 
working in conjunction with the FBI. The detentions followed several 
granade attacks on passenger buses in Uganda in which 30 people died 
as well as reports of a foiled attempt to bomb the U.S. diplomatic 
mission. Uganda security officials have increased security at all 
major government installations and diplomatic missions in the capital.
