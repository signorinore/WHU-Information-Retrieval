Iraq has accused United Nations arms inspectors of working with foreign 
intelligence agencies hostile to the country and demanded a special 
investigation into the U.N. commission overseeing the inspections. 
The government made the accusation in a letter from Deputy Prime Minister 
Tariq Aziz to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that was reported 
Thursday night on Iraqi state television and quoted in Friday's Iraqi 
dailies. The Iraqi action follows reports in Israeli and American 
newspapers quoting former arms inspector Scott Ritter as saying he 
dealt with Israeli intelligence and the CIA in seeking information 
on Iraq's weapons program. In his letter Aziz urged an official investigation 
on the U.N. Special Commission's ``connections and intelligence work 
that is hostile to Iraq.'' The letter added such a step was necessary 
to ``guarantee the United Nations' credibility, neutrality, and reputation.'' 
The Iraqi government has long maintained that some of the arms inspectors 
were spies, Ritter in particular, and that the U.N. Special Commission, 
known as UNSCOM, was not a neutral agency but worked under the thumb 
of the United States. The arms inspectors have the job of certifying 
that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction, a necessary 
step under U.N. resolutions before the economic sanctions imposed 
on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait can be lifted. Referring 
to Ritter's quoted comments, Aziz' letter said ``these statements 
show serious facts of which Iraq has warned several times.'' ``UNSCOM, 
which works in the name of the U.N. Security Council ... is firmly 
connected with the intelligence agencies of states that pursue anti-Iraq 
policies,'' the letter said. ``The main source of information UNSCOM 
uses to peddle its false claims, to carry out exposed espionage on 
Iraq, and to fabricate crises, are U.S. and Israeli sources,'' Aziz 
said in the letter. He added that ``the statements by Scott Ritter 
clearly show that UNSCOM had not only collected information, but studied 
with the U.S. and Israeli intelligence services ways to carry out 
its work in Iraq.'' Iraq has long maintained that it has fulfilled 
its obligation under U.N. resolutions, but the arms inspectors say 
the government of President Saddam Hussein continues to hide weapons 
and the means to make more. Ritter, who resigned in an angry letter 
on Aug. 26, has since spoken out several times on Iraq's weapons programs, 
maintaining the United States and Britain did not stand behind UNSCOM 
as it tried to do its job. On Thursday, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard 
said the chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, had criticized Ritter 
for making public details about Iraq's weapons programs. Butler wrote 
a letter to Ritter accusing him of violating his U.N. contract by 
speaking to the press, Eckhard said. One of Ritter's statements, made 
in congressional testimony, was that Iraq has built at least three 
bodies for nuclear bombs and is only lacking uranium to complete the 
nuclear weapons. On Thursday, an Iraqi official repeated Iraq's denial 
that it has developed nuclear devices. ``The International Atomic 
Energy Agency and the United Nations know that Iraq does not have 
nuclear weapons, nor other weapons of mass destruction,'' said Abdel 
Ghani Abdel Ghafour, member of the regional command of ruling Baath 
Party.
