Many Asian markets drifted lower Friday as cautious investors withdrew 
funds following a second day of losses exceeding 200 points in Wall 
Street's key stock index. Taking a cue from the downturn in New York, 
equity markets all around the Pacific rim opened lower amid growing 
concern over the possibility of a worldwide economic slump. Some rebounded 
in late trading, but many others ended the week with additional losses. 
In Europe, meanwhile, London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share 
index was down 140.9 at 4,767.3 in midmorning trading. Singapore's 
Straits Times Index fell 16.03 points, or 1.8 percent, to 899.99 on 
global recession fears triggered by the Dow Jones industrial average's 
two-day tumble, traders said. ``I suppose it's not unexpected given 
what's happened on Wall Street and the other markets,'' said Yang 
Sy Jian, chief economist at Kay Hian Research in Singapore. The Dow, 
which had plunged 237.90 points Wednesday, dropped another 210.09 
points, or 2.7 percent, on Thursday, closing at 7,632.53. The selling 
spree, sparked by worries about shrinking corporate profits and fears 
of new financial crises, left the Dow 18.3 percent, or more than 1,700 
points, below the all-time high of 9,337.97 reached July 17. The closely 
watched stock average slid 12.4 percent in the third quarter, which 
ended Wednesday _ its worst quarterly performance in eight years. 
The Dow is now 3.5 percent below where it began this year. Sinking 
stock prices in New York have kindled doubts about whether top-flight 
Asian manufacturers can rely on strong sales in the United States 
to keep their factories humming amid a prolonged slump in their home 
markets. But some Asian markets shook off early declines triggered 
by the slide in New York overnight, recovering lost ground and finishing 
on an upbeat note. In Tokyo, Japan's benchmark Nikkei Stock Average 
dipped below 13,000 for the first time since January 1986 before reversing 
course and closing up 26.57 points, or 0.20 percent, at 13,223.69. 
Still, investors dumped shares of blue-chip Japanese exporters. Home 
electronics manufacturer Sony Corp. dropped 7 percent to 8,320 yen 
(dlrs 61.73) and tapemaker TDK Corp. plunged almost 11 percent to 
7,720 yen (dlrs 57.28). South Korea's Composite Stock Price Index 
opened lower, but soon recovered and closed at 308.25, up 2.61 points. 
``We had expected a significant fall today too, but it was not so 
bad as we expected,'' said Lee Chu-bum, an analyst at Seoul's Dongwon 
Securities Co. In Australia, the All Ordinaries stock index fell 36.9 
points, or 1.4 percent, closing at 2,532.3. Bank shares led the market 
lower after the drop in financial shares traded overnight in New York, 
but this was partially offset by a rise in mining stocks on higher 
gold prices, traders said. Neighboring New Zealand's NZSE-40 capital 
index lost 26.30 points, closing at 1,668.24 _ its second straight 
day at a five-year low. Bourses in Manila and Taipei were similarly 
hit hard Friday after sharp declines in the previous day's trading. 
The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index retreated 31.70 points, 
or 2.6 percent, ending the week at 1,195.62. In Taiwan, the Weighted 
Price Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange sank 266.06 points, or 3.96 
percent, to 6,346.00. Wall Street worries added to concerns over reports 
that a local transportation conglomerate was unable to meet its payment 
obligations, traders said. Also affected by worries about the global 
economy, Indonesia's JSX Composite Index lost 10.639 points, or 3.9 
percent, closing at 263.229. Hong Kong and Shanghai financial markets 
were closed Friday to celebrate China's National Day holiday.
