Seeking to head off threatened NATO attacks, Yugoslavia's Serb leadership 
on Friday invited the U.N. secretary general to visit, saying that 
would help him understand ``the real situation in Kosovo.'' The invitation, 
carried by the state-run Tanjug news agency, came only days before 
Secretary General Kofi Annan is scheduled to submit a report on compliance 
with a U.N. Security Council resolution, essentially demanding an 
end to the Kosovo offensive by Serbian police and the Yugoslav army. 
And it threatens unspecified further action if the demand is ignored 
_ a condition seen by some NATO countries as opening the door to military 
intervention. In Pristina, capital of Kosovo province, ethnic Albanian 
leader Ibrahim Rugova said Friday NATO military strikes in Kosovo 
would be a humanitarian move that would save the Serbian province's 
majority Albanian population. He spoke on the heels of a series of 
reported massacres of Albanian villagers. ``The most critical issue 
is to stop the war machine of Belgrade and to protect the people of 
Kosovo,'' Rugova told reporters, when asked about the effectiveness 
of any eventual air strikes. ``That's an issue of humanity. Otherwise 
we will be seeing other massacres as we've already seen in the past 
few weeks.'' On Thursday, Britain and the United States failed to 
convince the Russians and Chinese to specifically blame the Serbs 
for the killings at a new U.N. Security Council meeting. The council 
instead strongly condemned the massacres and called on Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic to punish those responsible. In another sign of 
the complexity facing those searching for an end to the crisis, ethnic 
Albanian guerrillas said they did not intend to abandon their battle 
for independence in the majority Albanian province of Serbia, the 
dominant Yugoslav republic. Attacks by the rebel Kosovo Liberation 
Army against police and soldiers led Milosevic to launch the crackdown 
Feb. 28. In Washington, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic 
said his government was willing to have international experts take 
part in an investigation into the massacres to ``establish and prove 
the facts.'' The Foreign Ministry in the capital Belgrade said invitations 
went out to forensic experts from Finland. Serb police have denied 
responsibility for murdering civilians. The Serbs also announced the 
withdrawal of combat forces from battlefields in Kosovo. But ethnic 
Albanian sources claimed fighting continued Thursday along the border 
with Albania, where separatist guerrillas take sanctuary, and Rugova 
challenged the claims of pullbacks, saying the government had forces 
had ``only changed their tactical position.'' He cited a report by 
the Albanian Human Rights Council which says more than 1,400 people 
have been killed since March, more than 100 are missing and 2,000 
have been detained. The United Nations estimates hundreds killed and 
more than 270,000 homeless, including more than 50,000 without shelter 
_ a source of concern ahead of winter. In Washington, Sen. Joseph 
Biden of Delaware, the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, said the United States and its NATO allies should prepare 
to launch an air campaign. ``With the onset of winter only weeks away, 
a humanitarian catastrophe looms,'' Biden said in a speech to a foreign-policy 
group. ``The stability of the entire southern Balkans hangs in the 
balance.'' He spoke Thursday as the Clinton administration began laying 
the groundwork in Congress for possible new NATO air strikes against 
Serb military positions. U.S. President Bill Clinton dispatched his 
national security team Thursday to Capitol Hill to brief lawmakers. 
Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle suggested military action ``may 
be required.'' Despite the Yugoslav offer of outside examination of 
the massacre reports, Robert Gelbard, the U.S. envoy to the Balkans, 
said the massacres have left the Belgrade government with ``no credibility 
at all.'' ``We have seen atrocities piled on atrocities,'' Gelbard 
told the British Broadcasting Corporation. ``Our people in Kosovo 
... have verified that these atrocities have occurred, that these 
latest atrocities that occurred piled on top of previous ones.'' Britain's 
foreign secretary, Robin Cook, told his governing Labor Party that, 
``we don't want to use force'' but warned Milosevic ``that if it will 
take force, Britain is ready to back force.'' In the latest allegation, 
Human Rights Watch said a self-described survivor of one massacre 
supplied chilling new details of alleged atrocities. Peter Bouckaert 
of Human Rights Watch said a wounded Albanian reported that he and 
13 other men were beaten and shot by Serb police Saturday. He was 
the only survivor. Bouckaert said the survivor's story was corroborated 
by other witnesses from Golubovac, a village five kilometers (three 
miles) from Donje Obrinje, site of another massacre.
