A disgruntled former aerospace employee hijacked a company plane with 
15 people aboard Friday, forcing the pilot to land at an airport outside 
Marseille, officials said. The plane, identified as a Falcon 20 belonging 
to Serge Dassault Aviation, landed at Marseille-Marignane Airport 
at 12:30 p.m. (1030 GMT) after being hijacked while on a flight from 
Paris, Marseille police said. The hijacker, armed with a shotgun and 
grenades, first demanded to talk to his lawyer, the police said on 
customary anonymity. He then released 10 hostages unharmed but continued 
to hold the pilot and an undetermined number of other people. He released 
the rest of his hostages and surrendered about two hours after the 
plane landed, police said. Police Prefect, 5th graf pvs
