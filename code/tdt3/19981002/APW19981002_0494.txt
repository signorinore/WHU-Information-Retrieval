Bosnia's debt to various international organizations totals nearly 
8 million marks (dlrs 4.8 million), including 1.5 million marks (dlrs 
900,000) to the United Nations, the Onasa news agency reported Friday. 
Bosnia is the only country created in the break-up of Yugoslavia that 
has not regularly paid its membership dues to the United Nations, 
the daily Oslobodjenje reported. Present-day Yugoslavia, comprised 
of Serbia and Montenegro, is not a member of the international organization. 
Bosnian officials hope to set aside 3 million marks (dlrs 1.8 million) 
as soon as possible to begin paying the country's obligations. The 
money for the budget comes from tax collections and customs duties. 
Because of the amount of debt, the Foreign Ministry has been asked 
to make a list of priorities for payment. The three-man joint presidency 
then will have to sign off on the list. The Foreign Ministry is expected 
to make paying off debt to the United Nations the first priority, 
Oslobodjenje reported. The country also would pay half of what it 
owes to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, the World Health Organization and Interpol. 
``We have chosen these organizations because they have a significant 
number of projects in our country. The non-payment of contributions 
could cause revoking of those projects,'' a Foreign Ministry source 
told Oslobodjenje.
