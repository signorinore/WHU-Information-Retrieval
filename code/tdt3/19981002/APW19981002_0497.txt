A Swissair flight from Bucharest to Zurich made an unscheduled stop 
in Vienna on Friday after an anonymous caller in Bucharest said a 
bomb was on board, officials said. The plane, an Airbus A320 carrying 
68 people, flew on to Switzerland nearly four hours later after no 
bomb was found, said Mario Sante, a spokesman for Vienna International 
Airport. Police removed all the baggage and mail and questioned the 
passengers but learned nothing about a possible bomb, officials said. 
In Romania, the Transport Ministry said the call was received a half-hour 
after Flight 461 left at 8:42 a.m. (0542 GMT). The plane landed in 
Vienna at 8:31 a.m. (0631 GMT) and left at 12:17 p.m. (1017 GMT), 
Sante said. In Zurich, Swissair spokesman Erwin Schaerer said it landed 
safely at Kloten airport at 1:30 p.m. (1130 GMT). The airline had 
no indication of a motive behind the bomb threat or where it came 
from, Schaerer said. Romania's central bank governor, Mugur Isarescu, 
was among the 32 Romanian passengers on board, on his way to Washington 
for a meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, 
a Bucharest radio station reported.
