The foreign partner in Myanmar's flag carrier, Myanmar Airways International, 
has withdrawn its investment in the joint venture, airline industry 
officials said Friday. Highsonic Enterprise Pte. Ltd. of Singapore 
began joint-venture operations with the state-owned Myanma Airways 
in August 1993. The airline initially flew from the Myanmar capital, 
Yangon, to Bangkok, Singapore and Hong Kong. The pullout became effective 
Monday. Local staff were informed last week that the Singapore partner 
was pulling out due to economic difficulties. It was not immediately 
known whether the Myanmar government would continue to run the airline 
alone or if new foreign shareholders would be found. A Myanmar Airways 
International official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined 
to give details about how big Highsonic's investment had been. Myanmar 
Airways International originally leased aircraft from Royal Brunei 
Airlines, and used the airline's pilots and maintenance personnel. 
It later expanded its service to Dhaka, Bangladesh, and leased two 
planes from Malaysian Air Services, together with air crews and maintenance 
staff. The airline was the first joint venture between Myanma Airways 
and a foreign partner. In November 1994, Air Mandalay, a joint venture 
with Mandalay Holdings of Singapore, began a domestic service, adding 
flights to the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai in August 1995.
