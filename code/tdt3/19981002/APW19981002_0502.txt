as the new governor of the state Bank of Norway for a six-year term. 
Gjedrem, 48, will assume leadership of the central bank on Jan. 1, 
following the retirement of current bank governor Kjell Storvik, a 
finance ministry statement said. The new bank governor currently holds 
the highest civil service post in the finance ministry, as finance 
advisor. He also worked as a consultant at the Bank of Norway from 
1975 to 1979. Gjerdrem, an economist, joined the finance ministry 
in 1979. He was seen as a solid and uncontroversial figure, who is 
likely maintain the bank's distance from political meddling. ``He's 
got a good reputation for knowing the subject and being a strong personality,''

in Oslo. Gjedrem was one of 10 applicants for the job, including the 
current deputy central bank governor Jarle Bergo. The finance ministry 
sets Norway's monetary policy, while the central bank uses interest 
rates and other measures to reach the country's goal of maintaining 
a stable value for its national currency, the krone.
