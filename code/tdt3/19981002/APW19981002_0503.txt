In what is the first jail term for a foreign financier, Russian banker 
Alim Karmov was sentenced to five years for asset mismanagement, CTK 
news agency reported. In 1995, Karmov set up the Futurum Aurum investment 
fund in the Czech Republic, using lavish TV ads to attract individual 
investors. One year later he announced that the moeny had money disappeared. 
He was arrested, admitted to fraud and publicly called himself a ``Russian 
beast'', apologizing to Czech creditors. As it turned out, he used 
the fund's full assets worth over one million dollars to pay debts 
of his private construction company. Karamov's activity was seen as 
an attempt to use Russian mafia practices such as pyramid schemes 
in the Czech Republic, but such allegations have not been substantiated. 
Karmov's sentence of five years was appealed by both the prosecution 
and the defendant. Financial mismanagement normally carries a sentence 
of five to twelve years.
