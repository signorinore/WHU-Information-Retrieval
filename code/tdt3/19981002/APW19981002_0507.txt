The chairman of UBS AG resigned Friday in the wake of the announcement 
that the Swiss banking giant will lose 2.2 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 
1.61 billion), largely because of its involvement in a troubled private 
U.S. investment fund. In a press release, Mathis Cabiallavetta said 
``the conviction that I can prove my service to the bank with this 
step moved me to do this.'' Cabiallavetta declined any ``financial 
arrangement,'' the bank's chief executive officer Marcel Ospel said. 
Three other top UBS executives are also leaving, the announcement 
said. Ospel wouldn't discuss possible remuneration for them because 
of contractual terms. Last Thursday, UBS said it would incur a 950 
million franc (dlrs 699 million) charge on its exposure to Long Term 
Capital Management, which with other losses will lead to a third quarter 
after tax-loss of up to 1 billion francs (dlrs 735 million). An internal 
inquiry uncovered lapses by managers in controls and decisions before 
and after the merger, UBS said. It found no signs of gross negligence, 
the bank added. UBS said transactions like LTCM won't reoccur. Ospel 
called its LTCM involvement an extremely complex case in which risk 
was ``very underestimated.'' He said the three executives were aware 
of that and thus left the bank, but said Cabiallavetta wasn't aware 
of all the risks involved. Ospel said the bank will learn lessons 
and improve risk controls. Part of the problem in reconstructing the 
LTCM case, Ospel said, was that the fund only updated its partners 
once a month. For a time, he said, ``we were flying blind.'' The transaction 
with LTCM consisted of an equity investment of around 270 million 
dlrs and a complex options structure, he said. In order to hedge that 
position UBS bought 800 million dlrs worth of shares in the fund. 
For regulatory and accounting reasons, the different legs of the transaction 
weren't booked in the same places which is why the extent of the losses 
went undetected for a long time, Ospel said. Ospel and interim chairman 
Alex Krauer said UBS first informed Swiss federal regulators in early 
September that market turmoil had caused the bank problems. Last week, 
the bank told regulators of its losses' extent and, later in the week, 
of the investigation's findings. Krauer, vice-chairman of UBS and 
also chairman of drug giant Novartis, told a news conference that 
staff changes wouldn't be enough to restore confidence in the bank. 
He regretted the losses but suggested the negative reaction was ``overdone.'' 
``We promise to do everything so as to not disappoint,'' he said, 
adding that a new chairman would be sought quickly. UBS' management 
on Monday reassured employees in a memo that the bank remained sound 
and that it was investigating. The bank said executives leaving by 
``mutual agreement'' include Felix Fischer, chief risk officer of 
UBS; Werner Bonadurer, former co-chief operating office of Warburg 
Dillon Read; and Andrew Siciliano, former head of rates at Warburg. 
After an early rise Friday to 302 francs (dlrs 222) a share, which 
dealers said reflected enthusiasm at the management shake-up, at 0913 
GMT UBS shares were back down to 267 francs (dlrs 196). Stock market 
analysts said Friday more still needs to be done to convince participants 
of UBS' long-term profitability, in particular detailed announcements 
of what the bank plans to do to prevent similar mishaps in the future. 
``Confidence hasn't been restored yet,'' said Gerd Ramsperger, analyst 
at Zuercher Kantonalbank's brokerage research.
