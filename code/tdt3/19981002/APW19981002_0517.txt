A surge in bets favoring a Labor victory in Saturday's election had 
tightened the odds on the result, said Australia's biggest private 
betting agency, CentreBet. A Labor win had started out at 2-1 Friday 
morning but firmed to 7-4 by evening and was expected to shorten even 
further before betting closed at 2 p.m. Saturday, the Alice Springs-based 
agency's manager, Gerard Daffy, said. Prime Minister John Howard's 
governing conservatives had drifted from 1-3 to 2-5 to win and its 
odds looked likely to lengthen again by Saturday. ``On that basis, 
Labor is looking pretty strong for an upset win,'' Daffy said.
