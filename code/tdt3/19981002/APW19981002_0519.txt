Owners of a Philippine ferry that sank outside Manila Bay are negotiating 
on payment for cleaning up oil from the ship that has threatened beach 
resorts, coastal villages and marine life, the coast guard said Friday. 
The coast guard has spent 2 million pesos (dlrs 45,450) for chemicals 
and fuel to battle the oil slick from the Princess of the Orient, 
which sank Sept. 18 in stormy weather off Batangas province, south 
of Manila, said coast guard chief of staff Capt. Herbie Escutin. At 
least 70 people died and 80 others are still missing from the sinking 
of the ferry, which carried 505 people. Escutin said the coast guard 
is asking Sulpicio Lines for an initial deposit of 5 million pesos 
(dlrs 113,600) to buy additional materials and chemicals needed for 
the cleanup. He said the company previously had ignored the demands, 
but began negotiating after the coast guard warned that it might face 
charges or a suspension of its franchise. With some 50,000 liters 
(13,160 gallons) of oil seeping from the ship, the coast guard said 
the slick has reached several coastal areas in Cavite province and 
metropolitan Manila. In some areas, the slick is two inches (5 centimeters) 
thick. It has disrupted and could destroy oyster and fish farms. It 
could also affect a number of beach resorts and damage marine resources. 
The ferry, on its way to central Cebu province, was carrying at least 
600,000 liters (160,000 gallons) of fuel oil and 11,000 liters (3,000 
gallons) of lubricant oil, Coast guard spokesman Lt. Joel Garcia said. 
Sulpicio Lines has a total of 32 ships. It also owned the Dona Paz, 
a ferry that collided with a tanker in 1987, killing 4,341 in the 
world's worst peacetime shipping disaster. A year later, 250 people 
died in the sinking of another ship owned by the company, the Dona 
Marilyn. The captain of the Princess of the Orient has not been found, 
and some officials believe he is in hiding. Maritime officials have 
allowed three of Sulpicio's seven ships with designs similar to that 
of the sunken ferry to return to sea after they were inspected and 
defects were corrected. Four other ships remain to be inspected. The 
vessels of other companies will also be inspected. Ships and ferries 
are the main mode of transportation is this country of 7,107 islands. 
Many of the vessels are old.
