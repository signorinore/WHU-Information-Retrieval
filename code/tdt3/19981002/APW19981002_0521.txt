Stabilizing prices, especially for food, are expected to have eased 
inflation pressures in the Philippines in September. Economists polled 
on Friday forecast September inflation at 10.4 percent year-on-year, 
lower than August's 10.5 percent rate. The data will be released Monday. 
In the eight months through August, inflation averaged 9.3 percent, 
lower than the government's target of 10 percent this year. Inflation 
hit double digits in May for the first time in nearly two years, when 
it reached 10.3 percent. Economists no longer expect average inflation 
to breach the 10 percent mark this year as the impact of a drought 
attributed to the El Nino weather phenomenon on agricultural production 
is declining. However, the impact of expected heavy rains later this 
year has yet to be measured. Still, economists are confident that 
the government is prepared to import food staples such as rice, corn 
and sugar in the event of a shortage in agricultural production in 
the fourth quarter. This would prevent prices from shooting up. ``Food 
prices have been stabilizing and we expect this trend to continue,'' 
said Ricky Lozari, an economist at Abacus Securities Inc. Noel Reyes, 
research head at Anscor Hagedorn Securities Inc., predicts a further 
decline in food prices next year as agricultural production is not 
expected to be affected substantially by weather disturbances. Agricultural 
production is crucial in determining Philippine inflation as it makes 
up around half of the consumer price index. Reyes also pointed to 
recent steady interest rates as an indication of minimal inflationary 
pressures. ``We don't expect any upticks in inflation for the rest 
of the year and steady interest rates are certainly helping,'' he 
said. Audi Pantillano, an economist at Securities 2000 Inc., said 
inflation has ceased to become a major concern in Philippine financial 
markets. ``Unless there is a major, unexpected movement, the currency 
and equities market no longer react strongly to consumer prices,'' 
he said. Economists say regional market developments, such as the 
movement of the yen, are now being more closely monitored by participants 
in local financial markets.
