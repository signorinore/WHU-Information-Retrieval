Tamil Tiger guerrillas handed another 74 bodies of Sri Lankan soldiers 
Friday to the Red Cross, a day after they raised the rebel flag over 
a major town wrested from the military in the deadliest fighting in 
more than two years. At least 1,200 combatants were killed in action 
as the army and rebels traded victories and defeat along the vital 
road through the rebel-controlled north, according to conflicting 
figures released by both sides. Since Wednesday, the International 
Committee of the Red Cross said it has supervised the transfer of 
684 bodies to the military, although the army has acknowledged only 
535 dead among its troops. A spokesman said the military had not identified 
all the corpses given to the Red Cross. Fierce fighting erupted Sunday 
for the towns of Kilinochchi and Mankulam along the highway, the only 
road link between the military-held northern Jaffna Peninsula and 
the mainland. The military has gained control of two-thirds of the 
highway in an offensive that began in May 1997. Both sides suffered 
heavy casualties as the guerrillas captured Kilinochchi, 170 miles 
(275 kilometers) north of Colombo and the military took control of 
Mankulam, 30 kilometers (18 miles) to the south. Although smaller 
than Kilinochchi, Mankulam sits astride a vital junction of an east-west 
road. The military says 443 soldiers were killed at Kilinochchi and 
92 at Mankulam. Another 10 were missing. It also claimed to have killed 
620 rebels _ 520 at Kilinochchi and at least 100 at Mankulam. Hospital 
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 65 wounded soldiers 
died during treatment after they were evacuated to Colombo. Twenty-six 
rebels surrendered at Mankulam, the army officers said on condition 
of anonymity. The clandestine rebel-run radio, Voice of the Tigers, 
said Friday the fighting this week killed 1,000 soldiers and 300 guerrillas. 
Kilinochchi, once an important railhead until civil war engulfed the 
north of this Indian Ocean island in 1983, was controlled by the guerrillas 
from 1990 until the military recaptured it in November 1996. Civilians 
fled the town two years ago. Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan government 
has decided to borrow at least dlrs 100 million from international 
markets to meet the rising defense expenditure in the face of escalating 
fighting, officials said Friday. Last week, the government said the 
defense budget during 1998 was expected to touch dlrs 851 million, 
a 28 percent increase over the earlier estimate of dlrs 667 million.
