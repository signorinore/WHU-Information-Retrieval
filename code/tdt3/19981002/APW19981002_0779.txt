Four years to the day of his last visit, Pope John Paul II arrived 
in Croatia to beatify a controversial World War II cardinal and touch 
off a search for lost moral values. The pontiff's special Alitalia 
plane landed in the capital, Zagreb, at 17:35 p.m. (1535 GMT) Friday 
for a three-day tour. President Franjo Tudjman, Zagreb Archbishop 
Josip Bozanic and papal nuncio Giulio Einaudi were at the airport 
to greet the pope. Residents lined the streets leading from the airport 
to welcome the pontiff on his way to Zagreb Cathedral. Later Friday, 
the pope is expected to address the crowd in front of the Cathedral 
and to visit the tomb of Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac. During his papacy, 
John Paul has beatified 804 people. Stepinac, Zagreb's archbishop 
during World War II, is not one that will go unnoticed. Stepanic welcomed,
