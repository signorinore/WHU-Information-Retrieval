Belgian cyclist Peter Farazijn of the embattled Lotto team has admitted 
possessing endurance drug EPO but denied ever using it. The Lotto 
team has also denied any wrongdoing. The Belgian federation said Friday 
it planned to rule on the issue after next week's World Championships 
in the Netherlands. Farazijn is not part of the Belgian World Championship 
team. Belgian newspapers cited Farazijn saying he had personally bought 
12 vials of EPO and stashed it away. When police searched his home 
part of an investigation into alleged doping within the Lotto team 
earlier this year, Farazijn voluntarily turned over the vials, the 
reports said. ``Maybe I'll become the only cyclist in the whole world 
who will be punished for having EPO without ever using it,'' he was 
quoted as telling the Het Volk newspaper. ``How stupid can you be?'' 
Farazijn was quoted saying he had not yet used the drug because he 
wanted to do it with proper medical guidance. ``The story is not credible 
but it is the bitter truth,'' the paper quoted him as saying. Farazijn 
was part of the Lotto team that participated in the Tour de France 
this summer, when a drug scandal overshadowed cycling's premier event. 
``There is no hurry since the season is over in 10 days. We'll do 
whatever we have to do afterwards,'' federation chairman Laurent De 
Backer said.
