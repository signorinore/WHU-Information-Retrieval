Unless a cease-fire in southern Sudan's civil war is extended beyond 
Oct. 15, the delivery of vital food aid and the lives of hungry children 
will be threatened, an aid agency said Friday. Underscoring its concern, 
CARE International Secretary-General Guy Tousignant said the charity 
_ for the first time _ is playing an active role in trying to solve 
a political problem. ``Everyone's talking peace, but we need actions 
not just words,'' he said after pressuring the government and rebels 
to agree to a cease-fire extension and expansion. Low-level officials 
from each side were scheduled to discuss the cease-fire in Nairobi 
on Monday. A three-month cease-fire to facilitate the aid program 
ends Oct. 15. The government has said it applies to all of the south, 
while the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army said it is restricted 
to Bahr el Ghazal province, where the famine is concentrated. Despite 
the cease-fire, fighting has been raging since Sept. 14 in the southern 
province of East Equatoria. Hunger is a persistent problem in southern 
Sudan, where a 15-year civil war often has led to famine because rebels 
or government-backed militias burned or stole crops that their enemy 
or civilians rely on. About 1.5 million people have died in the fighting 
and famines. This year, the resources of Bahr el Ghazal province quickly 
were depleted. Aid agencies have distributed about 16,400 tons of 
food for an estimated 1.8 million Sudanese threatened by the famine, 
according to a World Food Program report. Although the worst of the 
famine is over, too many people are still dying of hunger, according 
to the United Nations. Tousignant said if the cease-fire ends and 
fighting escalates, aid workers may have to pull out with severe consequences, 
especially for children. ``Many are still too sick to fend for themselves. 
It is likely that all the children in our therapeutic centers will 
die if they are cut off, once again, from any kind of relief,'' said 
Tousignant. CARE is the largest nonsectarian humanitarian agency working 
on both sides of the conflict in Sudan. Programs which began 20 years 
ago include emergency feeding centers as well as development.
