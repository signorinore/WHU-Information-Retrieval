When Pope John Paul II beatifies Croatia's wartime cardinal this weekend, 
he will be honoring one of the Balkans' most controversial figures 
_ a man denounced as a Nazi collaborator but hailed by many Croats 
as a national martyr. Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, who will advance 
toward sainthood with the ceremony Saturday, was tried by the Communists 
in 1946 and sentenced to 16 years imprisonment for collaborating with 
the pro-Nazi Croatian puppet state established by the Germans during 
World War II. The pontiff landed Friday afternoon in the capital, 
Zagreb, beginning a three-day tour. Residents lined the streets leading 
from the airport to welcome the pontiff on his way to Zagreb Cathedral, 
where he will address the crowd. He will later visit Stepinac's tomb. 
Stepinac died in 1960. In 1991, when Croatia broke from Communist 
Yugoslavia, the new nationalist government rehabiliated Stepinac and 
hailed him as a national hero. The differing views of his life illustrate 
the problems facing this newly independent nation struggling to resolve 
its wartime past and define its place in modern Europe. For decades, 
Serbs and many Jews saw Stepinac as a symbol of the fascist state 
that tried to exterminate them. His critics said he blessed fascist 
Croat soldiers, maintained contacts with pro-Nazi leader Ante Pavelic 
and carried out the regime's order to convert Serbs, who are Orthodox 
Christians, to Roman Catholicism. For Croats, Catholicism is one of 
the foundations of their national identity. The Catholic faith separates 
Croats from the Orthodox Serbs who dominated the former Yugoslavia. 
Stepinac was portrayed as a martyr _ the victim of Communist attempts 
to suppress the Roman Catholic Church and stifle the national aspirations 
of the Croat people. Some Croatian media speculate that Stepinac was 
poisoned in prison. The editor of Croatian television's religious 
program section, Tonci Trstenjak, said he hoped the beatification 
``will clear the slandered face of Croatia.'' But the Simon Wiesenthal 
Center, a Nazi-hunting organization, asked the Vatican to postpone 
the ceremony until independent researchers review Stepinac's role. 
The Vatican did not respond to the request and has not made an official 
comment on the controversy. On Friday, its newspaper L'Osservatore 
Romano called Stepinac a ``heroic cardinal.'' Meanwhile, another figure 
from Croatia's Nazi-era past _ Dinko Sakic _ is in jail pending trial 
for war crimes committed while he served as commander of the notorious 
concentration camp Jasenovac, where thousands of Serbs, Jews and anti-fascist 
Croats died. Sakic escaped to Argentina after the war and remained 
free until June, when he was extradited to Croatia to stand trial. 
Croats often cite Stepinac's comments about Jasenovac to defend the 
cardinal as a religious leader who was struggling to make the best 
of a bad situation during the war. In public statements, Stepinac 
called the camp a ``shame.'' When greeting Pavelic at the entrance 
to the Zagreb Cathedral, Stepinac quoted the 7th Commandment: ``Thou 
shalt not kill.'' The cardinal's speeches show that as early as 1942, 
he was speaking out, albeit carefully, against the excesses of the 
regime. ``All nations and races are from the God and they all have 
a right to live,'' Stepinac said at a Mass in 1942 when killings in 
Jasenovac and other camps were in full swing. ``That is why the Croatian 
church has always condemned injustice and violence committed in the 
name of class, racist or ethnic theories.'' Stepinac's admirers also 
argue that by ``allowing'' Serbs and Jews to convert to Catholicism, 
he was trying to give them a chance to escape persecution. Croatia's 
Jewish community, which lost 30,000 members during the war, said they 
were ``grateful'' to Stepinac for saving the lives of many Jews. However, 
in a statement released Wednesday, they said that ``the time will 
judge'' him.
