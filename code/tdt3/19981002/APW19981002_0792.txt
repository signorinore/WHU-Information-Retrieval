Romania's defense ministry was ordered to pay legal expenses to the 
family of Romania's last communist dictator for their lengthy battle 
to get their parents' death certificates, a defense official said 
Friday. The children of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu sued the Defense 
Ministry in May after an almost 10-year battle to obtain the death 
certificates. They received the papers in late September. Ceausescu 
was overthrown in December 1989 and the couple was executed by firing 
squad on Christmas Day after a brief trial by a military court. The 
Ceausescus' daughter, Zoe, wanted the ministry to pay legal expenses 
because it ``was responsible for this delay.'' The Bucharest Court 
of Appeal agreed, and Thursday ordered the ministry to pay 500,000 
lei, or about dlrs 55, to the state for legal expenses. Legal expenses 
are generally inexpensive in Romania. ``We shall go along with the 
court decision and we will not appeal the case because the sum is 
so little,'' said Lt. Tiberiu Fratila, a Defense Ministry official.
