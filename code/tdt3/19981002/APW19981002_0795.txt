Fear of kidnapping has forced out the last Catholic church workers 
in Somalia _ three sisters whose hospital provided vital care for 
mothers and children, the Vatican's missionary news service reported 
Friday. The nuns' departure follows the kidnapping at gunpoint of 
another sister working at the SOS charity hospital in the Somali capital, 
Mogadishu. The three remaining sisters _ ages 60, 52 and 57 _ left 
Sept. 26, the Fides news service said. In an open letter to the people 
of Mogadishu, the sisters of the Missionaries of Consolation said 
the decision ``was made necessary by numerous recent threats'' that 
have ``made precarious the safety of our workers.'' The group expressed 
hope for a resolution ``that would permit our sisters to resume their 
humanitarian mission in Mogadishu.'' The nun kidnapped Sept. 10 was 
released after three days and heavy pressure from mothers and others 
in the general community. The abductors were sentenced to one year 
in prison _ the first trial for kidnapping since the start of civil 
strife in 1990. Somalia disintegrated into a fiefdom of clans after 
the ouster of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. Since then, militiamen 
out to make money or exert pressure in disputes have kidnapped more 
than 100 foreigners, including aid workers. The sisters' hospital 
was the main provider of maternity and child care in Mogadishu, serving 
Somalis without charge. It treated 500 children a week, Fides said.
