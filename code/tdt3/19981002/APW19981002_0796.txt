Secretary-General Kofi Annan has no plans to travel to Kosovo, despite 
an invitation Friday from the Yugoslav leadership to visit the region, 
U.N. officials said. Annan has declined the invitation, saying that 
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, had just visited 
the region and that other U.N. officials were there and were reporting 
to him, spokesman Fred Eckhard said. He noted that Yugoslav foreign 
minister, Zivadin Jovanovic, had met with the U.N. chief on Tuesday 
and suggested Annan visit the region ``to see for himself,'' what 
was happening in Kosovo, where Serb forces are trying to crush a separatist 
movement by the ethnic Albanian majority. Jovanovic said he felt Annan 
was not informed and criticized the U.N. stance on Kosovo, Eckhard 
said. The invitation, carried Friday by the state-run Tanjug news 
agency, came after an ethnic Albanian man gave human rights workers 
a graphic account of what he said was a massacre of 13 ethnic Albanian 
men by Serbian police in a Kosovo forest on Saturday. As well, diplomats, 
journalists and human rights workers reported seeing as many as 18 
mutilated bodies in the forests around the Kosovo town of Obrija earlier 
this week. Annan said Thursday that the fighting must stop. ``I utterly 
condemn these unwarranted killings and excesses by the Serb security 
forces and I think violence by all sides must stop immediately,'' 
he said. ``If it doesn't stop and we don't have access to the displaced 
and refugees in need, there will be a humanitarian disaster.'' His 
comments came as the Security Council condemned the massacre and called 
on Yugoslav President Slobodon Milosevic to immediately identify and 
punish those responsible.
