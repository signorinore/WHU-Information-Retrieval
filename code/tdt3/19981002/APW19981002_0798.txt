Germany's chancellor-elect, Gerhard Schroeder, will meet U.S. President 
Bill Clinton in Washington on Oct. 9, the Social Democrats announced 
Friday. Schroeder made his first foreign trip as Germany's future 
chancellor on Wednesday, traveling to Paris just three days after 
he led the Social Democrats' defeat of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian 
Democrats in Sunday's election. Schroeder has assured Germany's allies 
that the nation's foreign policy will not change under his center-left 
government. Schroeder has also announced plans to meet Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin in Moscow. The Social Democrats opened talks Friday 
with the environmentalist Greens to form a governing coalition that 
will succeed Kohl's center-right government after 16 years. The new 
parliament is expected to convene for the first time on Oct. 26, and 
confirm Schroeder as chancellor on Oct. 27. Details of Schroeder's 
Washington trip were not immediately available.
