Albania's new Socialist-led government was sworn in Friday by President 
Rexhep Mejdani, only hours after new Prime Minister Pandeli Majko 
announced agreement on the makeup of the Cabinet. Earlier attempts 
by Majko to reach agreement with his coalition partners failed after 
a minority party demanded the deputy prime minister's slot. The Socialists, 
who held the position in the previous government, refused to give 
up the post. The Social Democrats withdrew their demands Friday, and 
accepted the posts of minister of transportation and minister of public 
works. At the swearing in ceremony, Mejdani told the new ministers 
that ``your commitment is a sacrifice in this difficult period Albania 
is going through.'' The government lineup features six new names, 
including Interior Minister Petro Koci and Musa Ulqini, who heads 
the newly created Ministry of Information. Former Minister of Works 
Anastas Angjeli became the new finance minister.
