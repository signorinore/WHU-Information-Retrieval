Hillary Rodham Clinton told 1,000 women from throughout the hemisphere 
Friday that now is the time for women to make great gains in their 
political and economic status. ``If we take our energy and work together 
... I think we have a great opportunity ahead of us,'' she said in 
a keynote address to the ``Vital Voices of the Americas'' conference, 
a U.S. foreign policy initiative begun last year. If women's voices 
continue to be heard in city halls and boardrooms and at the highest 
circles of political power, reminding the world that the big issues 
concern not just women but societies, then the fruits of democracy 
and prosperity will be spread more widely and deeply than ever before, 
she said. Mrs. Clinton, considered an inspiration by many women at 
the conference, said that as she travels the world and meets women 
in all walks of life, ``I'm always amazed, impressed and humbled by 
the extraordinary human spirit and hopefulness that I find. ... I'm 
always with women who inspire me.'' Mrs. Clinton was welcomed with 
scattered cheers from the audience already on its feet for the arrival 
of Uruguayan first lady Marta Canesa de Sanguinetti. Along with encouraging 
women to pursue greater gains and to share their knowledge with other 
women _ a prime purpose of the Vital Voices meeting _ Mrs. Clinton 
announced new U.S. government programs to promote women. The initiatives 
include dlrs 50 million from the Agency for International Development 
to strengthen human rights, justice and democracy. AID will also increase 
its loans to small enterprises in the hemisphere to dlrs 120 million 
over the next three years, more than two-thirds of the loans going 
to women. Women at the conference said they were thrilled Mrs. Clinton 
addressed the meeting. ``I wish we could have more women like you 
around the world,'' Eva Morales of Guatemala said in a speech prior 
to Mrs. Clinton's address. ``We appreciate you. We love you,'' she 
said to applause. Gladys Aida Caballero, vice president of Honduras, 
said in an interview: ``I'd like her to be the first woman president 
of the United States.'' Mrs. Clinton's four-day trip to South America 
was all about women, featuring a speech to the first ladies of the 
Americas meeting in Santiago, Chile, and a rousing talk Thursday to 
the multiparty Women's Political Network in Uruguay. Her campaign 
for women's rights wasn't just about political success. It also was 
about money, including access to credit. Such access ``is one of the 
surest ways to change women's lives around the world,'' enabling them 
to start their own businesses, generating income for their families, 
she told the Uruguayan women packed Thursday into an ornate ballroom 
of the Legislative Palace. ``Unfortunately, many commercial banks 
don't see women as good credit risks,'' she said, despite studies 
showing poor women paid off their debts at a rate of 95 percent to 
99 percent.
