Four years to the day of his last visit, Pope John Paul II arrived 
in Croatia to beatify a controversial World War II cardinal and touch 
off a search for lost moral values. The pontiff's special Alitalia 
plane landed in the capital, Zagreb, at 17:35 p.m. (1535 GMT) Friday 
for a three-day tour. President Franjo Tudjman, Zagreb Archbishop 
Josip Bozanic and papal nuncio Giulio Einaudi were at the airport 
to greet the pope. The pope kissed Croatian soil held up to him in 
a bowl. Visiting the area that was devastated in the 1991 war between 
Croats and the country's ethnic Serb minority, the pope called for 
reconciliation among different ethnic and religious groups and efforts 
for greater democracy. ``I hope most fervently that in this part of 
Europe there will never again be repetition of the inhuman situations 
which we have repeatedly seen in the century,'' the pontiff said in 
the speech at the airport. Speaking in Croatian, he addressed the 
country's emergence from both communism and war, saying: ``Croatia 
is finally experiencing a period of peace and freedom.'' Residents
