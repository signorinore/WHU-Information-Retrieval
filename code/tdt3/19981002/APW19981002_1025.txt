Israel closed its borders with the Palestinian territories on Friday 
in efforts to prevent what Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said 
were plans for an ``unprecedented, horrific'' attack that could set 
back peace talks. The army was trying to prevent a bombing by the 
Islamic militant group Hamas, which could hamper Israeli-Palestinian 
negotiations on an Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank. Although 
Israeli officials said the U.S.-brokered talks have brought some advances 
toward a deal they hope to conclude in a four-day summit in Washington 
in mid-October, the Palestinians remained skeptical. Hamas has vowed 
to carry out attacks against Israel after Israeli soldiers killed 
two of the group's leaders last month. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu said Friday that the security forces could not be totally 
effective in combating terror groups. ``We have to know that, during 
this fight, we will take some blows,'' Netanyahu told public television. 
``We are working against those murderers so there will be less attacks 
or none at all.'' Netanyahu said he would judge the seriousness of 
the Palestinian Authority in peace talks by its willingness to crack 
down on militant groups. Israeli and Palestinian security forces have 
prevented bombing attempts in recent weeks by Hamas whose attacks 
since 1994 have killed dozens of Israelis. Palestinian police caught 
two Hamas members with 60 kilos (130 pounds) of explosives in the 
Gaza Strip a week ago and uncovered a bomb factory of the group with 
almost a ton of explosives in the West Bank city of Hebron, security 
officials said. Another Hamas member was killed earlier this week 
when a car he was in exploded in a West Bank village. As the forces 
tried to avert attacks, the peace talks were not getting anywhere, 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Friday. Arafat said no great 
progress had been made in his two meetings with Netanyahu last month 
in the United States.
