No. 1 seed Greg Rusedski crushed French challenger Arnaud Clement 
6-4, 6-1 on Friday to qualify for the semifinals of the dlrs 400,000 
Toulouse Open tennis tournament. Britain's Rusedski took just 56 minutes 
to win his quarterfinal contest 6-4, 6-1. Unseeded Clement, 20, dropped 
his opening service game and always looked second best against the 
world No. 14, who clinched the match by winning six straight games. 
In the last four, Rusedski will face Germany's Nicolas Kiefer, a 6-2, 
3-6, 6-1 winner over Marc Rosset of Switzerland. Roger Federer, the 
17-year-old junior Wimbledon champion, saw his fine run end when he 
lost to No. 2 seed Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands, 7-6, 6-2. Federer 
has caused a sensation in Toulouse by beating two top 50 players, 
Richard Fromberg of Australia and France's Guillaume Raoux, both in 
straight sets, in his first professional tournament. A third shock 
looked on the cards when the first set went into a tiebreak, but the 
Dutch player squeezed through 7-5, and proved too strong in the next 
set, eventually winning 7-6 (7-5), 6-2. In the next round, Siemerink 
will face either No. 3 seed Thomas Johansson of Sweden or unseeded 
Frenchman Stephane Huet.
