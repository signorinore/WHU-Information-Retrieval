Wolfgang Thierse, a bearded, outspoken Social Democrat from former 
East Germany, is seen as the top candidate to take over as president 
of parliament, sources in the leftist party said Friday. Thierse, 
who will be 55 on Oct. 22, would replace Rita Suessmuth of the Christian 
Democrats, who is stepping down after Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservatives 
were defeated by the Social Democrats in Sunday's national elections. 
While Thierse grew up in East Germany, he never joined the communist 
party. He lost his job in the culture department of Humboldt University 
in East Berlin for taking sides with dissident singer Wolf Biermann 
who was banned to the west by the communists in 1976. Thierse joined 
the Social Democrats after the party regrouped in East Berlin in early 
1990 before unification and has been a member of the Bundestag - or 
lower house of parliament - since winning a seat in all German elections 
later that year. A resident of the Prenzlauer Berg district of East 
Berlin, Thierse often drew frowns from his western party colleagues 
for arguing that government and parliament should move back to the 
capital of Berlin to show unity with the eastern states. In the end 
Thierse got his wish after a majority of parliament voted in 1991 
to return to what was always seen as the official capital. The Berlin 
move is to be completed next summer and would be all the sweeter to 
Thierse if parliament votes him president in its first session expected 
on Oct. 26 or 27.
