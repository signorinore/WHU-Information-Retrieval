Police in southwestern Poland arrested two Italian men Friday, who 
are wanted on international warrants for armed assaults and car smuggling 
in Italy. Identified only as Alessandro B. and Giovanni B., both 30 
and from Genoa, the two were found in Lwowek Slaski, some 460 kilometers 
(285 miles) southwest of Warsaw, during a police investigation of 
feuds between the local gangs, police spokesman Pawel Biedziak said. 
Biedziak said the two were involved in prostitution and organized 
the smuggling of alcohol and cigarettes between Poland, the Czech 
Republic and Germany whose borders meet in the region. Both remained 
arrested pending extradition to Italy, Biedziak said. Last month five 
men, two of them car smugglers, were shot in the region in what police 
believe to be a war of gangs that thrive on smuggling drugs and cars, 
between the three neighboring countries.
