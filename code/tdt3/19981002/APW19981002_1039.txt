With the clock ticking down to possible NATO airstrikes, Serb authorities 
scrambled Friday to show they are complying with U.N. demands to pull 
back their forces and bring peace to Kosovo. The ethnic Albanians' 
political leader called it a false show, and said NATO strikes on 
Serbia would be welcome. ``The most critical issue is to stop the 
war machine of Belgrade and to protect the people of Kosovo,'' said 
Ibrahim Rugova, who long has advocated pacifism to settle the Serb-Albanian 
standoff in Kosovo. ``That's an issue of humanity.'' In a flurry of 
moves, the Serbs invited U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to visit 
the southern Serbian province, issued a new appeal for talks with 
ethnic Albanian negotiators, removed a key police roadblock and showed 
reporters heavy equipment they said has been withdrawn. But Annan 
turned down the offer and the ethnic Albanians indicated they aren't 
willing to talk with fighting still continuing. Britain and the United 
States, keeping up the pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, 
warned strongly that the time to prevent intervention is running out. 
``We cannot allow this conflict to spread again and risk what we stopped 
in Bosnia starting over again in Kosovo,'' U.S. President Bill Clinton 
said. The international furor over the Serbs' eight-month crackdown 
in separatist Kosovo has intensified this week, pushing the United 
States and other countries to the verge of long-threatened airstrikes. 
The Serbs' efforts to crush separatist resistance in the province, 
which is populated largely by ethnic Albanians, has killed hundreds 
of people and driven an estimated 275,000 from their homes. Even as 
the Serbs said this week that they were halting their action against 
Kosovo ``terrorists,'' evidence surfaced of at least two massacres 
of civilians in the Drenica region within recent days. Claiming that 
media reports wrongly portray the situation in Kosovo, Serb authorities 
said Annan should come himself to see the ``real situation.'' But 
Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said the secretary-general was already 
receiving reports from U.N. officials in the area. Late Friday, the 
independent Beta news agency said Serbia's Deputy Premier Ratko Markovic 
had invited an ethnic Albanian negotiating team to meet as soon as 
possible to resume the political dialogue which broke down last May. 
But Fehmi Agani, chief ethnic Albanian negotiator, said the letter 
seemed to be intended to ease some of the increasing international 
pressure on Serbia rather than a sincere move. ``I don't see how negotiations 
can possibly continue at this point when the fighting in Kosovo has 
not ceased to this date,'' Agani said. Things were moving on the ground 
in Kosovo. Serb police removed a roadblock on the road from Pristina 
to Pec, a highly visible symbol of the heavy police presence in Kosovo. 
At the same time, Serb officials hastened to show reporters heavy 
police equipment and weapons they say have been withdrawn from the 
Kosovo conflict. Many of the men, they say, have been sent on leave. 
But Rugova and the ethnic Albanians weren't buying the Serbs' statements. 
``The Serb military forces have not withdrawn from Kosovo, they have 
only changed their tactical position,'' Rugova told reporters. ``The 
situation continues to be grave and dangerous.'' The Kosovo Information 
Center, close to the province's ethnic Albanian leadership, reported 
Serb forces attacked two villages Friday near Malisevo in southwestern 
Kosovo, then sent in reinforcements when KLA rebels showed heavy resistance. 
It also said 20 more bodies had been discovered in the Drenica region, 
some near the site where civilians were massacred last weekend. For 
its part, the pro-Serb Media Center said Yugoslav army border guards 
came under grenade-launcher fire from inside Albania's territory near 
the Pogaj border outpost opposite Prizren, Kosovo. The top Serbian 
official in Kosovo lashed out at what he said were ``daily fabrications 
of new massacres by the ethnic Albanian propaganda machine.'' Veljko 
Odalovic, head of the provincial government, accused world powers 
of helping terrorists in Kosovo by threatening Serbia and the Yugoslav 
Federation. Britain, among the most vocal supporters of NATO action 
as a last resort, joined the United States in delivering a strong 
warning. ``This is a humanitarian disaster,'' Prime Minister Tony 
Blair told Channel 4 TV News in London. ``I believe it will only be 
stopped if Milosevic gets the clearest possible message ... namely, 
if you carry on doing this, you will face a military penalty.'' But 
Russia's parliament declared any NATO military action taken without 
U.N. approval would be considered an ``illegal act of aggression.''
