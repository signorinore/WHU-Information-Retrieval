Britain said Friday it will send four more fighter-bombers to a NATO 
base in southern Italy as part of the buildup over the Serbian province 
of Kosovo. Defense Secretary George Robertson said the GR7 Harrier 
jump jets will fly Monday from Laarbruch, a British base in Germany, 
to Gioia del Colle, bringing the number of Royal Air Force warplanes 
there to eight. ``This deployment shows that we mean business and 
if the violence does not stop, then Britain will play its full part 
in what needs to be done,'' Robertson said. Senior representatives 
from the six Contact Group countries _ the United States, Britain, 
Germany, France, Italy and Russia _ met here Friday and said that 
they were ''united in condemning what is happening on the ground'' 
in Kosovo, where a Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels wanting 
independence has left hundreds dead and more than 270,000 homeless 
since it began in February. ``We all concluded that time is running 
out,'' a statement from the six said in reference to possible NATO 
military action. ''We are determined to get compliance one way or 
another,'' a British Foreign Office spokesman, speaking on terms of 
customary anonymity, said after the talks. The group want Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to halt military action in Kosovo, allow 
humanitarian agencies into the province and agree to a long-term peace 
solution. Also Friday, the government warned Britons not to travel 
to Yugoslavia, and England canceled a soccer match with Yugoslavia 
which was to have been played in London Nov. 18. The English Football 
Association said it acted now to end uncertainty over the fixture. 
The Foreign Office said Britons in Yugoslavia should consider leaving 
now, or be prepared to go at short notice. Prime Minister Tony Blair 
again warned of military reprisals if attacks against ethnic Albanians 
_ blamed on Serbs _ continued in Kosovo. ``The objective is the same 
as the objective throughout, which is to make him (President Slobodan 
Milosevic) stop committing atrocities and barbarism within Kosovo,'' 
Blair told Channel 4 News. ``This is a humanitarian disaster. I believe 
it will only be stopped if Milosevic gets the clearest possible message, 
which is an unmixed message, namely, if you carry on doing this you 
will face a military penalty.'' Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber 
Serbs 9-1 in the two million population, is in southern Serbia, the 
dominant Yugoslav republic.
