Although nationwide elections produced less change than hoped, the 
election results certified Friday have increased the power of moderates. 
Election supervisors announced the official results and the allocation 
of seats for the legislative bodies in voting that took place three 
weeks ago. ``Pluralism has won today,'' said U.S. Ambassador Robert 
Barry, the head of the Bosnian branch of the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe charged with organizing and supervising 
the elections. Parties considered moderate for the most part won at 
all levels, apart from the disappointing victory of ultra-nationalist 
Nikola Poplasen over moderate Biljana Plavsic for president of the 
Bosnian Serb half of the country. Under the Bosnian peace agreement 
negotiated in Dayton, Ohio, in 1995 Bosnia was divided into two halves 
_ the Bosnian Serb republic and the Muslim-Croat Federation. Both 
have their own parliaments, governments and presidents. The entities 
are loosely linked by a joint presidency, parliament and government. 
Previously, hard-line nationalist parties, seeking the division of 
the country had the majority and blocked the peace process, forcing 
international officials on the ground to impose solutions. Barry believes 
the elections will entail authorities who are ``more responsive to 
the will of the people.'' He said the message of the voters to their 
leaders was: ``Get on with the issues that are a concern to us, act 
responsibly, make decisions for yourselves and don't wait for the 
international community to make them for you!'' For the first time, 
some minority parties are represented in parliaments of the country. 
The Serb National Assembly may play a key role in the future, since 
it can approve or reject Poplasen's proposals for a premier in case 
he offers a hard-liner like himself. It was important that ``nobody 
in that parliament has a blocking majority as was the case in the 
past,'' Barry said. Pro-Dayton forces have won more seats over hard-liners 
on all levels. With the general elections certified, international 
institutions in Bosnia will move over to the harder part - the implementation 
of results and monitoring the work of the new authorities. ``We expect 
those parties which have won mandates from the electorate to respect 
democratic principles in forming executive bodies,'' Barry said.
