The Associated Press has appointed two deputy international editors. 
Sally Jacobsen, an economics specialist who has spent nearly a decade 
in international reporting, will become deputy international editor, 
concentrating on the day-to-day world news report and enterprise. 
Kevin Noblet, who has been deputy international editor since 1993, 
will become deputy international editor/training. He will concentrate 
on identifying prospective international correspondents, training 
them in advance of their assignments and monitoring their performance 
abroad. The appointments were announced Friday by AP International 
Editor Thomas J. Kent. Jacobsen joined the AP in 1976 in Baltimore. 
Beginning in 1979, she worked for six years in the news cooperative's 
Washington bureau, specializing in economic reporting. She then worked 
in Mexico City and for seven years in Brussels as correspondent for 
the European Union and NATO affairs. Jacobsen held a Jefferson Fellowship 
for Asian studies at the East-West Center in Honolulu in 1996 and 
then joined AP's Business News Department in New York, specializing 
in international economic issues. A Colorado native, she earned a 
bachelor's degree from Iowa State University and a master's from Cornell 
University. Noblet joined the AP in New Orleans in 1980 after working 
for newspapers in Connecticut. He spent nine years based in Argentina, 
Chile and Puerto Rico before becoming deputy international editor 
in New York. A graduate of Concordia College in Bronxville, Noblet 
was a 1990-91 Nieman Fellow at Harvard University.
