With rock bands, giant screens and tens of thousands of people on 
the streets, Croatia rolled out the welcome mat Friday for Pope John 
Paul II as he came to honor a World War II cardinal held as a hero 
by Catholics but accused by Serbs of sympathizing with the Nazis. 
It was John Paul's second visit to the country, considered by the 
Vatican a Catholic bastion in the Balkans. When he first came in 1994, 
the Balkans war was still raging following the breakup of Yugoslavia. 
``Now, happily. the war is no more,'' he told a crowd of young people 
standing shoulder-to-shoulder in the cathedral square in Zagreb's 
medieval city center. ``My hope is that there will never again be 
war in this noble country,'' he said to sustained applause. He then 
entered the cathedral, knelt and prayed for two minutes before the 
glass tomb of Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, embalmed in red and gold 
vestments and a gold miter. John Paul is scheduled to beatify Stepinac 
on Saturday in Marija Bistrica, the country's leading Marian shrine, 
outside of Zagreb. Beatification is the last step before possible 
sainthood. While serving as Zagreb's archbishop in 1941, Stepinac 
supported Croatia's German-backed fascist puppet government led by 
dictator Ante Pavelic. By 1942, however, Stepinac denounced the regime's 
genocidal policies, which led to the extermination of thousands of 
Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and Croat opponents. Stepinac's own notes and 
recent studies say he spoke out against the atrocities, and worked 
to save lives, but many Serbs still consider him a war criminal. After 
the war, the cardinal was tried by Yugoslavia's communist government 
and sentenced to prison for collaboration with the Nazis. He died 
while under house arrest, the basis of the Vatican's finding that 
he died for his faith. The 78-year-old pope, slowed by a series of 
ailments in recent years, appeared in good form and delighted by the 
welcome. He walked with a cane at the airport, but handed it to an 
aide when he reached the cathedral. The streets were packed, with 
well-wishers following his drive in from the airport in the white 
popemobile on giant streets erected in downtown Zagreb. Helicopters 
whirred overhead, above the cathedral spires. Two bands warmed up 
the crowd. In arrival remarks, he called on Croats to spur reconciliation 
among the nation's ethnic, religious and political groups. In a gentle 
jab at the government that has ruled since Croatia broke from communist 
Yugoslavia, he urged ``an ever greater democratization of society.'' 
``The obstacles created by the consequences of war and the mentality 
shaped by the Communist regime are many,'' the pope said. ``I hope 
most fervantly that in this part of Europe there will never again 
be a repetition of the inhuman situations which we have repeatedly 
seen in this century.'' At the airport to greet him was President 
Franjo Tudjman, who complained that ``certain international factors 
are pressuring us,'' an apparent reference to calls by the West for 
Croatia to strengthen its democratic institutions. Both Tudjman and 
the pope spoke of Croatia's long Catholic history, with John Paul 
referring to persecution under the Romans, the Ottoman occupation 
and ``the terrible period of Communist repression.'' The Vatican was 
one of the first countries to recognize an independent Croatia. Of 
the country's 4.5 million citizens, the Vatican estimates 80 percent 
are Catholic.
