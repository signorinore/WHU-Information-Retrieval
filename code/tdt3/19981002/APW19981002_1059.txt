The last time the Winston Cup circuit visited Charlotte Motor Speedway, 
Jeremy Mayfield had a much better view of the season points race. 
Mayfield goes into Sunday's UAW-GM Quality 500 in sixth place in the 
1998 driver standings, virtually eliminated from title contention. 
With six races left, he is 784 points behind leader Jeff Gordon. It's 
a far different from late May, when the series rolled into Charlotte 
for its all-star race and the Coca-Cola 600 on consecutive weekends. 
At that time, Mayfield was the Winston Cup points leader. ``It's been 
a learning experience,'' he said. ``We've had some ups and downs _ 
probably more downs than ups. But I think it's going to be something 
that's going to help us in the future.'' Consistency wasn't a problem 
early in the year, even though the team was reorganized during the 
offseason and switched from the Ford Thunderbird to the Taurus. Mayfield 
was third in the season-opening Daytona 500, one of six top-10 finishes 
he had in the first 10 races. A second-place finish at the California 
500 put him atop the points standings for the first time in his career, 
and on June 21, he added another important first to the list by winning 
the Pocono 500 for his inaugural Winston Cup victory. That was the 
last time Mayfield would lead the points race. He finished 18th in 
the next event at Sears Point Raceway, starting a stretch of five 
races in which he didn't post any top-10 finishes. Culprits included 
a blown tire one week and a poor pit stop the next. Several times, 
the car just didn't run well. The bad stretch dropped him to sixth 
in the points, and he's been unable to get any higher since. But Mayfield 
remains optimistic, and team co-owner Michael Kranefuss shares his 
view. Their position is supported by top-five finishes in two of the 
last four races. Mayfield will start ninth Sunday at Charlotte, where 
he has raced 10 times and never finished better than 19th. No matter 
what happens during the race, Mayfield considers it another chance 
to learn and grow as he points toward his ultimate goal of winning 
a season title. ``I've been in different situations I've never been 
in before,'' he said. ``I've gained a lot of experience, but I feel 
like I still need more.''
