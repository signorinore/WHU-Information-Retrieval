Responding to the recent United Nations resolution on Kosovo, the 
Yugoslav government on Friday blamed the violence on ethnic Albanian 
separatist rebels. ``The federal government understands the concern 
expressed by the U.N. Security Council about Kosovo,'' the government 
said in a statement carried by the Tanjug news agency, but rejects 
the criticism of it. It claimed that fighting has ended in Kosovo 
following a string of defeats of the ethnic Albanian guerrillas. The 
government stressed that authorities have opened an investigation 
to determine the culprits in the recent massacre of ethnic Albanians 
in Kosovo. ``The federal government expresses regret that the world 
has reacted so sharply and with threats to uninvestigated information 
while it remained silent to earlier monstrous crimes'' against Serb 
civilians in Kosovo, the statement said. ``Such double standards have 
brought no good anywhere,'' said the government, protesting what it 
called a ``staged anti-Serb media campaign.'' The government also 
announced a new session of the Yugoslav federal parliament to discuss 
how to ``protect international position and state interests'' of the 
country.
