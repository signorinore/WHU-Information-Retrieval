A fiery explosion blew apart a car in a crowded quarter of Naples 
on Friday, injuring 13 people, police said. Authorities suspected 
a car bomb planted by one of the city's warring crime clans. One of 
the injured was reported in grave condition. The blast went off outside 
a game room frequented by a clan of the Camorra crime syndicate, Italy's 
ANSA news agency said. Most of the victims were innocent passers-by 
_ local artisans, waiters or young men driving by on motorbikes, the 
news agency said. The blast and the resulting fire destroyed at least 
five other cars. It blew out windows in surrounding homes on the narrow 
street and blackened building facades up to their fifth floors. The 
bomb was apparently on or under a stolen car parked outside the game 
room. Authorities believe it may have been detonated by remote control. 
The blast occurred in an area where two clans of the Camorra crime 
syndicate are fighting for control. Attacks that hurt such a large 
number of bystanders are unusual even in gang wars; authorities feared 
it might signal a worsening of hostilities, RAI state television said.
