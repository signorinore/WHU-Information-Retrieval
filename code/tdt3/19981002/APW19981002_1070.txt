A UEFA Task Force announced Friday a new format it's considering for 
a revamped European Champions' Cup to counter the launch of a proposed 
breakaway European Super League. Following 3 1/2 hours of meetings 
with several of Europe's biggest clubs, the European Football 2000 
Task Force unveiled two concepts it was considering for a new league 
that would pay out 600-800 million Swiss francs (dlrs 440-590 million) 
in total prize money. ``The winners have the possibility to win between 
60-80 million Swiss francs,'' said UEFA General Secretary Gerhard 
Aigner. ``It depends of the format the executive committee chooses 
next week at meetings in Lisbon.'' UEFA revealed it is considering 
two different concepts for a remodelled Champions' League - one involving 
24 teams and another with 32. The Task Force also proposed to merge 
the UEFA Cup and the Cup Winners' Cup into one competition. The 24-team 
model was the preferred one, UEFA said, since it involved just 15 
match days, more easily shoehorned into an already tight schedule. 
The format of a UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup merger had not yet been 
developed, but would likely include 114 teams playing in preliminary 
rounds followed by knock-out matches. The proposals are in response 
to a Super League conceived by a Milan-based marketing firm, Media 
Partners, currently attempting to lure some of the biggest names in 
European soccer _ including Bayern Munich, Ajax, Inter and AC Milan, 
Manchester United and Arsenal _ into its new competition with a reported 
dlrs 1.2 billion in prize money. Though falling significantly short 
of the Super League's jackpot, UEFA was quick to insist its prize 
money was guaranteed. ``At UEFA we base ourselves on realistic figures 
and conditions, which are facts today,'' said Aigner. ``And not on 
speculations of what the market might give us tomorrow. So an engagement 
with UEFA is risk-free.'' In order to finance the revamped league, 
UEFA said it would investigate the possibility of Pay per View and 
Pay TV. ``We must change our concepts,'' Aigner said. ``The present 
concept has reached saturation as far as possibilities for television. 
TV is already overpaying for rights and we cannot endlessly stretch 
them to pay more and more. ``We must look at other alternatives.'' 
Under any new concept, broadcasting contracts and marketing would 
remain under UEFA control, Aigner said. UEFA remained unwilling to 
allow national leagues to take control of domestic TV rights. ``We 
are firmly of the opinion it should be centralized,'' said Aigner. 
``Any league needs to be centralized, otherwise it's the beginning 
of disintegration.'' Some leagues, however, disagreed. ``It would 
preferable that each team sell its own rights,'' said Franco Carraro, 
president of the Italian league. ``If UEFA insists on a centralized 
sale of rights then it must be transparent, and involve UEFA partners 
as well as the teams. ``Italy is in favor of European competition 
remaining under UEFA's control,'' Carraro concluded. ``But only under 
these conditions.'' Last week, soccer's world ruling body FIFA said 
it was ready to take drastic measures to ensure a spin-off Super League 
never got off the ground. FIFA president Sepp Blatter said FIFA was 
prepared to suspend national associations whose teams defected to 
join a Super League.
