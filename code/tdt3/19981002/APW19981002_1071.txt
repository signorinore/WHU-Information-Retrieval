More than 500 employees at Toronto's main airport went on strike Friday, 
causing only minor delays to flights but predicting disruptions would 
worsen if the walkout continued. The strikers _ including administrative, 
maintenance and computer staff at Pearson International Airport _ 
walked off the job after contract talks broke down Thursday evening. 
Pickets partially blocked service entrances, causing delays of up 
to 45 minutes for arriving airline employees, delivery trucks and 
air traffic controllers. But many passengers at Canada's busiest airport 
didn't notice anything amiss and airline staff reported no significant 
delays in flights. Steve Shaw, vice president of strategic planning 
for the Greater Toronto Airports Authority, said airport managers 
plan to fill in for striking workers. But leaders of the striking 
Union of Canadian Transport Employees doubted management would be 
able to keep the airport running smoothly if the strike continues 
into next week. On average, the three-terminal airport handles 75,000 
passengers a day. It is a major hub for domestic and international 
flights. The employees, whose wages have been frozen for seven years, 
are seeking wage hikes of 15 percent to 23 percent in the first year 
of a new contract, and 5 percent in the next two years. Management 
is offering 8 percent in the first year, and a range of increases 
in the next two years depending on the job category.
