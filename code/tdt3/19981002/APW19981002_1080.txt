As she prepares to defend her No. 1 ranking from the assault of Lindsay 
Davenport, Martina Hingis has to worry about her fitness. After blowing 
a 5-1 lead and a match point in the third set against her fellow Swiss 
teen-ager Patty Schnyder, Hingis retired at 5-5 after suffering cramps 
in the Grand Slam Cup semifinal. ``I have to get into a better shape,'' 
Hingis said. In Sunday's final, Schnyder will meet Venus Williams, 
who swept past Nathalie Tauziat 6-4, 6-0 after coming back from a 
break down in the first set. The first official showdown between the 
two teammates had lasted two hours and 11 minutes by the time Hingis 
retired. Hingis won the first set 7-5, Schnyder took the second, also 
7-5. ``I haven't had enough time to recover since the U.S. Open, but 
I also have to work on my fitness,'' said Hingis, who turned 18 on 
Wednesday. ``If you have certain assets, if you know that you can 
win with these assets without going to your workout studio all the 
time, you tend to neglect your workout studio,'' she said. ``Usually 
I try to have the others players move around the court without moving 
myself too much,'' Hingis said. Schnyder, 19, made Hingis run a lot 
and felt she could have won the match anyway. ``I think I would have 
won those two games, but it's true, she retired and I didn't really 
win it,'' Schnyder said. ``In a regular tournament or in a Grand Slam, 
she would have played those last two games, even at the risk of a 
major injury,'' Schnyder said. ``But this is not a tournament where 
you can win points and she's got a few tournaments coming up where 
she has to defend her No. 1 position.'' Hingis admitted as much. ``Why 
continue? I would have had no chance anyway.'' ``I didn't want to 
suffer more, to get a worse injury,'' she said. ``I still want to 
play the next two tournaments.'' The first is next week in Filderstadt, 
Germany, where Davenport can seize the top ranking. Davenport lost 
her opening match here, to Tauziat. Hingis also suffered cramps in 
a match against Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario in the Fed Cup final two weeks 
ago. Although she won that match, Spain beat Switzerland for the title. 
After winning three of the four Grand Slam tournaments last year (Australian 
Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open) and reaching the final of the French 
Open, Hingis captured only one this year _ the first one in Australia. 
Since then, Hingis has won only three more titles, at Indian Wells, 
Hamburg and Rome, and she lost the U.S. Open final to Davenport, her 
third loss to the American this year. In men's quarterfinals, Andre 
Agassi rallied to beat Petr Korda 4-6, 6-0, 6-1, while Karol Kucera 
ousted Goran Ivanisevic 5-7, 6-4, 8-6. Korda, the Australian Open 
champion, was the only men's Grand Slam winner in the tournament that 
nominally brings together players with best records at the four events. 
Agassi, a wild card, dropped his serve to lose the first set but then 
went on a roll, winning the next eight games. ``I just got the momentum 
and I kept it,'' Agassi said. Korda's double-fault at match point 
was typical of his performance: 16 double-faults and 39 unforced errors. 
While the first set lasted 37 minutes, Agassi needed only 47 for the 
next two. He won his opening match against Cedric Pioline in a tournament-record 
34 minutes. ``I drank too much coffee, I had too much energy,'' he 
said. Although there are no ranking points to be earned at the dlrs 
6.7 million tournament, there is plenty of money to compensate. Schnyder 
and Williams earned dlrs 400,000, and the winner will get dlrs 800,000. 
Hingis got dlrs 200,000, plus a dlrs 100,000 bonus for her Australian 
Open title. Korda, winner here in 1993, received a bye into the quarterfinals 
and for one match made a total of dlrs 300,000 _ including a dlrs 
125,000 bonus for his Australian Open title. Agassi and Kucera, who 
will clash in the semifinals, got dlrs 325,000 each. The men's winner 
will earn dlrs 1.3 million.
