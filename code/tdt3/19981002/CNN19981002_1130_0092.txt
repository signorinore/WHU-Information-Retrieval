What can we expect from this latest document dump on Capitol Hill? 
Brooks Jackson has a preview. The latest batch is roughly 4,000 pafrjs, 
bits edited out this time. Transaction scripts of Linda Tripp Tripp's 
talks with Monica Lewinsky. What it shows depends on who you ask. 
This round of evidence will show to the American people the manipulative 
nature of Ken Starr, of Linda Tripp. You will see a Linda Tripp and 
a Ken Starr who are doing everything they can to create a crime. But 
republican reviewers say the transcripts show Lewinsky saying she 
wouldn't cross the White House for fear of her life. Besides, they 
say, the tapes really aren't that important. Those tapes are diminished 
in evidentiary value because Lewinsky's personal testimony for the 
grand jury is what is critical now. Democrat sources say some material 
will show Ken Starr's report is one-sided. Leaving out material favorable 
to the president. Example, grand jury testimony from Betty Currie, 
saying she started a job search for Lewinsky without being asked. 
On the other hand, republicans say Erskine Bowles, the White House 
chief of staff, testified that the president did ask him to find Lewinsky 
a job inside the White House. Republicans also say that documents 
will show deputy White House counsel Bruce Lindsey stone-walling, 
resisting questions about Vernon Jordan, on grounds of executive privilege, 
even though Jordan had no official position. Did the first lady buy 
a Lame alibi from her husband? She's quoted by White House aide Sidney 
Blumenthal in testimony, according to a republican source saying there 
was nothing dirty about her husband's relationship with Lewinsky, 
that the president was just ministering to a young and troubled woman. 
Whether the latest release turns out to be good fwluz or bad news 
for the president, at the very least it guarantees another round of 
weekend talk shows in which the subject will be Monica Monica, Monica.
