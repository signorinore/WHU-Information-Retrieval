A congressional subcommittee is hearing from HMOs today that are seeking 
higher payments from Medicare patients. The HMOs say they're having 
trouble covering costs and they may have to pull out of certain parts 
of the country. But Medicare officials say the government is providing 
adequate payment to hmos. Last year, Congress cut the annual raises 
for the HMOs to 2%. Those raises had been as high as 10%. About $6 
million Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in HMOs.
