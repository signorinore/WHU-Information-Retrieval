Yugoslavia's Serb leaders are asking U.N. chief Kofi Annan to pay 
a visit to their country. This comes in the wake of an international 
outcry over reports of massacres of ethnic Albanians in the province 
of Kosovo. Yesterday, the U.N. security council issued a statement 
strongly condemning the killings. More than 20,000 people have fled 
Kosovo since fighting flared between Serb-dominated government forces 
and ethnic Albanian rebels. NAto is expected to decide next week whether 
to use military force in Yugoslavia.
