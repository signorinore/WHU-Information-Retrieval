Alaska is facing the country's largest measles outbreak this year. 
Health officials are considering a second vaccination for the state's 
80,000 students. The outbreak started last month at a high school 
in Anchorage. Since then, there have been 18 confirmed cases and 22 
suspected cases. Officials say without a second round of vaccinations, 
it's likely the disease will spread.
