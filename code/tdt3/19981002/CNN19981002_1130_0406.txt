In central Mexico, at least 14 people are dead after torrential rains 
caused a river to burst its banks. Officials are calling on people 
living near rivers, dams and canyons to take precautions because more 
rain is forecast. The heaviest rains in a century have pounded Mexico 
for weeks. Most of the damage has been in the southern part of the 
country where nearly 200 people were killed last month.
