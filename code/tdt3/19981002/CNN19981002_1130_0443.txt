This is Orelon Sidney from the CNN weather center with your "Headline 
News weather update." A cold front moving across the west will help 
generate a chance of rain and possibly some high elevation snows for 
Montana and Idaho, into Wyoming. An area of showers and a few thunderstorms 
are also possible across the midwest and to the Great Lakes as a low 
pressure storm tracks the northeast. Look for rainshowers also across 
southern Florida and a trough of low pressure bringing a chance of 
rain into the pacific northwest. Temperatures in the northeast, the 
Great Lakes and the northern plains stay in the 50s, with a few 40s 
in the forecast for Nebraska and Iowa. Temperatures will be in the 
50s and 60s for the pacific northwest, but warming into the 60s near 
San Francisco. L.A. should be in the 70s, with 80s and 90s covering 
the desert southwest, and 90s expected in southern Texas. The extended 
forecast includes scattered showers in the west, with a few severe 
thunderstorms in the Great Lakes and the gulf coast states on Sunday. 
Severe activity remains through Monday, with showers tapering off 
in the northwest before a new storm system moves in on Tuesday.
