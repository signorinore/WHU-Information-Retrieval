Iranian hardliners are moving forward with efforts to silence publications 
supportive of moderate president kasra naji reports. The authorities 
in Iran this week closed down the biggest circulation newspaper in 
the country, "tous," on charges of insulting the late Ayatollah Khomeini. 
This is part of a new clamp-down on the press by hard-line opponents 
of moderate President Khatami, who's been advocating greater civil 
liberties. Only a couple of months ago, the newspaper, "jam'eh," had 
changed its title to "tous" to escape an earlier closure order. With 
its daring and often libertarian attitude, the new newspaper had become 
the most popular in a matter of months, with a circulation of nearly 
500,000. But the newspaper had powerful critics, too. Last week Iran's 
spiritual leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, criticized unnamed newspapers 
which in his words had "targeted the basic beliefs of young people 
Islam." And the Judiciary, which has been critical of President Khatami's 
government, sprang into action. This editor, who's now in jail, commented 
on the earlier attempt to close down the newspaper. The "jam'eh" newspaper 
followed and advocated the policies of President Khatami both at home 
and abroad. An attack on the newspaper is an attack on President Khatami. 
The action against "tous" has been the first in a series against the 
press in the past ten days or so. All this has led to a serious concern 
among journalists. And President Khatami, who has presided over an 
unprecedented period of press freedom here, has made an appeal to 
hard-liners to allow press freedom to flourish in Iran, arguing freedom 
and religion can work together. President Khatami's appeal has gone 
to the heart of a new debate here. Can an Islamic Iran also be an 
open and democratic society? The answer cannot come soon enough for 
many people here, including journalists, who are increasingly seeing 
their profession as a risky business. Kasra naji, for CNN, Tehran.
