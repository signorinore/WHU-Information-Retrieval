The nation's jobless rate rose to 4.6% last month, up from 4.5% in 
August. The global economic crisis taking its toll on a number of 
fields, inclugds the financial sector. What does this mean for the 
freshly minuted MBA? Bruce advance reports. Despite uncertainty over 
jobs in the finance industry, an MBA is still a valuable job currency, 
especially if it's from one of the top 20 business schools. Within 
a month or two after graduation, 98% of those seeking jobs will have 
found them. Many of them will have had multiple offers, and they have 
on average this past year, a total compensation package for the first 
year of about $130,000. With mergers and market turmoil, the financial 
sector has seen 35,000 layoffs so far this year. But if volatility 
in the markets leads to job uncertainty in brokerage and banking, 
stronger-than-ever demand for MBAs is coming from the consulting industry, 
as companies nationwide look to outsource firms like McKinsey and 
deloitte and touche are grabbing one-third of the top graduating classes. 
There are 475 MBA programs in the U.S., but competition to get into 
the top 20 is fierce. Only about 1 in 12 are accepted. That's "your 
money" bruise Francis, New York.
