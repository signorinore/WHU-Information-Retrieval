Travelers don't need to go too far to experience an African safari 
adventure. An Internet provider is making it possible for subscribers 
to visit south Africa's world famous safari parks by logging onto 
a new web site. Viewers get to see live pictures of animals through 
a closed-circuit video camera mounted in a tree overlooking a waterhole. 
The web site can be accessed on www.africam.com.
