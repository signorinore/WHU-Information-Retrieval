Some 70 masterpieces by painter Vincent Van gogh will go on display 
this weekend at Washington's national gallery of art. The exhibit 
will showcase a rare and comprehensive collection of paintings, drawings 
and letters. Jonathan aiken previews the art pieces and the artist 
behind them. The passion in his work was a need to touch people, to 
bring the visions of his private world directly into our hearts. So 
much of Vincent Van gogh's work is intertwined with his life, that 
it's hard to see his brilliance for the madness that would consume 
him. The romantic story of him being the new artistic genius in his 
lifetime, the death by suicide sometimes get in way of looking clearly 
at his pictures, which are really wonderful. Vincent Van gogh was 
born in 1853, the son of a preacher. He was a teacher and an evangelist. 
He sold art before he decided to make it. His early works were dark, 
Blunt portrayals of peasant life. But when he moved from Holland to 
France in 1886, Van gogh replaced the darkness of those early efforts 
with powerful brush strokes and bold, contrasting colors. Those are 
the paintings most people come to see, but they're only some of the 
70 works brought to America while the Van gogh museum in Amsterdam 
undergoes renovation. The very fact there is a museum in his name, 
that his work draws sell-out crowds and commands astronomical prices, 
proves that Van gogh's passion was not misplaced, that his need to 
communicate the intensity with which he saw life, equals our need 
to be touched by his soul. I like to think that it has to do with 
the pictures themselves. It has to do with the combination of color. 
If I had to put in one sentence with the way he is able to uncover 
the extraordinary which lies behind the ordinary surfaces of everyday 
life. Jonathan aiken for CNN, Washington.
