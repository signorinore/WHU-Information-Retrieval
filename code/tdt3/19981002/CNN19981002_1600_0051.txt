new details are out about president clinton's relationship with monica 
lewinsky. the house judiciary committee has released the last major 
batch of evidence collected by ken starr in his investigation. the 
4,600 pages made public today include transcripts of linda tripp's 
secret tape recordings of her conversations with lewinsky. testimony 
by most of the major witnesses who appeared before the grand jury 
is also included. while this new material doesn't contain the controversial 
details of previously released documents, it does add color to the 
contacts between tripp and lewinsky. at one point, monica lewinsky 
suggests to linda tripp she should go forward and just simply deny 
it, since monica lewinsky would deny it. the president would deny 
it. there would be no way anyone could prove that lewinsky and the 
president did, in fact, have a sexual relationship. but linda tripp 
made the point that she couldn't live with herself. she said at one 
point, i have essentially bastardized my entire guts, and i will have, 
i promise you, if i do this, monica, it will kill me inside. i'll 
do it. if i do it, it's not for him, but i have no protection, nobody 
overseeing me. and monica then said, well, i have no one protecting 
me either. and linda trip said, yes, you do and that's vernon jordan, 
the president's pal. where lewinsky is giving advice to tripp. the 
advice is how tripp should handle questions in the paula jones deposition, 
and lewinsky is telling tripp how she can get around saying that she 
has heard from monica lewinsky, that lewinsky and the president had 
sex. this is lewinsky to tripp -- "you could say, i don't think so." 
lewinsky goes on, "i think that's something i'd remember, and i don't 
recall." another suggestion from lewinsky. "i don't recall. you can 
say, "i don't recall that." tripp responds, "uh-huh." lewinsky says, 
see there, you haven't said no. this is lewinsky coaching tripp on 
how to perform in the paula jones deposition. candy crowley reports.
