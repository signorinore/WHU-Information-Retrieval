house democrats have offered an alternative proposal to the republicans' 
set of impeachment procedures. republicans favor no time constraints 
and no limit on subject matter in the proceedings. but democrats want 
to limit the investigation to the lewinsky case. they also propose 
a time limit of six weeks, which would end the inquiry around thanksgiving. 
democrats have also provided the option of censure as an alternative 
to drawing up the articles of impeachment. we have assembled an alternative 
that we think is fair, that we think is balanced, and the public interest 
requires no less. this alternative also is prompt. and we can assure 
that within a reasonable period of time we can evaluate thoroughly 
and completely the allegations that are contained in the referral 
of the independent counsel, render a fair decision thereon, have the 
committee report those decisions to the house of representatives, 
and have the entire process, including committee consideration, and 
also consideration by the house of representatives completed by the 
25th of november. republicans have said they will not compromise their 
proposal, and it should pass by an overwhelming majority. but congressman 
bill mccollum says there are still a lot of issues to be resolved. 
you're going to have a very full debate, in the open, in the public, 
not in a closed session. i think the sticking points, if there are 
any, are simply over the procedures, the process at the moment. ultimately 
we have to resolve whether or not the president of the united states 
committed crimes that are high crimes and misdemeanors that would 
warrant impeachment or not. whether or not there is enough evidence 
to go forward with hearings. and if we do with hearings whether we 
have enough evidence that would warrant articles of impeachment.
