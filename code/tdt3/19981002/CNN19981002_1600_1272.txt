the indians and red sox are squaring off in game three of their best-of-five 
series which is even at one apiece. charles nagy, who is 7-1 lifetime 
against boston, opened up opposite fellow 15-game winner, bret saberhagen. 
later tonight, the rangers hope aaron sele can avoid a sweep by a 
yankees team that will have 20-game winner david cone on the hill. 
it's a do-or-die game. there's no reason to reach back and draw on 
anything. if you can't draw from the excitement of a game three like 
this, then you shouldn't be out there pitching. you know, i expect 
them to be a little more relaxed, actually. you know, i expect them 
to be ready to play. you know, this is -- this is a tough game. i 
knew going in this series that this would be maybe the toughest game 
for a starting pitcher. and it's kind of a swing game of the series, 
it's the first one on the road against a team that's very powerful 
and plays well on their home park. a day after jim leyland stepped 
down, the marlins have a new manager. don bulls moves up from vice 
president of player development. he guided the team to a 40-35 record 
on an interim basis in 1996 before leyland w as hired.
