fans of melissa joan hart can get a double dose of the spell-binding 
actress. she's the star of the television series "sabrina, the teenage 
witch." and she will conjure up that role in a new made-for-tv movie. 
sherri sylvester reports. melissa joan hart agreed to play sabrina 
during her hiatus on one condition. that condition is the title of 
the telefilm, "sabrina goes to rome." you find her first in a cab 
with a locket and a letter from her dad saying, "this is your mission. 
you have two weeks to try and open this locket. it belonged to my 
aunt who i didn't know." sophia, who i play also in the movie. salem 
the talking cat is along for the ride. hart's real-life boyfriend 
made the trip and plays travis. her mother serves as executive producer 
of the disney sunday movie which employs lots of practical magic. 
she goes all around rome. she pops in and out of paintings. statues 
come alive. sabrina actually jumps into a painting, goes back to the 
renaissance meets her aunt -- even though hart plays both characters, 
that's the back of her mom's head in these over-the-shoulder shots. 
you're a witch. how wonderful. they should. back home, it's back to 
school for "sabrina, the teenage witch." the show is in its third 
season, and its value to abc is not kid's stuff. the series has been 
renewed until 2000. teens are just kids wanting to be adults, so you 
have to play them as -- it's a little bit difficult, a little tricky 
because they have all this energy and all these crazy hormones going 
on. you've got to make it like they're trying to be mature but they're 
not. no longer a teen herself, hart and her mom run their own production 
company heartbreak films, and are working on an animated prequel for 
upn. they hold weekly pitch meetings and may expand beyond the sabrina 
franchise. i kind of grew up faster than a lot of kids, i guess. i 
still have a few issues to work out with people my own age. i really 
don't know how to communicate with people my own age. i'm okay with 
adults. it's difficult with people around 20. but for melissa joan 
hart, this may be the magic hour. sherri sylvester, cnn, los angeles.
