The republican majority on the house Judiciary committee is trying 
to figure out how to proceed with an expected impeachment inquiry 
against President Clinton. Republicans favor an inquiry with no limits 
on the subject matter or time. Democrats are asking that the investigation 
be limited to the Monica Lewinsky matter. They want to end the inquiry 
around Thanksgiving. And they want to provide an option for censure 
rather than impeachment. The committee may vote Monday on exactly 
how to proceed.
