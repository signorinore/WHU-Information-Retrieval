President Clinton says a congressional delay in approving money for 
the international monetary fund is inexcusable. The IMF wants $18 
billion from the United States to replace money spent bailing out 
international financial institutions. Some members of Congress disapprove 
of the IMF's policies. Mr. Clinton says the United States must respond 
to what he calls the worst global financial crisis in 50 years. He 
will attend a summit of financial managers and central bankers from 
22 countries on Monday in Washington. I am pleased that on short notice, 
secretary Rubin and chairman Greenspan have arranged the meeting of 
finance ministers and central bankers from the major industrialized 
nations and the key emerging markets for next Monday here in Washington. 
I will personally participate in their deliberations. The following 
day, I will address the world bank and the international monetary 
fund to underscore the urgency of quick action and the need for long-term 
reform of the international financial system. In order to stop the 
spread of financial problems, Mr. Clinton says he will encourage U.S. 
businesses to continue exporting and investing in emerging markets.
