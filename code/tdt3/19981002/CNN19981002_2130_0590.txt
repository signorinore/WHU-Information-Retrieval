The United States has issued an ultimatum to Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic. The Clinton administration said today that unless he meets 
all U.N. demands to stop an assault on ethnic Albanians, NATO will 
strike Serb forces in Kosovo within two weeks. The U.N. is demanding 
Milosevic allow 275,000 refugees in Kosovo to return to their villages 
and let humanitarian groups into the area to help them.
