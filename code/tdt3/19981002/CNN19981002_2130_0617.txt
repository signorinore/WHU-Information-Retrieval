Researchers at M.I.T. have come up with a way to help children turn 
sounds into music. Ann Kellan has more in this edition of "tech trends." 
ba ba ba ba a familiar sight -- children singing. It's how many kids 
get their first taste of music before they're old enough to play the 
piano or the violin. But if you are tired of the same old song, welcome 
to the computer age. Some researchers at the M.I.T. media lab are 
trying to shake up the way kids make music. Who can resist rattles. 
Now, they're digital. So, this is something light and simple for kids 
to play. Now, they don't have to understand what's going on in there, 
just pick it up and make sound. What's going on in there, anyway? 
So it's going through the shaking. yes. The shaking goes through a 
wire and to a digitizer which is underneath and goes into the computer. 
The rattles are high-tech and fun for all ages. But there's more. 
Gan also took the plunge into -- a musical playpen? What is a musical 
playpen? Look. Watch. According to gan, it's all about good vibration. 
Sensors in the balls pick up movement. As you swim around, like you 
are swimming in water, and your movement will be interpreted by the 
computer, and that will create the music that you hearing right now, 
for example. Remember how much fun it is to squish jello between your 
fingers? Well, these M.I.T. researchers have come up with a way to 
do it that not only won't get kids in trouble. Now squeezing makes 
music. They're called squeezables. We tried many different kinds of 
materials like foam and soft plastic, and we reached to the conclusion 
that jell-O is the most responsive one. So how does jell-O make music? 
Well, we have the sensors, which is a false pressure sensor. So, it 
give you continuous control. When I squeeze the jell-O, the jell-O 
squeezes the pressure sensors. M.I.T. researchers say it will be at 
least a year before any of these children will be able to rock, rattle 
or roll with the digital toys. In the meantime, most kids find a way 
to have a good time making music. Ann Kellan, CNN, Cambridge, Massachusetts.
