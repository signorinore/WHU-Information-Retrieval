Duane Walker, "Headline Sports." First stop is in the American league 
where the Yankees and rangers are playing. The Bronx bombers lead 
that series 2-0 and can wrap things up tonight. Darryl Strawberry 
made his first public appearance. It is a very difficult time. But 
you have to deal with this. I just -- I really don't know what to 
say at this point. Earlier the Indians bolted to a lead over Boston 
after a 4-3 victory. All four of the tribes' runs came off of homers. 
Jim thome and Kenny Lofton provided two. Charles nagy held six solid 
innings for Cleveland. Manager Bruce bochy has changed his pitching 
rotation. Kevin brown will get the nod and start in game three Saturday 
night. The Florida Marlins have found a new manager to replace Jim 
leyland. It will be John Bowles.
