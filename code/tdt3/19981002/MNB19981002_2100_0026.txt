First, tonight, journalists are pouring over thousands of pages of 
documents dumped on the public by the house Judiciary committee. There 
seems to be evidence supporting both sides in this. For the first 
time we get to read what was said on hours of once-secret tapes. NBC 
news has been going over the evidence all day. We have two reports 
to begin with this evening. Here to start us off from Washington, 
Lisa Myers. The 20 hours of taped transcripts and thousands of pages 
of documents all rich in detail reveal that Lewinsky and her mother 
both feared White House retaliation last January as her relationship 
with the president was in danger of becoming known. Some of the most 
dramatic exchanges came as Lewinsky lunched with Linda Tripp at this 
Virginia hotel, not knowing her friend had been wired at Ken Starr's 
request by the F.B.I an at times tearful Lewinsky tells Tripp, I would 
not cross these people. Monica tells Tripp if she didn't already plan 
to deny her affair with the president under oath, her mother would 
make her. And she warns trip and coaches her on the fine art of lying 
under oath -- "I might have, but I don't remember," that's the phrase 
my lawyer told me. Lewinsky has since testified that was not true, 
that the president never told her to lie. Tripp's response, that Monica 
is lying now to protect the president from more serious legal charges. 
Most of the tapes involve much more personal matters and reveal a 
sometimes actual ultwus relationship between the two -- tumultuous 
relationship between the two women. It certainly dramatically impacts 
everyone's lives. Monica tells Linda she reminds her of her mother, 
the only person on earth Monica truferts. Linda tries to build up 
Monica's self-esteem even as she secretly tapes conversations. The 
White House says the reports failed to include critical facts about 
Tripp. Ms. Tripp's repeated attempts to encourage behavior that the 
independent counsel later suggests is central to his case raise disturbing 
questions about this entire affair. Still, Lewinsky refers to the 
president sonch as the creep, calls him the biggest little liar she's 
ever met, but says she can't get him out of her hearment
