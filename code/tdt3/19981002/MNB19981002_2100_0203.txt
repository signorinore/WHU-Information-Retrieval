This is Gwen Ifill on Capitol Hill. The new evidence reveals a president 
intent on keeping secrets. But the details also show that the Lewinsky 
relationship was an open secret on the White House grounds where, 
one secret service agent testified, he bet another officer on how 
fast the president would beat a path to the oval office to see the 
woman he described as "the president's miss trs. kts." In his grand 
jury testimony, Washington superlawyer Vernon Jordan says he "didn't 
want Monica to tell a a a a about her relationship with the president," 
but he said he agrees with the president that sexual relations means 
sexual intercourse only, a key part of Mr. Clinton's defense against 
perjury. Jordan also flatly denies he helped Lewinsky get a job in 
exchange for her silence. His testimony -- absolutely, unequivocally, 
indubitably. A a a S presidential secretary Betty Currie says she 
had a gut feeling that Lewinsky's very serious crush on the president 
had gone too far but after the story breaks, it is Currie who retrieves 
the president's gifts to Lewinsky. But the closest person to the president, 
the first lady, apparently suspected nothing. Sidney Blumenthal testified 
Hillary thought her husband's relationship with Lewinsky involved 
only "ministry of a troubled person." I don't think there's any choice 
but that you should vote to continue this inquiry. If the president 
were to be impeached, we could have 20 years of recriminations, you 
staged a coup D'etat, overturned the election unfairly. Monday the 
house Judiciary committee meets to begin considering impeachment hearings. 
Democrats say a Lesser punishment is in order, republicans seem in 
no mood to listen.
