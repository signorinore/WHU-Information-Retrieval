Much worry around these days about global financial markets and Wall 
Street but today the stock market bounced back a bit, regaining some 
ground after a three of this day global sell-off this week. The Dow 
ended the day up 152 points, closing 7787. For the entire week, the 
Dow lost 3% of its entire value. NASDAQ closed slightly higher today 
to end at just under 1615.
