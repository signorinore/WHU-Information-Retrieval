Word arrived this morning that the singing cowboy, Gene autry, who 
lived the American dream, had died after a long illness. His smooth 
voice and charmlet led him to a prolific career. He made 100 films, 
over 600 films, including some American classics -- Rudolph the red-nosed 
reindeer and his signature, "back in the saddle again." Long-time 
owner of the California Angels, he owned a lot of broadcasting properties 
as well. Never saw his beloved team make the world series. Gene autry 
dead tonight, he was 1 years old.
