We'll begin tonight with the high anxieties in the world of high finance. 
After the president's announcement, the Dow went up more than 150 
points, and the NASDAQ was up about 2 3/4. For the week, the Dow was 
down more than 244 points. NASDAQ, down more than 128. Now the question 
is, can the U.S. ride to the rescue of the world? NBC's David Bloom 
is at the White House tonight. David. Tom, the president said today 
the world is facing its "most serious financial challenge in 50 years." 
And he said the U.S. must take aggressive action now to avert a "global 
financial slowdown." One of his top economists said this is about 
safeguarding American jobs, savings and national security. Today President 
Clinton proposed that the world's richest nations provide an emergency 
line of credit to the most vulnerable ones -- tens of billions of 
dollars to try to lead the world "back away from this financial precipice." 
We don't have to have a worldwide recession if those of us that enjoy 
growth will take the initiative and move now. But we cannot afford 
to dally around here. Over the past year, the economic crisis that 
began in southeast Asia has spread like a plague -- from Japan, its 
worst depression since world war II, to Russia, in economic free fall. 
Now Latin America is threatened. And the fear is that the still-healthy 
U.S. economy could be next. The world's in a very dangerous situation 
right now. American export jobs are being lost and there is some evidence 
that U.S. bavgs are lending less money here at home. Still secretary 
treser Robert Rubin predicted solid economic growth even as the administration 
tries unsuccessfulfully to stop the global crisis from spreading. 
Today President Clinton argued that Congress is largely to blame for 
refusing to pay America's $18 billion obligation to the international 
monetary fund, money used to bail out countries ns financial trouble. 
I have been asking for this nearly a year now. The crisis overseas 
is continuing to intensify. This is inexcusable and we need the money 
now. House republicans argue that the IMF just throws good money after 
all. They argue if the U.S. doesn't bony up, others will not either 
and valuable export moneys will be lost. We will take a close look 
at the condition of the American economy.
