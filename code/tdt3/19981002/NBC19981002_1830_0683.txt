2 1/2 months ago, the whole country watched live pictures of a cruise 
ship full of summer vacationers as it burned off the south Florida 
coast. At the time, there were lots of questions about how the fire 
got so out of hand. Tonight, the coast guard has released its tapes 
of the the radio transmissions from that day. Here's NBC's Robert 
Hager. The radio calls reveal that, at first, the "ecstasy's" crew 
attempts to fight the fire without help -- doesn't even call the coast 
guard. But other boats nearby know the situation is serious and sound 
an alarm through the static -- But when the coast guard calls the 
"ecstasy," the cruise ship plays down the trouble. 15 long minutes 
go by before captain changes his mind and finally acknowledges the 
"ecstasy" needs help, quickly. Fortunately, fireboats launch even 
before the captain asks for help. Now, pour water on the flames and 
report back -- The ship limps back to port safely. Today, ten weeks 
later, investigators blame the fire on sparks from a welder's torch 
but still want to know why the cruise ship didn't ask sooner for help. 
Robert Hager, NBC news, Washington.
