NBC news "in depth" -- tonight, America's roaring economy. It has 
been growing by leaps and bounds for almost a decade. But is there 
danger ahead? Just look at where the stock market has been this year 
-- the Dow Jones industrial average peaked on July 17th of this year, 
closing way over the 9000 Mark. Tonight, NBC's chief financial correspondent 
Mike Jensen with our "nightly question" -- In Seattle today, 1,100 
layoffs at Boeing -- a total of 28,000 jobs lost by the end of next 
year. In Palo alto, California, today, Hewlett-Packard offers buyouts 
to 2,500 workers. And there's more to come. In New York, even the 
Rochester big & tall shop is feeling the effect of the chaos overseas. 
We have certainly seen a slowdown in the amount of customers coming 
to us to shop from both Russia, Brazil and other countries in south 
America. What's going on? Across the country, people are worried about 
the economy -- from executive towers, to trading floors, to retail 
stores. A new survey says consumer confidence has been falling steadily 
since June. That means fewer people hired. The government, announcing 
today that the unemployment rate in September rose to 4.6% -- the 
smallest gain in almost three years. Also making people nervous -- 
Wall Street. Stocks, plunging 13% in the last three months. August 
was the first time in almost a decade that investors took more money 
out of stock funds than they put in. And those who didn't are thinking 
about it. Well, as a retiree, I'm worried that since my main income 
is coming from investments, that perhaps I don't have the right balance 
by being largely in the stock market. Why is this happening now? Because 
of events halfway around the world -- where economies are in turmoil, 
recession, even depression. Bad news for America, which depends on 
exports for 12% of its economy. In Seattle -- tuna bound for Japan, 
still sitting on boats. American plants that normally churn out products 
for export, slowing down. The overall level of manufacturing, down 
a fourth straight month. So does all this mean we're headed for a 
recession, where the American economy would actually shrink? Most 
experts say probably not -- that while the slowdown in America is 
painful, our seven-year expansion is likely to keep going -- only 
at a much slower pace. But the economists say it's a close call -- 
that there's now a 30% to 40% chance that the economic slowdown will 
turn into a full-fledged recession. And they say that's exactly why 
it's so urgent for the U.S. to do whatever it can to bail out the 
rest of the world. Mike Jensen, NBC news, New York.
