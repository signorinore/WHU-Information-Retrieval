Tonight a still different kind of threat in chug. In Chicago, an environmental 
threat of another kind -- harmless-looking bugs that can cause major 
damage. NBC's Jim Avila tonight. Government inspectors on alert for 
a dangerous six-legged stowaway. The Asian long-horned beetle, aboard 
Chinese freighters. This is classic beetle damage. No natural enemies, 
unaffected by pesticides and jaws that penetrate deep into mature 
trees, this beetle is chewing majestic maples, elms and chestnuts 
to death. The inside of the tree is totally full of holes of this 
nature and size. In Chicago, agriculture inspector Joe Schaffer is 
in charge of what the city calls a full-blown crisis. This tree is 
in the last stages of life. Each female beetle lays up to 80 eggs. 
80 holes just like that one. By spring, this peaceful parkway oasis 
will be gone. Left behind, another sun-baked, vacant lot. The 25-year-old 
maple trees will be chipped and burned. To the distress of Chicago's 
forestry chief, that's the only way to kill the Asian beetle. Kill 
the tree it's attacking, chip it into small pieces and burn the wood 
and the bug. It's easy for a tree to die. But it's not easy to establish 
a tree and have them mature to an urban forest. It's devastating. 
How did the bugs get here? Hitchhikers on wooden crates from China, 
discarded in the rear of this hardware business. The frustrating part, 
inspectors say the Chinese exporters know the beetles are infecting 
their crates, but intentionally hide the evidence. This was on the 
floor side of the crate which, is not visible for inspection. It's 
a very ingenious way to try and circumvent our regulations. The potential 
danger is enormous. At risk -- lumber and maple sugar industries. 
The only other known infestations, two in New York destroyed one-third 
of the mature trees in the quarantined area. The first Chicago beetle 
was found in Kathy Luca's backyard. The whole community is going to 
be Bare for many years without trees. The agriculture department says 
it doesn't have enough inspectors and is depending on the rest of 
America to search for the telltale holes of the Asian long-horned 
beetle, before another neighborhood loses 25 years of backyard history.
