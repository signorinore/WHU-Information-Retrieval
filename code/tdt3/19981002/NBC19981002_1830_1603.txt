He started out in Texas as a singing cowboy. And when he died today 
at the age of 91, Gene autry was worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
He had been one of the country's most popular film stars. One of his 
records remains one of the all-time best-Sellers. And he owned his 
own baseball team. If that isn't the American dream, what is? NBC's 
George Lewis. I'm back in the saddle again out where a friend is a 
friend He could fight. He could shoot. He could ride and he could 
sing. And he did it in 97 western movies from the '30s to the '50s. 
Your mother was raised way down in old Texas And his young fans rarely 
questioned why his singing voice never bobbled as he bounced along 
the trail on his great horse, champion. One producer criticized autry's 
acting and said he had no future in Hollywood. Even after he became 
a star, autry had no illusions about his talent. I always considered 
myself as a personality more than as an actor. But as a recording 
artist, autry sold 100 million records in his lifetime, including 
10 million copies of this Christmas classic -- Rudolph the red-nosed 
reindeer had a very shiny nose In the '50s, he retired from films 
to become a businessman, owning radio and TV stations, a Palm Springs 
hotel and the California Angels baseball team. His one big disappointment 
was that his Angels never made it to the world series. But his investments 
earned him hundreds of millions -- far more than he ever got from 
movies or records. It was quite a ride for a guy who started out with 
a $5 mail-order guitar. When the sun's in the west and the last call 
is sounded we'll rest on the sunset trail George Lewis, NBC news, 
Los Angeles. So when willy Nelson sings, momma, don't let your babies 
grow up to be Cowboys, don't believe him.
