In a couple of weeks, the Culinary Institute of America will hold 
its largest fund-raising event of the year, a $500-a-plate dinner 
that attracts New York City's premier chefs and restaurateurs. But 
a sudden uproar over the affair's guest of honor may have organizers 
choosing bicarbonate of soda as their evening's aperitif. The intended 
honoree is Ronald Magruder, a trustee for the institute and president 
of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, the restaurant chain based in 
Lebanon, Tenn. But several city officials, including City Comptroller 
Alan Hevesi, say that Cracker Barrel has a history of discriminating 
against gay people, and they say the institute should not honor Magruder. 
At the heart of the dispute is a decision by Cracker Barrel in early 
1991 to dismiss all gay employees because their life style was inconsistent 
with the ``perceived values of our customer base.'' The company rescinded 
the order in the firestorm that quickly followed, but not before more 
than a dozen employees were fired. Magruder was not working for Cracker 
Barrel at the time of the directive, but that did not temper the outrage 
of Hevesi and three gay officials from Manhattan, Assemblywoman Deborah 
Glick and Thomas Duane and Margarita Lopez of the City Council. ``What's 
outrageous about the culinary institute's program and fund-raising 
is to honor the president of a company that is so blatantly bigoted,'' 
Hevesi said. ``This isn't subtle bigotry; this was their policy.'' 
Hevesi is custodian of the city's five employee pension funds, which 
own $6.8 million in Cracker Barrel stock, but the officials said that 
divesting the city of it would be too complicated. Besides, they said, 
they would rather hold onto the shares so that city officials can 
attend shareholder meetings and raise the issue. Susan Dumont-Bengston, 
a spokeswoman for the institute, which is based in Hyde Park., N.Y., 
said on Thursday afternoon that it was proceeding with plans to honor 
Magruder. ``We chose him for all the good reasons for why you honor 
an individual: support, commitment, service.'' She also pointed out 
that Magruder and his wife, Elizabeth, have established a scholarship 
at the school for disadvantaged students, ``which includes minorities.'' 
Cracker Barrel officials issued a statement saying that the company 
based its hiring policies ``solely on experience, aptitude and abilities.'' 
The statement continued, ``We do not tolerate discrimination of any 
kind toward any individual or group.'' The Cracker Barrel chain has 
about 300 locations offering grits and country fried steak in its 
restaurants and maple syrup and pecan logs in the adjacent country 
stores. The current furor over Cracker Barrel began when the culinary 
institute decided to honor Magruder and sent a solicitation letter 
for the dinner to Ms. Glick. Instead of buying a $500 ticket, she 
and Hevesi sent a letter on Sept. 9 to the institute's president, 
Ferdinand Metz, urging him to reconsider the choice of Magruder. When 
they received a letter that they said dodged the issue, they decided 
to go public. ``It is an insult to lesbians and gays in New York to 
have this occur here in our city and to have an institution like the 
culinary institute do this,'' Ms. Glick said, adding, ``We urge people 
not to attend this dinner, not to support the culinary institute in 
their embracing of a discriminatory and bigoted employer.'' A spokeswoman 
for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said that the mayor had not been invited 
to the dinner. She declined to discuss specifically the matters raised 
by Hevesi, but said that Giuliani had been ``very consistent in his 
opposition to any kind of discrimination.'' The fury of the elected 
officials caught the culinary institute by surprise. But in a statement 
on Thursday, it said, ``We understand that this issue, raised by Mr. 
Hevesi as an investors' representative, is one of corporate governance 
and should be pursued through appropriate channels other than the 
Culinary Institute of America.''
