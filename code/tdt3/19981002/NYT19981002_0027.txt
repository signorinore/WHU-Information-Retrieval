At one point, the Chicago Cubs were two outs from victory. But when 
Thursday night's game ended, they were one loss from elimination. 
Thanks to a dramatic home run by Javy Lopez, a game-winning hit by 
Chipper Jones, and critical mistakes by the Cubs, the Atlanta Braves 
have grabbed a commanding 2-0 lead in their three-of-five-game playoff 
series. With one out in the bottom of the ninth inning, and the Braves 
trailing, 1-0, Lopez hit a towering solo home run to left field that 
sent the game into extra innings. Then in the bottom of the 10th inning, 
a one-out single by Jones scored Walt Weiss from second base, giving 
Atlanta a thrilling 2-1 victory at Turner Field. The Cubs had a hard 
time figuring out how they had let the game slip away. ``The toughest 
loss of the year,'' said Mickey Morandini, the Cubs' second baseman. 
``It hurts. But this thing isn't over.'' It was an emotional victory 
for the Braves, and a deflating loss for the Cubs, who were on the 
verge of tying the series, riding a masterly pitching performance 
by Kevin Tapani. But it all fell apart for the Cubs after Lopez hit 
one of the biggest home runs of his career, a long drive over the 
left-field fence that sent the Turner Field record crowd of 51,713 
into a frenzy. Things continued to go badly for the Cubs in the top 
of the 10th inning, when they squandered an opportunity to take the 
lead. A walk to Glenallen Hill, a sacrifice by Gary Gaetti, an intentional 
walk to Morandini, and a steal of third base by Hill gave Chicago 
runners at the corners with one out. But on a 3-2 count, Jeff Blauser 
struck out, and it turned into an inning-ending double play when Lopez 
threw out Morandini at second base. Morandini threw down his helmet 
in disgust, arguing that he was safe. Jim Riggleman, the Cubs' manager, 
said that Morandini was running so that the Cubs would avoid grounding 
into a double play. ``If he doesn't go, and we hit the ball on the 
ground, we hit into a double play and the inning is over anyway,'' 
Riggleman said. ``With a left-hander on the mound, it's tough to get 
a good jump, and Mick didn't get a good jump. Mick didn't think the 
tag was ever made.'' Then the Braves ended the game in the bottom 
half of the 10th inning, scoring the winning run against Terry Mulholland, 
who took over from Tapani, who allowed five hits in nine innings, 
with six strikeouts and three walks. Weiss started the rally by walking 
with one out. Then the Cubs made another mistake. Tony Graffanino 
bunted down the first-base line, and Mulholland hustled to cover first 
base. But Morandini had also come over to cover first, and as Mulholland 
grabbed the toss from first baseman Mark Grace, Mulholland missed 
the bag as he tried to maneuver around Morandini. Graffanino was safe, 
putting runners on first and second base with one out. Then came the 
winning hit from Jones, a line drive to left field that easily scored 
Weiss. ``I hit a cutter inside,'' said Jones, who struck out in his 
first three at-bats against Tapani. ``Mulholland is a guy whose bread 
and butter is to saw you off inside.'' As Jones ran down the first-base 
line, he used body English, trying to coax the ball to stay fair. 
``I couldn't even tell you what I was doing,'' he said. ``I saw the 
ball going into the outfield, and I knew the fielder wasn't going 
to catch it. It was just a matter of fair or foul. I was doing a little 
bit of Carlton Fisk, and a little bit of Dave Henderson.'' The Braves 
ran onto the field in celebration. The Cubs walked off the field dejectedly. 
They will try to keep their season alive in Game 3, Saturday night 
at Wrigley Field. Riggleman had his closer, Rod Beck, ready to pitch 
when Lopez hit his game-tying homer, but the Cubs' manager decided 
to stay with Tapani. ``It was a very tough decision,'' said Riggleman 
of allowing Tapani to pitch the ninth inning. ``When you got a guy 
like Beck, it's a great temptation to turn it over to him. I just 
felt that Tap was doing a good job. It's one of those manager's calls. 
The way I chose didn't work out, and I feel terrible for Tap and the 
club that it didn't.'' Most of the game was a pitching duel between 
Tapani and Tom Glavine, Atlanta's starter, who went seven innings 
and allowed just three hits while striking out eight. Chicago's run 
off Glavine, who did not allow a hit through five innings, came in 
the sixth. Morandini and Scott Servais singled, then Tapani moved 
the runners up with a sacrifice. Lance Johnson's ground ball to second 
base scored Morandini. Until Lopez's home run, it looked as if that 
run would be enough for the Cubs and Tapani. But it wasn't. ``It's 
a shame we didn't get this win, because Kevin pitched a great game,'' 
Grace said. ``But I've learned in this game you have to get 27 outs 
to win. We didn't finish the job. Now we have to bounce back.''
