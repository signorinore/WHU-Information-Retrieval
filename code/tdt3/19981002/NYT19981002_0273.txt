Small investors who cannot find lawyers to handle their Wall Street 
grievances may now find counsel at a small but growing number of law 
school clinics. So far, only four law schools have such clinics, with 
a fifth set to open one in January. But if the idea catches on, advocates 
say, the odds faced by lawyerless investors in securities arbitration, 
which is mandatory in most customer-broker disputes, could be greatly 
improved. Investors in general fared better in their fights with their 
brokers in 1997 than they have in any year since at least 1980, according 
to statistics released in July by the Securities Industry Conference 
on Arbitration, a national advisory panel that monitors the arbitration 
process. The panel's survey showed that investors won almost 57 percent 
of the arbitration cases decided last year, up from 52 percent in 
1996. But the success rate has been substantially less impressive 
in recent years for investors whose claims were too small to attract 
the help of a lawyer, according to a study early last year by the 
Securities Arbitration Commentator, a journal that tracks arbitration 
awards. Among investors with claims of less than $10,000, those who 
appeared pro se _ that is, representing themselves _ won less than 
45 percent of their cases in 1996. And when they did win, they recovered 
a smaller percentage of their losses, the survey showed. The percentage 
recovered was even more meager in pro se cases involving claims of 
$10,000 to $25,000. The first clinic opened in November 1997 at Pace 
University Law School in White Plains, N.Y. This fall, clinics have 
opened at Fordham University in Manhattan, Brooklyn Law School and 
the University at Buffalo Law School. Stetson University College of 
Law in St. Petersburg, Fla., is set to open its clinic in January. 
Professor Pamela Rogers Chepiga is getting Fordham's clinic up and 
running, with the support of Constantine N. Katsoris, a Fordham law 
professor who served for 20 years on the Securities Industry Conference 
on Arbitration. Professor Chepiga said interest among students was 
so strong that she had to turn many away after filling the six openings. 
Now she is looking for cases to keep the students busy. The most promising 
source of cases for the clinics are referrals from local lawyers or 
bar associations. Allen J. Charne, executive director of legal referral 
services for the New York City bar association, applauded the arbitration 
clinic initiative. ``Our members have been suggesting something like 
this for years,'' he said. One query at Fordham came from ``a working 
woman of limited means'' whose $14,000 nest egg had shrunk to $4,000 
_ and for this, she paid $13,000 in commissions, Professor Chepiga 
said. ``To her, that loss can be a very significant part of her savings,'' 
the professor said. Romaine Gardner, the professor overseeing the 
Brooklyn clinic, said that students benefit from the experience and 
that investors need the help. ``But the clinics are really beneficial 
to everybody, including the brokerage firms,'' he added. ``It is often 
difficult to defend a case when it is being handled pro se, as opposed 
to one that is well presented.'' Investors are generally screened 
for hardship at the clinics so millionaires who can't find a lawyer 
willing to take their case need not apply. The Legal Referral Service 
of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York can provide 
referral information for any New York area clinic at (212) 626-7373. 
The clinics' direct phone numbers are: Fordham, (212) 636-7231; Pace, 
(914) 422-4333 (ask for the securities arbitration clinic), and the 
University at Buffalo, (716) 645-2167.
