Congress is about to make it a whole lot harder for many Americans 
to walk away from their debts. And, depending on whom you talk to, 
that will either throw untold numbers of people into lifelong economic 
bondage in the next recession or teach them a much-needed lesson in 
financial responsibility. Under current law, people who get in over 
their heads can get a fresh start by filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, 
wiping out all their debts except taxes, mortgages, student loans, 
child support, alimony and, in some cases, loans on a car needed to 
get to work. Such filings are made by hundreds of thousands of people 
each year. But under legislation expected to be passed soon by Congress 
_ it is unclear if President Clinton will sign it _ debtors would 
have to pay back up to 30 percent of their credit card bills. Such 
a requirement would save the credit card industry an estimated $4 
billion or more a year. ``People who can afford to pay should not 
be able to not pay,'' said Tom Layman, chief economist for Visa, the 
big credit card organization. He calls the current law ``welfare on 
demand'' for borrowers. Many financial specialists agree that it has 
become too easy for debtors to just say no to their creditors. Dawn 
Sims-Munoz, a counselor for the Consumer Credit Counseling Service 
in Phoenix who herself filed for bankruptcy 12 years ago to wipe out 
nearly $4,000 in medical bills and other costs, urges her clients 
to go down the repayment path. And she is all for the proposed changes. 
``They're going to teach many people responsibility, whether they 
want it or not,'' Ms. Sims-Munoz said. But critics say the proposed 
overhaul would create a nightmare for some families when bankruptcies 
start mounting in the next recession from their already torrid pace. 
The House version of the legislation would require bankruptcy filers 
who earn more than the median income _ $17,900 for a single person, 
$51,000 for a family of four _ to pay back a portion of their credit 
card debts by going into Chapter 13 bankruptcy, under which debtors 
must try to repay their creditors. The Senate version leaves some 
discretion to bankruptcy judges. Currently, most Chapter 13 cases 
fail and convert to Chapter 7, bankruptcy court statistics show. But 
that escape hatch would be closed in both versions of the proposed 
law. And Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law School professor and personal-bankruptcy 
specialist, said both versions of the legislation would have dire 
consequences for people who are forced into Chapter 13 and then run 
into unexpected expenses like uninsured medical emergencies. ``When 
that happens, it is as if there was no bankruptcy filing and creditors 
can go back and charge penalty interest rates, say 27 percent, from 
the first day a payment was late plus a late fee for every month and 
legal fees,'' Professor Warren said. ``These families will have no 
protections at all. People will be at their mercy until they die.'' 
William P. Binzel, vice president for government affairs for Mastercard 
International, the other credit card giant, said that a fanciful imagination 
might conjure up such a case, but that it was unlikely in real life. 
Sen. Richard J. Durban, D-Ill., and a leading advocate of the overhaul, 
said the House version would do just what Professor Warren says, but 
he said that under the Senate version judges ``will be able to deal 
with these kinds of cases fairly.'' But Professor Warren said the 
legislation was ``so bad that if it becomes law, it will last through 
exactly one recession, and then the horror stories about what happened 
to people will force Congress to correct its mistake.'' Both sides 
agree on one thing: The next recession will be the test of whether 
the proposed new rules are workable. ``The industry wants additional 
ammunition to deal with the losses they will face,'' said David Robertson, 
president of the Nilson Report, a credit card industry newsletter 
in Oxnard, Calif. He said the changes in bankruptcy law were just 
one part of the card industry's broad strategy to prepare for the 
next recession. Robertson and Spencer Nilson, the newsletter's publisher, 
said the industry was also devising new mathematical models to measure 
risk and to more carefully rate customers for it; some lenders are 
also selling off parts of their portfolios to reduce their exposure 
in the next recession _ developments that should improve the flow 
of credit. Both men said current bankruptcy law was far too lenient. 
But Lawrence M. Ausubel, an economist at the University of Maryland, 
said he saw no reason to strengthen the hand of credit card lenders 
in bankruptcy proceedings. His research shows that the industry is 
already twice as profitable as banking over all, with returns on equity 
as high as 56 percent in recent years, though that is down from 75 
percent in the late 1980s. Visa's Layman said that only about 1 percent 
of credit card accounts ended up in bankruptcy proceedings, showing 
that ``the industry is doing a very fine job'' of measuring credit-worthiness. 
But he and Binzel of Mastercard said no refinement in lending could 
address the shortcoming in current law that allows individuals who 
can afford to repay some debts to walk away by filing Chapter 7. Ausubel 
said the changes Congress is about to adopt ``will create a worse 
social outcome'' than current law, by making it impossible for some 
people to start over. The changes, he said, would also ``encourage 
even more lending to marginal customers because the credit card industry's 
calculation will be that their probability of collecting will go up.'' 
``So they will lend even more to already overextended customers,'' 
he said.
