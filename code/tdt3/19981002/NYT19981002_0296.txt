Appearing last January as the first witness before the grand jury 
investigating President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, Betty Currie, 
the president's private secretary, conceded that her memory about 
important events ``was getting worse by the minute.'' In fact, as 
the months wore on and Mrs. Currie was recalled repeatedly to the 
grand jury, her testimony grew increasingly forgetful and confused. 
Her testimony, disclosed in its entirety on Friday by Congress, showed 
that while she never totally disavowed much of her earlier account 
_ which seemed to be somewhat damaging to her boss _ she also did 
not, in the end, turn into the powerfully incriminating witness against 
Clinton that some investigators might have hoped for. Mrs. Currie 
was an important witness on three central questions that the investigators 
spent months exploring, questions that they ultimately transformed 
into some of the grounds for the possible impeachment of the president. 
Those questions were: _ whether Clinton testified truthfully in the 
Paula Jones lawsuit when he said he could recall being alone with 
Ms. Lewinsky perhaps briefly, but only when she was delivering papers 
to him in the Oval Office _ whether Mrs. Currie's retrieval of a box 
of presidential gifts from Ms. Lewinsky last December was an effort 
by Clinton to keep them away from Mrs. Jones' lawyers, who had subpoenaed 
them in their sexual harassment lawsuit _ whether Clinton was improperly 
trying to coach a potential witness in the Jones suit when he ordered 
Mrs. Currie into the Oval Office on a Sunday, the day after his deposition 
in the Jones lawsuit, and repeated a series of questions, suggesting 
the answers, such as ``We were never alone, right?'' and ``You were 
always here when she was here, right?'' The impeachment referral sent 
by the Whitewater independent counsel to Congress last month makes 
clear many instances when Mrs. Currie's testimony shifted or was confused. 
But the report cites other evidence in order to bolster Mrs. Currie's 
most damaging testimony to make the case against Clinton. In the report 
Mrs. Currie comes across as the person who helped to arrange the clandestine 
rendezvous of the president and Ms. Lewinsky, helping the young intern 
to avoid the other officials who were trying to limit her access to 
the West Wing. But in her testimony, Mrs. Currie comes across as highly 
forgetful, a reluctant witness who has to be repeatedly prodded by 
prosecutors and reread old testimony to refresh her memory on points 
that she had sworn to in earlier appearances before the grand jury 
or interviews with prosecutors. In her first interview with investigators 
last January, Mrs. Currie told investigators that sometimes Ms. Lewinsky 
``would visit Clinton alone,'' for 20 to 30 minutes. But by July, 
she amended her testimony to say that they were ``never really alone,'' 
since Mrs. Currie was always in the outer office. ``The president, 
for all intents and purposes, is never alone,'' Mrs. Currie told the 
grand jurors. ``There's always somebody around him.'' By her July 
appearance, Mrs. Currie testified that she had also forgotten some 
of her earlier testimony about an Oval Office encounter she had with 
Clinton on the day after he was questioned in the Jones lawsuit. During 
the meeting, she said, Clinton posed a series of questions that prosecutors 
now assert was an attempt to shade Mrs. Currie's recollection in the 
event she was called as a witness. Mrs. Currie also appeared to have 
differing views about Ms. Lewinsky. On the first day that she was 
interviewed by a prosecutor, three days after the investigation became 
public, she described the relationship as ``a friendship.'' ``Currie 
advised Lewinsky was very helpful to Currie when Currie was dealing 
with some personal tragedies,'' an investigator wrote in January. 
``Currie advised she had a motherly relationship with Lewinsky.'' 
But in her testimony in May, she said that she came to regard Ms. 
Lewinsky as ``a pain in the neck'' and ``a little pushy.''
