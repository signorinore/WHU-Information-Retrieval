Even in Mexico, where people are used to hearing that politicians 
have fat bank accounts, Swiss police caused a stir when they announced 
three years ago that Raul Salinas de Gortari, the brother of the former 
president, had about $100 million in secret Swiss bank accounts. Now 
Mexican investigators say that his fortune is even heftier. Mexican 
federal prosecutors disclosed Friday that they are investigating 289 
bank accounts in Mexico, the United States and Europe controlled by 
Salinas or his accountants, with deposits totaling $119 million. Those 
funds are separate from the Swiss accounts, the investigators said. 
The Mexican government had also earlier seized an account in Britain 
holding $23.5 million. In addition, investigations have turned up 
123 properties that the authorities say belonged to Salinas, from 
homes to horse ranches, including 37 outside Mexico. No new charges 
were brought Friday against Salinas, who has been formally accused 
of graft when he was a government employee, and homicide in the 1994 
murder of a politician, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu. Nor did the investigators 
disclose what they believe may be the origin of the funds. No narcotics 
or drug money-laundering charges have been brought against Salinas 
in Mexico. But the police and prosecutors in Switzerland are preparing 
a civil drug money-laundering case against Salinas, the older brother 
of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, in an effort to seize 
his funds there. In a secret 369-page report on their inquiry, Swiss 
police investigators asserted that ``a cautious estimate'' of the 
money Raul Salinas earned from drug traffickers during the 10 years 
before his arrest would be ``a total of at least $500 million.'' But 
the Swiss investigators also acknowledged that they gathered ``sometimes 
precise and sometimes less precise information concerning the amounts 
of the drug money given to Raul Salinas.'' Salinas, who has been confined 
since February 1995 to a maximum security prison near Mexico City 
even though he has not been convicted of any crime, adamantly denies 
that he had any dealings with drug traffickers. His lawyer, Eduardo 
Luengo Creel, called the Swiss police report ``a fantasy.'' He insisted 
that all of his client's money in Swiss accounts was of legitimate 
provenance and had been contributed by prominent businessmen who were 
building an investment fund to be run by Salinas. Luengo called the 
figures released Friday by Mexico's attorney general ``truly inconceivable,'' 
adding, ``They simply don't check at all with the audits we have done 
of Salinas' assets.'' Mexican prosecutors have created confusion in 
the past over bank account totals by listing only deposits without 
calculating withdrawals. Salinas used a number of international bank 
accounts that were simply conduits, where large amounts of money were 
deposited and withdrawn every day, his lawyers said. Jose Luis Ramos 
Rivera, the top prosecutor in Salinas' case, said investigators came 
upon a trove of new financial information about Salinas after his 
chief accountant, Juan Manuel Gomez Gutierrez, jumped bail and disappeared 
in July. Police searched 25 homes and offices in Mexico City and the 
northern city of Chihuahua linked to Gomez, and found computer disks 
and documents with information on at least 70 bank accounts that the 
authorities had not known about. Ramos said Gomez had operated a network 
of front companies and had issued false loans through a foreign ``tax 
paradise,'' which Ramos declined to identify, to conceal millions 
of dollars in transactions.
