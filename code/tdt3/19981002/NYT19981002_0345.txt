Following are excerpts from conversations between Linda Tripp, a Pentagon 
aide, and Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern, and maybe 
others. The conversations were secretly recorded by Mrs. Tripp between 
Oct. 3, 1997, and Jan. 13, 1998. A Letter to the President Oct. 6, 
1997. Ms. Lewinsky decides to write a letter to the president asking 
for a job in New York by Dec. 1, 1997, and asks Mrs. Tripp for her 
help with the text. MS. LEWINSKY: Well, I typed it up. MRS. TRIPP: 
Okay. MS. LEWINSKY: So, I don't know. Okay. ``It has been made clear 
to me that there is no way I'm going to be able to come back to the 
White House. The reasons are too lengthy to get into in a letter, 
and I can explain them to you in person. ``I want you to know that 
it has always been and remains to be more important to me to have 
you in my life than to come back. Having said that, I am extremely 
underchallenged and unhappy in my current position.'' MRS. TRIPP: 
Hmm. MS. LEWINSKY: It's too choppy. ``Can you please secure a position 
for me at the U.N. as a GS-12 or 13 beginning 1 December. I would 
like to give my two-weeks' notice as soon as possible and have some 
time to get myself together. ``My roommate, a k a my mom, has recently 
taken an apartment in New York, and we are in the process of looking 
for something else in D.C. It doesn't look like I can stay here. I 
need to be _ if I need something before we make any more commitments 
here.'' MRS. TRIPP: Mm-hmm. MS. LEWINSKY: Before we make any commitments 
... ``Handsome: You have been distant the past few months and shut 
me out. I don't know why. Is it that you don't like me anymore or 
are you scared? Please let me come see you this evening or Thursday 
night. I want to hear it, I want to hear it from you. No one else. 
I don't think it is asking too much after all that has happened to 
ask to have this discussion in person.'' MRS. TRIPP: Brilliant, except 
for the one part. MS. LEWINSKY: Which one part? MRS. TRIPP: If you 
put a 12 or 13 there, I am going to throw up. MS. LEWINSKY: Okay. 
Well, I don't have to put it? What do you mean? MRS. TRIPP: Oh, Monica, 
Monica, Monica. For people who are not even in any situation, they 
can do better. MS. LEWINSKY: Oh, Linda, please don't start with me 
on that. MRS. TRIPP: He would want to do better, so don't limit him 
is what I'm saying. MS. LEWINSKY: Okay. You know what I'll do. Okay, 
this is what I'll do. I will bring all my little paperwork that I 
had made up to have my meeting ... and show him there and say, ``This 
is what I am making. This is what I should be making. This is what 
I'd like to make.'' MRS. TRIPP: (Sigh) MS. LEWINSKY: Okay, look, Linda 
_ MRS. TRIPP: Look. In New York _ MS. LEWINSKY: _ you know, this isn't 
just one way. MRS. TRIPP: Let me just say this _ no, no, no. New York, 
the cost of living is even higher than here. MS. LEWINSKY: I know 
it is, but you'll also get a cost of living adjustment. MRS. TRIPP: 
No, it's not significant. MS. LEWINSKY: No, but let me tell you something. 
Okay? I just want you to look at this from his position for a minute. 
Okay? MRS. TRIPP: Mm-hmm. MS. LEWINSKY: He's thinking to himself, 
``I'm going to take this girl and I'm moving her. And the reason I'm 
moving her and the reason all this is happening is because she was 
my girlfriend. And I'm going to make her go from making $30,000 a 
year to $90,000 a year.'' MRS. TRIPP: No, no. But what I'm saying 
is this is done routinely. MS. LEWINSKY: But _ I know. But the reason 
it's done is not routine. I think that's going to scare the ... out 
of him. MRS. TRIPP: Well, no, because actually, he doesn't have to 
establish the grade. That's, that's out of his hands. What he can 
do _ MS. LEWINSKY: Okay. Well, look, I'll take it out of the letter. 
MRS. TRIPP: Okay. MS. LEWINSKY: I'll take it out of the letter. MRS. 
TRIPP: I would just say let's not limit yourself. A Talk With Jordan 
Oct. 16, 1997. Ms. Lewinsky tells Mrs. Tripp of a conversation with 
Vernon Jordan, a friend of President Clinton. MRS. TRIPP: So you talked 
to him this morning? MS. LEWINSKY: So I talked to him around _ it 
was around 3:00, I think. MRS. TRIPP: Okay. MS. LEWINSKY: And, uh, 
his general attitude was, you know, ``As long as you have a job that 
you're going to, I _ you know, I want you to be happy, so whatever 
you want to do.'' MRS. TRIPP: Uh. So he wasn't suspicious. MS. LEWINSKY: 
Of course he was suspicious. MRS. TRIPP: He was? MS. LEWINSKY: You 
know, he asked me point blank if I, you know, had a thing with him. 
MRS. TRIPP: He asked you point blank. No, he didn't. MS. LEWINSKY: 
Yes, he did. MRS. TRIPP: What did he say? MS. LEWINSKY: He said, ``Did 
you have an affair with him?'' MRS. TRIPP: He said, ``Did you have 
an affair with the President?'' You're kidding. MS. LEWINSKY: Not 
``the P,'' but with him. I mean, obviously that's what he meant, he 
just didn't say the name. MRS. TRIPP: Really? MS. LEWINSKY: And I 
said no. I mean, I said, ``But to tell you the truth, if I had, I 
would say no still.'' MRS. TRIPP: You said that? MS. LEWINSKY: Uh-huh. 
MRS. TRIPP: And what did he say? MS. LEWINSKY: Nothing. MRS. TRIPP: 
(Laughter.) So I wonder if he wonders. MS. LEWINSKY: I'm sure he wonders. 
I'm sure he _ MRS. TRIPP: Did you tell him he was helping you? MS. 
LEWINSKY: Mm-hmm. MRS. TRIPP: Did he question that? MS. LEWINSKY: 
No. MRS. TRIPP: See, that was the part I thought he would question. 
MS. LEWINSKY: No, because I _ I didn't really _ it was _ it came out 
fine. It was, you know _ oh ((WORDS DELETED)) hold on. Oh, my God. 
Uh _ okay. I told that, you know _ see I knew this would work with 
him. I knew that bringing in _ just the whole idea that, like, I had 
conversations with him. Do you know what I mean? MRS. TRIPP: Really? 
MS. LEWINSKY: Just that whole idea makes everything almost okay. MRS. 
TRIPP: Really? MS. LEWINSKY: Yeah. I mean, this is like _ you know, 
he's like a normal person. MRS. TRIPP: Yeah. MS. LEWINSKY: You know 
what I mean? Like, you know, we're jaded, we're very jaded. MRS. TRIPP: 
So having a conversation with the big creep is no big deal to us. 
MS. LEWINSKY: Right. MRS. TRIPP: But it is to _ yeah. MS. LEWINSKY: 
You know, so he _ he was very cool. So, you know, I _ I explained, 
I said, uh, you know, this, that (coughing). So he said, you know, 
``That's what happens.'' I was really upset in general. I called you 
when I got _ I went out this morning, and I came home, and I was so 
upset, Linda. MRS. TRIPP: Why? MS. LEWINSKY: I was just _ I was so 
angry, and I just _ I was disgusted, like nauseous. MRS. TRIPP: About? 
MS. LEWINSKY: About what's happened. Like the fact that I'm not going 
back there, just nauseous about it. MRS. TRIPP: I know. I keep going 
back and forth with the same thing. MS. LEWINSKY: You know, but _ 
(sigh). They _ they were never gonna to do it, you know, so _ because, 
look, the truth is is that _ plus they had had three weeks and there 
was still nothing. All they had to do was ((words deleted)) create 
something. MRS. TRIPP: Or at least give you an update. MS. LEWINSKY: 
Right, you know. MRS. TRIPP: ``It looks like this,'' or, ``It looks 
like that.'' But you got nothing. MS. LEWINSKY: Nothing, you know. 
MRS. TRIPP: Which _ you know, then I wonder if you had pushed, would 
that have ever come to anything. But I don't know. MS. LEWINSKY: I 
don't think so. I don't think so, you know. MRS. TRIPP: (Sigh.) Well, 
I _ I have such mixed feelings about the whole thing. MS. LEWINSKY: 
I mean, I _ don't you think the telling part of it was how quickly 
there was movement on this? MRS. TRIPP: As soon as you said New York. 
MS. LEWINSKY: Mm-hmm. MRS. TRIPP: Mm-hmm. Well, It's _ It's _ without 
a doubt, easier for them to do this. Do I think it was impossible 
the other way? No. I just don't know _ I don't know whether I trust 
them to do what they say they were going to do. White House Involvement 
Oct. 16, 1997. The women discuss whether Erskine Bowles, the White 
House chief of staff, should be involved in finding Ms. Lewinsky a 
job. MRS. TRIPP: If he _ if he is at all involved, this is right up 
his alley, too. He's got more connections in industry and every other 
thing than you can imagine. MS. LEWINSKY: Along with the ((WORDS DELETED)) 
too. MRS. TRIPP: Well ((WORD DELETED)) he's amazing. So between the 
two of them, he can _ MS. LEWINSKY: Well, see, I don't really think 
_ I'm going to tell him that I don't think Erskine should have anything 
to do with this. I don't think anybody who works there should. MRS. 
TRIPP: I don't see how that's _ how that's a problem. MS. LEWINSKY: 
Because look at what happened with Webb Hubbell. I'm just saying _ 
MRS. TRIPP: Oh, please. MS. LEWINSKY: I'm just saying _ MRS. TRIPP. 
(Sigh) MS. LEWINSKY: You know? MRS. TRIPP: Yeah, but this isn't _ 
are you _ are you telling me that you think Erskine doesn't place 
people every day of the week? I mean, come on. That's how networking 
works. MS. LEWINSKY: But not people _ MRS. TRIPP: He has no connection 
_ MS. LEWINSKY: _ who worked _ MRS. TRIPP: He has no connection with 
you. MS. LEWINSKY: I don't know. I just think Vernon is a lot safer. 
MRS. TRIPP: Well, I don't remember during the Webb Hubbell thing, 
was Vernon mentioned? MS. LEWINSKY: Yeah, but there's a big difference. 
I think somebody could construe, okay? Somebody could construe or 
say, ``Well, they gave her a job to shut her up. They made her happy.'' 
MRS. TRIPP: Hmpf. MS. LEWINSKY: ``And he works for the government 
and shouldn't have done that.'' And with the other one you can't say 
that. MRS. TRIPP: Well, that's true. MS. LEWINSKY: That's why I think 
it's not bright. ... In the same conversation, Ms. Lewinsky speaks 
of visiting the president and of a recommendation from John Hilley, 
the White House director of legislative affairs, the office in which 
she had worked. MS. LEWINSKY: Okay. Huh. Betty came back to get me, 
okay? We were in the back office. We start _ the three of us start 
to walk out. He's got one arm around Betty and one arm around me. 
MRS. TRIPP: Aw. MS. LEWINSKY: Okay? He kisses me on the head _ MRS. 
TRIPP: Hmpf. MS. LEWINSKY: _ and then we _ we kind of start and he 
_ and then he kind of grabs my arm and he said, ``Oh, one more thing 
I have to tell you.'' And so Betty kind of walked out, she walked 
outside. And he _ then he told me. MRS. TRIPP: And how did he say 
it? MS. LEWINSKY: He said that _ he said, ``Oh, one other thing that 
I talked to Erskine about was trying to get John Hilley to give you 
either a written recommendation or a verbal, you know, recommendation 
so that, you know, you _ you feel you have a _ you know, you _ he'll 
give you a good recommendation for your work here.'' Concern for Lewinsky 
Nov. 20, 1997. Ms. Lewinsky discusses Paula Jones, and Mrs. Tripp 
expresses concern for Ms. Lewinsky. MRS. TRIPP: You're in a horrible 
predicament right now. MS. LEWINSKY: I know. MRS. TRIPP: You're in 
a horrible predicament right now. And you know what they say, the 
best offense is a good deep _ the best defense is a good offense? 
Um, my big fear has been all along that because of your repeated messages 
over there and phone calls and things, messengers and all this stuff, 
my big fear has been that instead of waiting for the off chance that 
you might do something, that's been my big fear. MS. LEWINSKY: Then 
they do something. Linda, then that's what they'll do. I'm not _ I 
would rather let them say something bad about me than get into a whole 
thing because you know what? I have zero respect. I have zero respect. 
And this has nothing to do with him. It has to do with the fact that 
this person is doing a good job for this country. I have zero respect 
for Paula Jones because of that. MRS. TRIPP: I know. MS. LEWINSKY: 
Because she is causing trouble for this country. MRS. TRIPP: Mm-hmm. 
MS. LEWINSKY: Kathleen, I have zero respect for that. I have zero 
respect for people like that, and I would never do it. I don't care 
if they get out of there and say I'm a crazy person who is chasing 
him. I don't care. MRS. TRIPP: That is what they would say. MS. LEWINSKY: 
Well, then that's what they'll say. And anybody who says anything 
to the contrary, be it my friend or not my friend, I will deny it. 
MRS. TRIPP: I know. MS. LEWINSKY: Because that's not the kind of person 
I am. I think it's disgusting. I think what they're doing is disgusting, 
if that's what they do, you know. I don't think so. I don't _ I don't 
think that's their fear. Because if they were really afraid _ as I 
said to you today, if they were really afraid that I would do something, 
they would have brought me back. MRS. TRIPP: Yeah. MS. LEWINSKY: They're 
more afraid of what other people would say. MRS. TRIPP: Yeah, you're 
right. MS. LEWINSKY: So _ MRS. TRIPP: So it would have been easier 
to just put you right back there where you would be happy and not, 
you know _ you're right. MRS. TRIPP: So I just _ it doesn't matter. 
I don't they're gonna do that, and I think that's the being paranoid 
thinking it. So _ MRS. TRIPP: (Sighing) Well, I'm happy your mother's 
coming home tomorrow. MS. LEWINSKY: Me, too. MRS. TRIPP: Because this 
is _ this is beyond belief. You said before that you'll hang up on 
him when he calls and then you don't. So don't chastise yourself if 
you don't. MS. LEWINSKY: Well, I don't want to talk to him. I mean, 
there's nothing to say. There is nothing to say. MRS. TRIPP: Well, 
let me put it to you this way. By hanging up and saying you're telling 
your parents and then hanging up the phone, you're saying a whole 
hell of a lot more than you could ever do in a 20-minute conversation. 
MS. LEWINSKY: I know. (tape skip) (inaudible) my mom will kill me 
if I don't tell him _ make it clear at some point that I'm not going 
to hurt him, because _ see my mom's big fear is that he's going to 
send somebody out to kill me. MRS. TRIPP: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
MS. LEWINSKY: So _ MRS. TRIPP: Shut up. MS. LEWINSKY: Well, that's 
what she thinks. MRS. TRIPP: Oh, my God. Don't even say such an asinine 
thing. He's not that stupid. He's an arrogant ((word deleted)) but 
he's not that stupid. MS. LEWINSKY: Well, you know, accidents happen. 
MRS. TRIPP: Oh, please, Don't even say that. Someone will walk over 
my grave when you say things like that. (Sighing.) I believe he knows 
that you're not going to hurt him. If you have to say it, say it. 
Look, all you have to say is, ``You have nothing to worry about from 
me.''
