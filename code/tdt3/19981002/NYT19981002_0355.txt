Sidney Blumenthal, a senior White House adviser, told a grand jury 
in June that President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, had suggested 
to him in separate conversations that Clinton was simply ``ministering'' 
to Monica Lewinsky in a spiritual fashion. Under questioning from 
prosecutors, Blumenthal testified about a meeting he had with the 
president in January, a few days after the first news reports of a 
possible sexual liaison between Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky. Blumenthal 
said he was working on the State of the Union address when he found 
himself summoned to the Oval Office by President Clinton. He said 
he told the president that he had met earlier that day with Mrs. Clinton 
. ``I related to the president my conversation with the first lady,'' 
Blumenthal testified, ``and the conversation was as follows: ``The 
first lady said that she was distressed that the president was being 
attacked, in her view, for political motives, for his ministry of 
a troubled person.'' He continued: ``The first lady said he had done 
this dozens if not hundreds of times with people. The president had 
come from a broken home, and this was very hard to prevent him from 
trying to minister to these troubled people.'' Blumenthal then testified 
that he had told the president he was aware of his efforts to help 
people and admired those efforts. He said he even knew of a woman 
in Arkansas who would have committed suicide but for Clinton's help. 
But Blumenthal told the grand jury that he then cautioned the president 
that people who needed ministering were by their nature unstable and 
added, ``You're president and these troubled people can get you into 
incredible messes.'' He said he urged the president to cut himself 
off from people like Ms. Lewinsky. He said that Clinton replied: ``It's 
difficult for me to do that, given how I am. I want to help people.''
