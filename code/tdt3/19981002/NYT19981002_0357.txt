Whether or not anyone has cited the story of David and Bathsheba either 
to defend or denounce President Clinton on Sunday morning television, 
plenty of people have done so in the Sunday morning pulpits. Quite 
a few of them have even called Walter Brueggemann, professor of Old 
Testament at Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Ga., for advice. 
Brueggemann is the author of a commentary for preaching on I and II 
Samuel, the two books in the Hebrew Scriptures that tell the story 
of ancient Israel's transformation from a constellation of tribes 
to a centralized monarchy under Saul and David. It is also where the 
story of David and Bathsheba appears. He has also written on the parallel 
account of David in the First Book of Chronicles, where _ shades of 
cover-up! _ the Bathsheba Affair goes unmentioned, and on Psalm 51, 
traditionally considered David's cry of repentance for his wrongdoing. 
Clinton's remarks to religious leaders at the breakfast Sept. 11 were 
filled with allusions to Psalm 51, clearly modeling his repentance 
on David's. The story of David and Bathsheba is so embedded in our 
cultural consciousness that ``it is one of the first things you think 
of,'' Brueggemann said in a telephone conversation Wednesday. But 
those who remember the story only from Sunday School or literary retelling 
ought to blow the dust off a Bible and go directly to Chapters 11 
and 12 in II Samuel. As Chapter 11 opens, Israel's forces have gone 
out to battle. Like the ominous thread of movie music signaling approaching 
danger, a line at the end of the first verse hints that something 
is amiss: ``But David remained at Jerusalem.'' In his commentary, 
``First and Second Samuel'' (John Knox Press, 1990), Brueggemann imagines 
``a powerful silence back in Jerusalem.'' The king is so sure of himself 
that he ``now relies on agents to do his work.'' David, in his leisure, 
spots the beautiful Bathsheba, and now, Brueggemann observes, ``the 
action is quick. The verbs rush as the passion of David rushed. He 
sent; he took; he lay.'' There is no indication of conversation, caring, 
affection, love. ``At the end of the encounter,'' Brueggemann notes, 
``she is only `the woman.''' Her first reported words come later, 
and the message is devastating: ``I am pregnant.'' The plot shifts 
into a higher, more deadly gear: David furloughs Uriah, Bathsheba's 
husband, and tries to wheedle him into her bed so the royal paternity 
will be unknown. When that plan collapses because Uriah is, in fact, 
a loyal, disciplined soldier, David takes his cover-up a desperate 
step further. He uses his trusty aide Joab to make sure that Uriah 
is killed in battle. David can marry Bathsheba and things appear fine 
to everyone's eyes. Except God's. This story is so swift and spare 
that everyone, from rabbinical sages of long ago to today's feminist 
exegetes, have filled in details and speculated on motives. Who was 
this silent, passive Bathsheba? (She would come into her own later, 
as mother of King Solomon.) Was Uriah really so innocent or a potential 
blackmailer? And Joab, was he a man who simply followed orders blindly 
or a knowing hatchet man who connived without leaving a paper trail? 
In any case, for David and Israel, ``we are at a moment of no return,'' 
Brueggemann writes. A spasm of lust, a ruthless cover-up, and ``innocence 
is never to be retrieved.'' Chapter 12, of course, recounts the dramatic 
confrontation (``You are the man'') between David and Nathan the prophet, 
who traps the king into confessing his guilt. God had blessed David, 
now God will punish him and his household with endless troubles. ``This 
is a sin that cuts so deeply into the life of David and Israel that 
it rivals in power the sin of Adam and Eve,'' Brueggemann says. ``Both 
result in a future under a curse.'' And yet. David may never be the 
same, but he is forgiven nonetheless. ``I have sinned against the 
Lord,'' he exclaims to Nathan _ not even a four-minute speech but 
two Hebrew words (hata'ti lyhwh). ``The Lord has put away your sin,'' 
Nathan immediately replies. Despite his sin, and all the suffering 
it unloosed, David will remain the model of the Messianic king. And 
from his marriage with Bathsheba, begun under the shadow of adultery 
and murder, will come the glorious King Solomon. Was David sincere 
in his repentance? The narrator of II Samuel clearly wants us to think 
so, Brueggemann said Wednesday, but the professor's own skepticism 
was not disguised by his friendly drawl. The David of Samuel, he explained, 
``is just an incredible wheeler-dealer, and endlessly duplicitous.'' 
By contrast, he said, ``there is nothing of that in Psalm 51,'' which 
he described as ``the voice of someone profoundly alienated from God 
and come to the point that he or she simply can't go on that way.'' 
Brueggemann said Clinton's use of the psalm was highly appropriate, 
but he did not try to read Clinton's heart. ``Either it was deeply 
felt or a great ploy,'' he said. Brueggemann immediately pointed out 
that the president had not done anything that we know about that compared 
to King David's facilitating of a husband's death. But in any case 
Brueggemann always warns against ``making a one-on-one connection 
with anything in the Bible.'' ``The Bible doesn't work that way,'' 
he said. ``It is suggestive and provides us with a way to think,'' 
he said. Or as he pointed out in his commentary, the writer of the 
Book of Samuel ``has cut very, very deep into the strange web of foolishness, 
fear and fidelity that comprises the human map.'' ``This narrative,'' 
he said, ``is more than we want to know about David and more than 
we can bear to understand about ourselves.'' Suggestive, indeed.
