David Cone is reeling, and he does not mind admitting it. His eyes 
are hollow-looking from the death of Dan Quisenberry and the revelation 
that Darryl Strawberry has colon cancer. Somehow, Cone went out and 
pitched the third game of this league division series Friday night, 
with the New York Yankees leading the Texas Rangers, two games to 
none. When asked if he could get on the mound 24 hours after hearing 
the ugly news about Strawberry, Cone said: ``Yes, very much. Probably 
wearing Darryl's number on the back of my hat. I don't mean this as 
some sort of cheap way for motivation.'' He planned to ink Strawberry's 
No. 39 on his cap, not the first time he had paid homage to a man 
he admired. When Keith Hernandez left the New York Mets, Cone briefly 
wore uniform No. 17, in honor of the intense first baseman who had 
taught him so much about baseball. Cone also made a point of talking 
about Quisenberry, who died of a brain tumor Wednesday. They overlapped 
one year in Kansas City, in 1986, when Cone pitched 11 games as a 
kid with a live arm, and Quisenberry was nearing the end of his career 
as a superlative relief pitcher. ``Quiz shook me up,'' Cone said Thursday. 
``I knew he was in bad shape, but you're never ready for this. He 
was such a great guy. He never big-timed me. He'd just take you aside 
and tell you how major leaguers do things.'' The younger player observed 
how Quisenberry and Hernandez approached their careers _ Quisenberry 
with a wry sense of humor, Hernandez with a manic perfectionism. Taking 
his cue from them, Cone has become perhaps the most accessible and 
interesting New York athlete of this decade. When his brain went into 
vapor lock over an umpire's call and he lost sight of a runner steaming 
home, he delivered his mea culpa after the game. When he suffered 
a dangerous aneurysm in his pitching arm, he talked about it. This 
time it was the death of one friend and the health scare of another. 
``When it strikes this close to home, it shakes you up, it really 
does,'' Cone said Thursday. ``It's a big slap in the face. Reality 
sets in, and you realize what's really important.'' Cone is not a 
member of the Yankee contingent that conducts Christian worship at 
the ball park, but he does understand the spiritual U-turn Strawberry 
has made. ``He gets his life together, now this,'' Cone said with 
a recognition that life does not pretend to be fair. Cone has had 
more than his share of injuries, tearing up a knee in the minor leagues 
and sitting out the 1983 season, breaking a finger while bunting to 
end his first year with the Mets in 1987. In the 1995 divisional loss 
to Seattle, he pitched long and valiantly, and he needed an operation 
for the aneurysm in 1996. ``Darryl is in great hands over at Columbia 
Presbyterian,'' Cone said Thursday. ``I know from a first-hand basis 
that it is a great place to be, they're great doctors.'' He also remembered 
what a jolt it was to be told he needed an operation. ``I didn't understand 
what was happening to me,'' Cone said. ``I needed to be educated. 
I didn't know if it was life or death or if my career was over, but 
those sort of life-and-death situations supersede baseball in every 
way. ``I'm sure Darryl is going through the same fears I was, and 
that he doesn't know what's going on. He probably doesn't understand 
all the medical jargon that's being thrown his way. It's an extremely 
difficult situation, and it can be very confusing and very scary.'' 
Cone came back from that operation, but last October he needed more 
shoulder surgery. He surprised everybody by being able to pitch when 
the season opened, but when he started poorly, his morbid side told 
him his career might be over. Instead, he tinkered with his delivery, 
survived being bitten on the index finger by his mother's dog, and 
wound up with 20 victories and 9 losses and a 3.55 earned run average 
with 209 strikeouts. ``David has been around,'' said his manager, 
Joe Torre. ``He's had to deal with his own stress. If it was a kid, 
I'd say something, maybe, but David Cone will be able to pitch.'' 
As it turned out, Cone's suggestion inspired Yankee management to 
have No. 39 embroidered on the backs of all their caps in time for 
Friday night's game. Some of the Rangers inked No. 39 on their caps, 
too. Then David Cone, his eyes still red, did what he knows best. 
He went out to pitch.
