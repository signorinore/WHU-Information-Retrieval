It has been just shy of a year since stocks in companies that serve 
the oil drilling industry began a long, grueling selloff that has 
left even bearish energy analysts surprised by its severity. Those 
who bought last fall, when these stocks peaked, have watched as the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's Oil and Gas Equipment Index has fallen 56 percent 
from its high on Nov. 5. The culprits: last winter's mild weather; 
expanding oil production, which tends to drive these stocks down as 
oil prices drop, and, most of all, the financial crisis in Asia, which 
has slaked the once unquenchable thirst for oil there. The price of 
West Texas intermediate crude oil, which in October 1997 had hovered 
at $22 a barrel, fell to just more than $12 last June. ``It's been 
a brutal group,'' said Daniel R. Pickering, an analyst who follows 
the industry for Simmons &AMP; Company International in Houston. Since 
June, however, crude has staged a modest rebound, rising to $15.64 
on Friday; major oil-producing countries are making the production 
cuts they promised earlier this year, and inventories are dropping. 
The trends, though still tenuous, have generated enough optimism to 
breathe a spark of life into the battered stocks of some oil service 
companies. For example, Schlumberger Ltd., which hit a 52-week low 
of $43.75 in August, closed on Friday at $48.5625. So is it time for 
investors to jump back in? Are these still bargain-basement prices? 
Some analysts think so, and are adding oil service companies to their 
``buy'' lists. Money managers have been purchasing shares. And executives 
and directors in oil service companies including Baker Hughes, Schlumberger 
and Global Marine, are buying their companies' shares. ``It's encouraging 
to see them buying their own stock,'' said Frank Ponticello, who follows 
insider buying trends for Prudential Securities. Stock prices in this 
industry are often tied closely to those of crude oil. Some stocks 
have begun to move up with oil prices, even while the companies post 
declining earnings and keep their charges low to drillers. Among the 
buyers are Howard F. Ward, manager of the Gabelli Growth fund. He 
has increased his holdings of Schlumberger, Baker Hughes and Halliburton. 
``They have gone from being Wall Street's darlings to being put in 
the penalty box,'' Ward said. ``That's generally when stocks of high-quality 
companies should be bought _ when they are way out of favor.'' By 
jumping in now, investors risk short-term weakness in oil prices. 
But if they wait, they might miss the sudden jumps that such stocks 
often make when a preponderance of evidence begins pointing toward 
higher oil prices. In the near term, earnings of these companies may 
well fail to meet expectations. Shares of Baker Hughes, for example, 
plummeted by almost 10 percent on Sept. 24, when it announced that 
it would earn about half of the 36 cents a share that analysts had 
predicted. ``We're kind of in the trough here,'' said Pickering, the 
analyst. ``We just have to get past a period when it's going to be 
a rocky road.'' Pickering says oil is in a long-term trend toward 
higher prices, giving investors and oil companies reason for optimism, 
yet it will take some time for that to translate into better earnings 
for the companies that provide the gear used in the oilfields. Indeed, 
it may take as long as six months for higher prices to lead to increases 
in drilling activity, and rates charged for rigs will remain low in 
the interim. The number of rigs operating last week was 754, compared 
with 1,001 in the corresponding week last year. The count dropped 
to a record low of 596 in 1993. Arvind S. Sanger, oil service analyst 
for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, said that if crude remained 
in its current price range, big oil service companies would likely 
continue buying smaller ones. And the offers often cause sharp price 
run-ups. Already, Baker Hughes has acquired Western Atlas. When the 
offer was announced on May 11, shares of Western Atlas rose to $92.875, 
a 14 percent increase. Halliburton announced on Feb. 26 that it would 
buy Dresser Industries, valuing its offer at $46.50 a share, which 
was 20 percent above Dresser's closing price the day before. EVI agreed 
on March 4 to buy Weatherford Enterra for $46.23 a share, 49 percent 
above the price the previous day. Over all, however, Sanger recommends 
big, lower-risk stocks like Halliburton, now trading at $28.25; he 
predicts that it will reach $48 a share by the end of next year. He 
also favors the new Weatherford International, now trading at $20.25 
(1999 projection: $55) and J. Ray McDermott, now at $29.9375 (1999 
projection: $53). Sanger said that both Halliburton and Weatherford 
should achieve big savings through their mergers and that J. Ray McDermott 
is rich in cash. Sam Z. Albright, an oil service analyst at Jeffries 
&AMP; Co. in Houston, recommends Noble Drilling, which closed at $14.1875 
on Friday; Santa Fe International, $14.875; and Transocean Offshore, 
$30.3125. All have large backlogs of work for their rigs and have 
strong balance sheets. Generally, they are involved with deep-water 
drilling programs. These long-term projects require huge amounts of 
capital, and the oil companies that run them are reluctant to pull 
out. In a September report, Jeffries &AMP; Co., set 12-month target 
prices for Noble at $23, Santa Fe at $26 and Transocean at $47 a share.
