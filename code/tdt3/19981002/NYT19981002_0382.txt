They talked on and on, about haircuts, diets, sex and more sex. But 
the tapes of the phone chats between Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp 
show less a real friendship than a temporary alliance between two 
women obsessed by Bill Clinton who often don't even seem to like each 
other very much. Mrs. Tripp, who made the tapes, comes off in the 
conversations she arranged as unable to resist making her feelings 
of moral and intellectual superiority clear to the younger woman. 
She corrects Ms. Lewinsky's grammar, sighs at her romantic yearnings, 
edits her love notes, ridicules her girlish handwriting and needles 
her with such zingers as ``He's never been attracted to you because 
you use big words.'' When Ms. Lewinsky admits with some embarrassment 
that she has sent the president her thoughts on education reform, 
Mrs. Tripp responds, ``Oh, you mean an actual idea.'' At every opportunity, 
she prods Ms. Lewinsky to push the president harder to get her a job, 
and not just any job. She tries to persuade Ms. Lewinsky that she's 
thinking too small, settling for too little and going too easy on 
Clinton. In Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury testimony, the former White 
House intern presented herself as an operator who aggressively lobbied 
the president to find her a well-paying, low-stress job. But these 
tapes show the extent to which Ms. Lewinsky was in turn influenced 
by Mrs. Tripp. Word by word, she helped Ms. Lewinsky write the letter 
demanding that the president help her get a big job. When the two 
women discuss their own relationship, they pledge a certain devotion 
but acknowledge some problems. Ms. Lewinsky asks Mrs. Tripp if she's 
ever noticed how they make each other angry. And Mrs. Tripp, at another 
point, says: ``The problem I have with you, frankly, is I feel entirely 
too maternal towards you. And it's almost like when I'm yelling at 
my kids, not that that ever has any effect. When I yell at you, it's 
out of love.'' The tapes released Friday fill in the blanks of a relationship 
perhaps more mysterious than that between a younger woman and an older 
man. Ms. Lewinsky, a recent college graduate in her first professional 
job, and Mrs. Tripp, who is about twice her age, became close at the 
Pentagon, where both had been reassigned from the Clinton White House. 
But unlike Ms. Lewinsky, who was transferred against her will for 
having a crush on the president, Mrs. Tripp had come to dislike the 
Clintons intensely and felt she was shoved out for opposite reasons. 
Mrs. Tripp seems to become so involved in the relationship between 
Ms. Lewinsky and the president that she even appears to try managing 
the sex itself. After hearing a breathy holiday message Ms. Lewinsky 
has recorded for the president, Mrs. Tripp says, `No wonder he likes 
to have phone sex with you _ you're just like a little Marilyn Monroe 
vixen,'' and then encourages her to rerecord it to make it a little 
tartier. For her part, Ms. Lewinsky, who seems to feel more comfortable 
with older men and women than with people her own age, leans heavily 
on Mrs. Tripp but clearly resents her attitude, frequently answering 
her putdowns with ``Thank you very much.'' Still, she does not seem 
to be able to stop confiding in her, perhaps because Mrs. Tripp shows 
an unusual willingness to listen to a replay of endless detail of 
the presidential affair. In the end, it is the everydayness of their 
hours and hours of conversation _ the ``Hang on a minute,'' ``Don't 
go anywhere, my dinner's heating, I'm starving,'' and ``Cleo, get 
off that couch'' _ that makes the conversations taped by the one friend 
unbeknownst to the other so ugly. One friend is losing her way, calling 
herself a crazy person and wondering how she can live without her 
wonderful, awful, married lover, the president. The other is jabbering 
about her bad haircut and quietly collecting evidence. In her grand 
jury testimony, Mrs. Tripp defended her decision to make the tapes 
of their conversations. ``My idea was never to manufacture evidence. 
In fact, I had never even thought about the independent counsel in 
my wildest dreams. My idea was, I'm going to arm myself with records 
so when I'm in a position to speak under oath I can do so truthfully, 
not to be set up in a perjury trap, and say, `Fine, you think I'm 
committing perjury _ here, have a look.' ``At no time did I make a 
conscious effort to catalog or document or even date the conversations. 
It was just my way of having my backup so that when I had the fear 
of losing everything that I had worked for my entire life, and my 
children, that I would have some way of proving that I was not lying 
under oath.'' In the conversations she recorded, there are a few funny 
moments, as when Ms. Lewinsky says, ``Linda, if I ever want to have 
an affair with a married man again _ especially if he's president 
_ please shoot me.'' (Mrs. Tripp laughs and promises to follow through.) 
But mostly the tapes are a depressing record of a brand of betrayal 
that some single women might consider more devastating than that of 
an unfaithful man. At least obliquely, Mrs. Tripp repeatedly signals 
Ms. Lewinsky that for her own good, she will hurt her to make sure 
she gets out of the relationship. ``I know you're going to hate me, 
Monica,'' she tells her at one point, when the two are discussing 
how hard the president is really trying to help her. ``I want you 
the ... out of there. I want you with a life.'' There are many other 
moments when Mrs. Tripp overtly encourages Ms. Lewinsky in her belief 
that there is hope for her with the president, telling her that the 
president clearly does care for her but can't be with her, because 
of the possible consequences: ``I don't think he has it in him to 
say, ``I meant it _ I wanted you back _ I want you in my life, but 
I can't do it.'' In an e-mail to Mrs. Tripp, Ms. Lewinsky says, ``I 
will also be checking my messages in the hopes that the creep will 
call and say: `Thank you for my love note. I love you. Will you run 
away with me?'' What do you think the likelihood of that happening 
is?'' And Mrs. Tripp blatantly eggs her on, ``Ah, but that has already 
transpired, says my omnipotent crystal ball,'' and ``You will come 
home to an opportunity to get together with the creep, I am positive.'' 
There does not seem to be a huge maturity gap between the two women. 
When Ms. Lewinsky says she may also be falling for Vernon Jordan, 
the president's friend, who has been dispatched to help her find work, 
Mrs. Tripp's only response is that yes, Jordan is attractive, or as 
she says, ``very crushable.'' And her advice to her young colleague 
is pretty uniformly bad. Her thought for a good job option for Ms. 
Lewinsky in New York, for example, is to check with Susan Thomases, 
Hillary Rodham Clinton's good friend. When Mrs. Tripp testified before 
the grand jury, she said her disillusionment with the Clinton administration 
dated to the first days after Clinton took office. She was appalled 
by how the new administration dismissed many senior civil servants 
to fulfill a campaign promise to cut White House staff by 25 percent, 
and then replaced them with political appointees. She saw Gary Aldrich, 
a former Secret Service agent who wrote a tell-all book about the 
Clintons, as a ``professional, decent, honorable'' man who was ``slimed'' 
by the White House. ``I had a vast font of knowledge and exposure 
to things that went on in this White House that I found appalling, 
and I had made a decision in 1996 to go forward with revelations about 
what I had seen, but fear drove me away from what would have been 
a product that would have certainly lost me my job.'' When Mrs. Tripp 
speaks with Ms. Lewinsky about the president, it is with considerable, 
though usually modulated, anger. She tells her: ``Most people going 
through what you've gone through would have said, ``Hey ... you and 
the horse you rode in on, and let me call the National Enquirer. You 
know? He has no business yelling at you and saying, `If I had known 
what kind of person you were in the beginning, I wouldn't have gotten 
involved with you.''' Mrs. Tripp also makes it clear that she believes 
Clinton has abused Ms. Lewinsky, and only fleetingly gets Ms. Lewinsky 
to agree. ``You protect him, every inch of the way,'' Mrs. Tripp says 
in frustration. But she still seems to want to be in on every aspect 
of the relationship between the president and his former intern. When 
Ms. Lewinsky worries that Clinton must think she's an idiot because 
her notes have not always been well-written, Mrs. Tripp sighs and 
says, ``I think most of the things that I've seen are well done. Of 
course, you've let a few slip that I haven't seen.'' Ms. Lewinsky 
gives Mrs. Tripp presents, and showers her with affection and gratitude 
in a way that Mrs. Tripp obviously enjoys. But like her involvement 
with the president, the relationship is way off-kilter and in the 
end, one-sided. When Ms. Lewinsky thanks her friend for helping her 
tape the sexy message to the president, she gushes, ``Here you are, 
sitting on the phone, going over all this stupid ... with me, listening 
to the tapes.'' Mrs. Tripp responds, ``It's because I care about you, 
and I _ you know, in my heart of hearts.''
