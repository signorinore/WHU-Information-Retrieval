Darryl Strawberry was resting Friday afternoon when the telephone 
rang in his home in Fort Lee, N.J. Charisse, his wife, would not disturb 
him. They were preparing for the emotional journey to Columbia-Presbyterian 
Medical Center in Manhattan, where Strawberry will undergo surgery 
for colon cancer. ``He's tired,'' she said. ``We're going to walk 
out the door soon. Our faith has gotten us through a lot.'' Then she 
laughed, a nervous laugh from a nervous wife. Her famous husband, 
one of the most popular and affable players on the New York Yankees, 
is undergoing surgery Saturday to remove a malignant tumor. Strawberry 
communicated to his teammates with an uplifting video message that 
they viewed before batting practice. Every Yankee had Strawberry's 
No. 39 on the back of his cap. But when the game ended and Strawberry 
was alone, all that was left was tension. ``I probably will be very 
emotional going in tonight, laying in the hospital,'' Strawberry said 
in a interview broadcast Friday evening on ESPN. ``This is my biggest 
challenge that I have to face. Right now, I'm probably not thinking 
about it because so many things are happening so fast. But I know 
there's going to come a point where I'm going to start thinking and 
I'm going to start asking God: `What's going on? Where am I?' I'm 
not going to ask Him why. But I know I'm going to have a lot of thoughts 
going through me.'' The Strawberrys sat on a couch during the television 
interview, looking as composed as a couple could look after having 
cancer thrust into their lives. The 36-year-old Strawberry has endured 
marital problems, substance abuse and tax woes in his 15-year career, 
but he pledged strength. ``I know everything is going to be OK,'' 
he said firmly. ``I have a really strong feeling inside that is just 
another hill to have to climb.'' That is the same type of resolve 
Strawberry showed during the 45-second message that the Yankees viewed 
about two hours before the first pitch. The team huddled around a 
big-screen television in the clubhouse and listened to Strawberry 
say that he loved them and that he was looking forward to the surgery. 
While pointing his finger at the camera and smiling, Strawberry finished 
by saying: ``Go get 'em tonight, guys. Get 'em.'' Joe Torre, who included 
Strawberry's name in the roster for Friday night's lineup card, said, 
``When he said that, everyone broke up laughing.'' After Strawberry 
made the Yankees chuckle, they sauntered into the dugout like a long-forgotten 
band from the 1980s: Men Without Hats. None of the Yankees wore caps 
during the pre-game workouts because a tailor was embroidering 39s. 
Mostly, Strawberry disguised his emotions on television. But there 
were a few moments when Strawberry wiped at tears, like when his wife 
talked about the phone call she had received from an unnamed friend. 
``She said: `Don't let him get down. God has chosen him to reach other 
people for this because of who he is,''' Charisse Strawberry recalled. 
At one point, Strawberry stared up and said he did not know why God 
had chosen him to be stricken with colon cancer. But he quickly added 
that he was thankful to be alive and to be able to talk candidly about 
overcoming adversity. Even though doctors have told Strawberry he 
should recover fully and return to play next season, he said he would 
be content with his career if he never swung a bat again.
