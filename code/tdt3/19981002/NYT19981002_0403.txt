The materials released Friday by the House Judiciary Committee come 
from the boxes of evidence that Kenneth Starr sent to Congress four 
weeks ago to support the case for impeaching President Clinton. On 
Sept. 9, two vans drove up to the Capitol to deliver two duplicate 
18-box sets of evidence collected by Starr, the Whitewater independent 
counsel. Two days later, before any lawmakers had seen the evidence, 
the House voted to release the material to the public by Sept. 28, 
and made available the first of the 18 boxes, summarizing possible 
``grounds for impeachment'': perjury, obstruction of justice, witness 
tampering and abuse of authority. On Sept. 21, the committee released 
a second box of evidence, including videotapes of Clinton's testimony 
before a federal grand jury. On the same day, Congress issued the 
transcripts of grand jury testimony by Monica Lewinsky, the former 
White House intern with whom Clinton had an affair. On Friday, the 
committee released the remaining 16 boxes of the evidence, including 
testimony by Secret Service agents, friends of Ms. Lewinsky, friends 
of Clinton and White House officials. The new materials also include 
transcripts of telephone conversations between Ms. Lewinsky and her 
former friend Linda Tripp. The transcripts, like some of the other 
documents released Friday, had been heavily edited by the committee 
to protect personal privacy or national security, to eliminate explicit 
``sexual descriptions'' and to delete certain ``expletives.'' Many 
would-be readers found it difficult to use the documents in the form 
disseminated on Friday. The Government Printing Office issued the 
evidence in a three-volume set, but some volumes were missing from 
some sets. Much of the grand jury testimony was printed in type so 
tiny that it was difficult to read. The transcripts were ``condensed'' 
so that four to six pages of transcript would fit on one page of the 
book made available to the public.
