SATURDAY'S KEY GAMES No. 25 Penn State 3-0 No. 1 at Ohio State 3-0 
This Big Ten opener could decide the conference champion. Penn State's 
good defense faces an offense that gained 531 yards last Saturday 
against Missouri. As Coach Joe Paterno of Penn State said, ``We're 
playing one of the best football teams I've seen in 50 years, simple 
as that.'' No. 18 Georgia 3-0 No. 7 at Louisiana State 3-0 Georgia 
has the tightest scoring defense in Division I-A, allowing only 15 
points in three games. Louisiana State is an offensive powerhouse, 
as witness last week's rout of Idaho with 533 yards in total offense 
in less than 23 1/2 minutes of possession. No. 3 Tennessee 3-0 No. 
17 Auburn 1-2 After Tennessee beat Houston last week with 589 yards 
in total offense, Coach Kim Helton of Houston said, ``They're a lot 
tougher than UCLA.'' Auburn, beaten by Louisiana State and Virginia, 
both highly ranked, is the best losing team in the nation. No. 2 Nebraska 
4-0 No. 16 vs Oklahoma State 2-1 at Kansas City, Mo. Both can move 
the ball, but Nebraska's running game (334 yards against Washington 
last week) could make this a runaway. EAST No. 4 West Virginia (2-1) 
at Navy (1-2) West Virginia should cruise against Navy's shaky defense. 
Miami (2-1) at Rutgers (2-2) Rutgers, after upsetting Army, seems 
headed for another losing streak. SOUTH No. 14 Florida (3-1) at Alabama 
(2-1) Florida, with rotating quarterbacks, rolled up 582 yards last 
week in beating Kentucky. Army (1-2) at East Carolina (2-1) Army struggles 
even when it rolls up yards on the ground. MIDWEST Texas A&AMP;M (3-1) 
at Kansas (2-2) Quarterback Randy McCown takes over Texas A&AMP;M's 
anemic offense. Michigan (2-2) at Iowa (2-2) Michigan can get to 6-2 
before facing Penn State, Wisconsin and Ohio State. Stanford (1-3) 
at Notre Dame (2-1) Coach Bob Davie of Notre Dame said, ``Right now, 
we're not a good team. We are plodding along.'' SOUTHWEST No. 19 Kentucky 
(3-1) vs. No. 23 Arkansas (3-0) Kentucky, first in the nation in total 
offense (541.5 yards a game) and first in passing (435.8), will need 
it all. No. 11 Colorado (4-0) at Oklahoma (2-1) A good test for Colorado, 
which got a scare from Baylor. Vanderbilt (0-3) at No. 13 Texas Christian 
(2-1) Vanderbilt, outscored by 104-13, must still face Georgia, Florida, 
Kentucky and Tennessee. FAR WEST No. 24 Arizona (4-0) at No. 20 Washington 
(2-1) Washington is better than it showed in a 55-7 beating from Nebraska, 
but its offense has been dormant. Washington State (3-1) at No. 21 
UCLA (2-0) Washington State's defense is good. UCLA's offense is better. 
Arizona State (2-2) at Southern California (3-1) Southern California 
has a good defense, but an insecure passing game. MISMATCHES No. 6 
Florida State (3-1) at Maryland (2-2) Florida State held Southern 
California to three pass completions. San Jose State (2-2) at No. 
10 Virginia (4-0) Virginia's defense collected eight turnovers against 
Duke. Rankings by The New York Times computer.
