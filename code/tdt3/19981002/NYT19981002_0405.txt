Elaine Benson, whose gallery in Bridgehampton, N.Y., was a fixture 
on the East End summer art scene for more than three decades, died 
Sept. 28 at her home in Bridgehampton. She was 74 and died of non-Hodgkins 
lymphoma, her family said. Elaine Klebanoff was born in Philadelphia 
in 1924. She earned a bachelor's degree in political science from 
the University of Pennsylvania and in 1942 married Warren Goff, a 
law student who became a lighting consultant. She worked as a reporter 
for The Philadelphia Inquirer and as public relations director of 
the Philadelphia Museum College of Art, now called the Philadelphia 
College of Art. There she met her second husband, Emmanuel Benson, 
an art historian and educator. They married in 1963 and in 1965 moved 
to Bridgehampton where they opened an art gallery in their home, a 
Victorian gingerbread on Route 27. The gallery, which ultimately expanded 
to include seven interconnected barns and outbuildings on the property, 
was open from May through September. For many on the East End, its 
annual opening in early May represented the beginning of the summer 
season. Exhibitions focused on the work of artists living full or 
part time in the East End, a fairly impressive pool of candidates 
by any standard. Among those who had solo shows at the gallery were 
Lee Krasner, Jimmy Ernst, Sid Solomon, Larry Rivers, Bob Dash, Alfonso 
Ossorio, James Brooks, Polly Kraft and Bill King. But in many ways 
the sprawling group show that juxtaposed the work of artists young 
and old, famous and not, was more representative of the gallery's 
character. A world traveler, Mrs. Benson also had shows of wall-hangings 
from Pakistan, pre-Columbian sculpture, African sculptures, Jain manuscripts 
and Indian thankas. To support the gallery, Mrs. Benson worked as 
director of community relations at Southampton Hospital for 25 years. 
She contributed articles to Craft Horizon and other publications and 
beginning in 1966 wrote a weekly column for Dan's Papers, never missing 
a week even when she was out of town. Her last column, which discussed 
her illness, was printed Thursday. In her spare time, she raised funds 
for several East End causes and institutions, from the Animal Rescue 
Fund to the John Steinbeck Writers' Room at the Southampton campus 
of Long Island University. Mr. Benson died in 1971, and in 1974 Mrs. 
Benson married Joseph Kaufman, a historian and bibliographer who died 
in 1995. She is survived by her brother, Steven Klebanoff of Rye, 
N.Y.; two sons, William Goff of Kent, Conn. and Neal Goff of Manhattan; 
two daughters, Ginny Goff Green of Loveladies, N.J., and Kimberly 
Goff of Bridgehampton; a brother, Steven Klebanoff of Rye, and three 
grandchildren.
