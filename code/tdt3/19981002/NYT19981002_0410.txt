Bill Clinton seems to have generated the most petitions, calling for 
him to be impeached, to resign, to be left alone. Thirteen people 
have signed one demanding a ban on tigers and other exotic cats as 
pets. Eight favor the establishment of areas in national parks for 
nudists. But a petition demanding statehood for New York City attracted 
not a single signatory, not one, not even Donald Trump. In that dark 
epoch between the discovery of fire and the discovery of the World 
Wide Web, the Bolsheviks had to storm the Winter Palace to get their 
point across. Now it can all be done with the gentle click of a mouse 
button. ``I got the idea when I was sitting at home in Austin watching 
a city council debate on cable television,'' Alex Sheshunoff, 24, 
said. ``The issue they were discussing was very important, but the 
debate was really boring, enough to induce narcolepsy. I started wondering: 
How can you get citizens involved in the democratic process when they 
don't have time to spend three hours at a city council meeting waiting 
to make a three-minute statement?'' His answer: E-The People, which 
describes itself as ``America's Interactive Town Hall'' and resides 
in cyberspace at www.e-thepeople.com. Those who find their way to 
the Web site, either directly or through one of the newspapers or 
nonprofit agencies that are Sheshunoff's partners, are given the chance 
to sign a petition already posted on the site, create a new petition 
or write a letter to government officials about whatever is stuck 
in their craw. ``There have been a lot of people talking recently 
about the intersection of democracy and the Internet,'' Sheshunoff 
said, ``but not a lot of people sitting down and writing the code. 
That's where we come in.'' E-The People has been open since August 
but is still trying to ``stomp out the last of the bugs,'' Sheshunoff 
said, and should be fully operational in a month or so. The Web site, 
which also bills itself as ``an Alex Sheshunoff Initiative,'' is designed 
to connect citizens with their government officials, local or national, 
and to turn a profit for Sheshunoff and his investors. For example, 
a Houston resident interested in protesting about the environment 
is led through a process of identifying whom he should contact (a 
click calls up a list that includes the governor, lieutenant governor, 
city council representative, 26 state representatives, eight state 
senators and 20 agency officials with specific responsibility for 
the environment). Then the resident can compose a message that is 
automatically sent as e-mail to whichever officials are selected, 
or as a fax, if the recipient has no e-mail address. It is all free 
for the petitioners and letter writers. Advertisers and media partners 
pay the freight. Messages can also be sent to the White House or to 
Congress, Sheshunoff said, but the central intent is to address local 
issues. ``The president already received a half-million e-mails a 
month, but for a city council member to receive 10 letters on a single 
subject can have a real impact,'' he said. ``This is really about 
local people solving local problems.'' The letters are treated as 
private mail, Sheshunoff said. E-The People takes no note of their 
content and promises it will sell none of the demographic data that 
might be collected in the process. Sheshunoff's initiative operates 
from an office on the 19th floor of a tower in downtown Austin, part 
of a suite of offices that are home to Alex Sheshunoff Management 
Services, the company run by his father, a well-known banking consultant. 
The younger Sheshunoff prowled his small room recently, a thatch of 
sandy hair brushing his forehead, occasionally grabbing for a purring 
cellular telephone while a team of young programmers hunched over 
keyboards frantically tapping in data. An American flag dominated 
one wall while a map of the United States filled another, showing 
the route of an 80-city transcontinental bus tour that Sheshunoff 
has been running to spread the word. The bus, decorated to resemble 
a mailbox, left Austin on Aug. 1 and has made its way across the Southwest, 
up the Pacific Coast and across the prairies into the Midwest, New 
England and New York. It is heading south on its return to Texas. 
So far, 45 newspapers have agreed to go into partnership with E-The 
People, meaning they will feature a link to the site on their own 
Web pages and share with E-The People any advertising revenues generated 
by surfers traversing that link. Among those signed up are The San 
Antonio Express-News, The Oregonian in Portland and The Daily News 
in New York. Sheshunoff is hoping for 100 media partners. Sheshunoff 
once considered a career in network television. While a student at 
Yale, he did some work for ABC News, as a production assistant and 
then reading his own short, personal essays in the wee hours. Then 
he read somewhere that the audience for network television news had 
dropped 30 percent since 1990. Sheshunoff said he spent his senior 
year ``thinking about where news was going.'' This led him, as it 
has hundreds of others in his generation, to the Internet. His first 
effort was an online magazine developed as a way of allowing readers 
to pinpoint the restaurants and other venues nearest their homes. 
``We sold some of that underlying technology to newspapers and others, 
for their Web pages,'' he said. A similar process is used in E-The 
People, he said, but it is more sophisticated. ``It's not as easy 
as it sounds,'' he said, ``to take somebody's address and tell them 
who their elected officials are.''
