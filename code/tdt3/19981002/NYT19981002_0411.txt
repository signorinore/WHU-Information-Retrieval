The Cleveland Indians' general manager, John Hart, and manager, Mike 
Hargrove, had been stern about the subject. Their players had been 
silly about it, kidding their teammate Manny Ramirez, the club's young 
power hitter, about going into his home run jog on balls that stayed 
in the park. Whatever the approach, Ramirez got the message: no more 
posing and sauntering up the first-base line while watching one of 
his well-hit balls make its way toward the outfield bleachers. His 
lesson learned, Ramirez sprinted toward first every time he made contact 
with a pitch Friday in Game 3 of the American League division series 
against the Boston Red Sox _ even though he didn't have to. The Indians' 
right fielder knocked two balls out of Fenway Park, the second of 
which turned out to be the game winner, leading Cleveland to a 4-3 
victory and a 2-1 edge in this three-of-five-games series that continues 
here with Game 4 Saturday. ``I was just trying to run hard,'' Ramirez 
said when he was asked about his new base-running tactics. ``They 
bring a lot of young guys up from Triple-A, and some of them look 
up to me. If they see me jogging, they may want to do that too.'' 
That revelation did not apparently hit Ramirez until Thursday, because 
in Games 1 and 2 this week, he trotted and watched long base hits 
that appeared to be heading out of Jacobs Field. But Friday's solo 
shots off Bret Saberhagen and Dennis Eckersley left no doubt about 
their destination. In the seventh inning, Ramirez tagged a Saberhagen 
fastball an estimated 388 feet over Fenway's Green Monster, and in 
the ninth, off Eckersley, he drilled a homer that looked as if it 
had been shot out of a cannon. The final shot, Ramirez's franchise-record 
11th in the postseason, gave Cleveland a 4-1 lead and the insurance 
it needed after Boston scored two runs in their last at-bat against 
reliever Mike Jackson. Hart, obviously pleased with the victory, was 
also pleased that Ramirez had listened to him. ``He made sure there 
was no doubt today, especially on that second one,'' Hart said. ``He 
didn't have time to trot on that one; it was out of the park before 
he was out of the batter's box.'' Ramirez's homers were only two of 
Cleveland's four on the day, the others being solo shots from Jim 
Thome in the fifth and Kenny Lofton in the sixth. Thome's homer tied 
the score at 1-1 and was Cleveland's first hit off of Saberhagen. 
The Boston right-hander pitched a solid seven innings, but three of 
the four hits he allowed were home runs. Cleveland managed only five 
hits in the game. ``It was just a matter of a couple of pitches that 
got too much of the plate,'' Saberhagen said. ``That's a little tough 
to swallow.'' Saberhagen waged a nice war, the first pitchers' duel 
of this series, with Charles Nagy, who allowed just four hits and 
one run in eight innings. The control Nagy exhibited over the Red 
Sox came as no surprise as he improved his career record against Boston 
to 8-1, including 2-0 in the postseason. Nagy struck out just three 
batters, but he kept Boston's hitters off balance with a sinker that 
seemingly disappeared inches in front of the plate, a darting slider 
and a split-fingered fastball. He had excellent control, throwing 
62 strikes in 88 pitches, and his ball movement forced hitters into 
13 groundouts. ``When a pitcher's out there and gets all of his pitches 
over the plate and throws strikes with his off-speed pitches, he's 
going to be tough to hit,'' said Boston's John Valentin, who was 1-for-4 
with two groundouts. The Red Sox are now facing elimination, and the 
fans and local news media are clamoring for Red Sox Manager Jimy Williams 
to start his star pitcher Pedro Martinez. Martinez has controlled 
the Indians all season and struck out eight in his Game 1 victory. 
Williams, however, is determined to go with the scheduled starter 
Pete Schourek (1-3, 4.30 earned run average).
