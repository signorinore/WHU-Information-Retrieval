As NATO and the United States warned again of impending military action 
against Serbia, several influential Republican senators Friday criticized 
the Clinton administration's approach toward ending the crisis in 
Kosovo. The criticism came as the president's top national security 
aides held a second day of confidential briefings on Capitol Hill 
about how NATO will respond if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
does not halt the violence against ethnic Albanian civilians in the 
province. Milosevic must agree to remove his special police forces 
from Kosovo, to permit aid to 300,000 refugees and to begin serious 
negotiations toward a political settlement, U.S. officials said. If 
he does not, lawmakers said the plan is for U.S.-dominated NATO forces 
to fire cruise missiles at Serbian targets in Kosovo. If that failed, 
NATO warplanes would wage sustained air strikes against a wide range 
of targets in Serbia itself, senators said Friday. Defense Secretary 
William Cohen said Friday that if NATO agreed on air strikes, the 
attacks would begin within two weeks. But many Senate Republicans 
were unimpressed with the briefing they received Thursday from Cohen, 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, National Security Adviser Samuel 
Berger and Gen. Joseph Ralston, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff. ``They have a lot of work to do if they're going to convince 
the Congress,'' Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Republican whip, 
said on the Senate floor. Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., who heads the 
Budget Committee, said, ``They didn't have a very good plan.'' Sen. 
Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, 
said, ``This is an extremely complex issue, but it is clear that the 
planning on the part of the administration is inadequate.'' Overall, 
the sentiment in Congress is more complicated. Several Republicans, 
including Gordon Smith of Oregon, John McCain of Arizona and Mitch 
McConell of Kentucky, as well as Democrats including Minority Leader 
Tom Daschle and Joseph Biden of Delaware, have expressed support for 
air strikes to end the killings. Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a member 
of the Armed Services Committee, said air strikes were futile unless 
ground forces _ composed of European troops _ followed up to protect 
the delivery of aid and prevent renewed armed clashes. But at the 
briefings, lawmakers said Clinton's aides pointedly avoided discussing 
the possibility of ground forces. Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., said Berger 
indicated that NATO would not send ground troops until the warring 
parties negotiated a solution. A series of widely publicized atrocities 
against ethnic Albanians that have been attributed to Serbian forces 
have increased pressure on the administration to follow through on 
its threats of reprisal. This week's briefings were the first of many 
contentious consultations with the administration on the crisis in 
Kosovo. ``We're saying this to the administration so they'll shape 
up,'' said Lugar. The president and his top aides continued to push 
for a diplomatic settlement while threatening air strikes if talks 
fail. ``We have to be very, very strong here,'' President Clinton 
said Friday. ``We need to stop this violence, get a negotiated settlement, 
and work our way through this.'' Cohen told reporters after briefing 
House members Friday, ``He must accept the entire set of demands, 
otherwise he will face use of force.'' But Congress is demanding that 
the administration gain Congress' blessing in advance for any military 
action. Many Republicans still feel Clinton misled them on the scope, 
cost and duration of the U.S.-led mission in Bosnia, and are wary 
of being drawn into the same open-ended commitment in Kosovo. Clinton's 
aides say they welcome congressional support but do not require it.
