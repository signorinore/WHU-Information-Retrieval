MIAMI _ ``I'm hanging around and checking out the city.'' That was 
the first _ and possibly the most accurate _ explanation that New 
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani gave when reporters asked what exactly 
he was doing during a three-day trip to Miami, which he announced 
at the last minute Tuesday night. Although Giuliani met with Miami 
Mayor Joe Carollo and a Cuban-American political group Thursday and 
spoke at a fund-raiser for the Republican National Committee on Friday, 
he apparently devoted most of the trip, paid for by the committee, 
to leisure. Not that the mayor would admit it. His aides brushed aside 
questions about how he was spending his time, some pleading ignorance 
and others saying nobody needed to know. At first, only Carollo would 
confirm what everyone suspected: Rudy Giuliani, the never-resting, 
uptight urban tough, was sneaking in some rounds of golf. Giuliani 
finally said Friday night that he had indeed been golfing for two 
sunny, sweltering days, although he would not reveal his handicap. 
He started playing last May, he said, because his son, Andrew, was 
interested in the sport. ``I'm not going to tell you where I played 
because you might go check my score,'' he said after speaking to 125 
people who had paid $500 to hear him list his political accomplishments 
at the Westin Hotel in Fort Lauderdale. ``I enjoy it.'' A Reverent 
Tone to the Day Giuliani probably also enjoyed listening to the various 
people he met in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, since they spoke of him 
in terms best described as reverent. ``It's a great day when the City 
of Miami can host someone with the courage, the integrity, the guts, 
if I may say, to have turned so many things around in New York,'' 
Carollo, a fellow Republican, said as he introduced Giuliani at a 
news conference on Thursday at city offices. ``He has made New York 
an example to the rest of the country, and indeed the world.'' Jorge 
Mas Canosa, vice chairman of the Cuban American National Foundation, 
was equally enthusiastic after Giuliani addressed members of his group 
later that afternoon. In a brief speech, the mayor denounced Fidel 
Castro and told his audience they represented ``the very, very best 
of the American spirit'' because they were ``trying to produce freedom 
and independence for people.'' ``He's a man of principal, a man of 
courage and a man who helps and assists those who fight for freedom,'' 
said Mas, who said his group had urged Giuliani to come meet with 
them. ``He's a friend of democracy and liberty.'' Carollo, who met 
Giuliani for the first time over breakfast Thursday, said the mayor 
was nothing like he had expected. Rudy Giuliani was warm, he said, 
and kind. ``I found him just a very warm, very average type of person,'' 
Carollo said. ``You feel good with him. You would think that the mayor 
of the world's capital is going to be a little more cold, some might 
think more arrogant. I didn't find that in Giuliani.'' A Chance to 
Boast As he has done in almost every other state where he has appeared 
at a fund-raiser, Giuliani greeted the Republican donors at the Westin 
Hotel in Fort Lauderdale on Friday evening with his ``Godfather'' 
imitation. He then spoke for 20 minutes about how the crime rate and 
welfare rolls have dropped in New York City under his leadership. 
Republican National Committee chairman Jim Nicholson stood by and 
nodded approvingly as Giuliani spouted statistics and said that New 
Yorkers were much better off than they were six years ago. ``Five 
or six years ago they were afraid to go out and about,'' Giuliani 
said. ``Five or six years ago they were afraid to go to Broadway. 
They were afraid to go to the Waldorf-Astoria, much less to the areas 
of the city that were considered to be more dangerous. Today, New 
Yorkers feel free. They feel more independent.'' Nicholson said all 
of the money raised at the fund-raiser would go to Republican candidates 
running for office this fall, and Giuliani did not mention any plans 
he might have for higher office. But Ed Kone, a criminal-defense lawyer 
from Boca Raton who was in the audience, appeared ready to join a 
Giuliani presidential campaign. ``I think Al Gore had better watch 
out, because it's going to be a man against a boy if it's him against 
Giuliani,'' Kone, 36, said. Asked if Giuliani might come across as 
too abrasive in some parts of the country, Kone shook his head vigorously. 
``No way,'' he said. ``People totally love that.'' A Tour of Hurricane 
Damage Lurking in the back of the room at the fund-raiser were Police 
Commissioner Howard Safir and Jerome Hauer, the director of the mayor's 
Office of Emergency Management, who will accompany Giuliani on Saturday 
to the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, where they will meet politicians 
and survey the damage caused by Hurricane Georges. Giuliani is scheduled 
to meet with President Leonel Fernandez in the morning, then take 
a helicopter tour of hurricane-ravaged areas before flying to San 
Juan in the late afternoon. He will probably return to New York on 
Sunday morning, said Cristyne Lategano, his director of communications. 
``We're really going to be guided by them, what we can do to help,'' 
said Giuliani, who has already sent several dozen city police officers 
and firefighters to assist relief efforts in the Dominican Republic. 
The mayor is not the first New York City politician to travel to the 
hurricane-ravaged regions _ Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia 
Fields and U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, both Democrats, went earlier 
this week. But the mayor, who rarely has kind words for either Ms. 
Fields or Rangel, said he found nothing wrong with them visiting, 
too. ``Those are not necessarily politicians I agree with philosophically, 
but the fact that they're going is a good thing,'' he said. ``It means 
people who are more supportive of them are going to pay more attention 
to the Dominican Republic.''
