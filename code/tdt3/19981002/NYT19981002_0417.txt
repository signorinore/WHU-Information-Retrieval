Television coverage of the release of documents from the office of 
Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr on Friday was far more 
restrained on every channel than either the day the original Starr 
report was released or the day President Clinton's videotaped testimony 
was made available. None of the major broadcast networks interrupted 
their usual programs for live reports on the documents, and all three 
major networks planned to devote much of the first segments of their 
newscasts to coverage of the economy rather than news coming out of 
the documents. No network planned any prime-time coverage, though 
ABC did schedule it as the subject of its ``Nightline'' program. Three 
all-news cable channels devoted most of their afternoon coverage to 
the documents. But in contrast to both other days when the coverage 
was continuous, CNN used several of its regular features, including 
a ``Show Biz Today'' report, and Fox News did an interview concerning 
the health of Darryl Strawberry, the New York Yankee outfielder who 
has colon cancer. Fox News did the earliest report on the release 
of the document, obtaining copies a few minutes earlier than other 
news organizations. An executive at one of the news channels said: 
``The level of intensity is way down. People have mostly made up their 
minds on this story.''
