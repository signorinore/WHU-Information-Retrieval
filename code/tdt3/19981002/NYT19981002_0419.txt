Where's the Bottom? It May Not Be Here Yet For investors who hope 
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index won't revisit its Aug. 31 
low, last week's 4.0 percent selloff seemed to be the market's surly 
way of saying: ``Don't be so sure.'' And there are more bearish tidings 
on the technical front. One recent negative is that the S&AMP;P 500, 
which has moved upward in a narrow channel since the end of 1994, 
has pierced its lower trend line, where the index in the past found 
the support that allowed it to keep climbing. Worse, Mark D. Arbeter, 
chief technical analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's, says it is unlikely 
that the index can maintain the annual gains of 24 percent that are 
needed to keep it in the bullish channel. He called Friday's market 
upturn ``semi-positive,'' but added, ``We're not out of the woods 
yet.'' If two events occur _ an increase in bearish sentiment among 
investment advisers from the current 47.5 percent to around 55 percent 
and a contraction of new lows on the New York Stock Exchange _ ``it 
will confirm we have had a bottom, he said. He does not expect the 
market to move back to its old highs until well into 1999. Chart makers 
aren't the only ones trying to call a market low. Rao Chalasani, chief 
investment strategist of Everen Securities in Chicago, puts ``the 
ultimate bottom'' in the 7,000-to-7,500 range for the Dow Jones industrial 
average. Stocks may revisit the 7,400 level of Sept. 1, he said, and 
quite possibly go lower. The Dow closed at 7,784.69 on Friday. Edward 
Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, said, ``While 
the recent bear market action has been very painful, I think it is 
just a warm-up act for a much more serious and protracted drop in 
stock prices in 1999,'' when global recession is likely to spread. 
He thus recommends using any stock rally as a selling opportunity. 
Jan M. Rosen FUNDS WATCH Now Is the Time the Bears Have Their Picnic 
When the market turns bearish, the bears are the winners. So, given 
the market's recent mauling, it should come as no surprise that the 
top performer of 8,160 American funds tracked by Bloomberg Fund Performance 
in the third quarter was the Prudent Bear fund. Prudent Bear, which 
climbed 22.7 percent, is part of the only group of stock funds that 
gained over the last three months _ those that bet against the market 
by short-selling stocks, using futures and options and buying bonds. 
The No. 2 fund in the survey was Profunds Ultra Bear, up 18.7 percent. 
Over all, domestic stock funds fell 13.4 percent in the quarter, erasing 
all their gains from the first half of the year, according to researchers 
at Morningstar Inc. The last time funds did so poorly was in the third 
quarter of 1990, when they fell an average of 14.6 percent after Iraq 
invaded Kuwait. (Bloomberg News) Solace for Managers Of Small-Company 
Funds September, alas, brought no relief for investors in small-company 
stocks. The Russell 2000 index, a barometer for such stocks, fell 
20.5 percent during the month, almost twice the 10.3 percent drop 
in the S&AMP;P 500 index. And the average ``small growth'' stock mutual 
fund declined 22.5 percent in the third quarter and is down 16.8 percent 
for the year, according to Morningstar Inc. ``To say that they're 
ripe for a rally is such an understatement,'' said Claudia E. Mott, 
director of small-cap research for Prudential Securities. Fundamentals 
and profits have been strong for months, she said, and valuations 
continue to make the stocks look attractive. Yet betting on small 
caps now is ``risk-taking in a dicey market,'' Ms. Mott said. ``I 
don't think people are going to be willing to take the risk'' until 
larger stocks rebound. What to do? Well, the empathetic Ms. Mott wants 
to console managers of small-cap funds, so she made up 1,000 bumper 
stickers asking, ``Have you hugged your small-cap manager today?'' 
Customers have scooped them up, and more are being printed. Sharon
