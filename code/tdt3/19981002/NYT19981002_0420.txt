Robert Lee Gill, a longtime member of the New York Stock Exchange 
and a prominent collector of American antiques, died on Sept. 24 at 
his home in Manhattan. He was 87. Gill was born in South Orange, N.J., 
in 1911 and educated at Choate. He joined Shields &AMP; Co. in 1932 
and in the late 1940s formed a company with three other members of 
the Stock Exchange, but for most of his career he worked independently. 
During the 1930s and '40s he was a prominent member of cafe society 
whose friends included Barbara Hutton and Howard Hughes. Gill's interest 
in Americana began at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he was 
a weekly visitor to the American collection from the time it opened, 
in 1927, until his death. In the late 1930s he began collecting first-edition 
books and Currier &AMP; Ives prints. He also made regular visits to 
the Upper East Side gallery of Israel Sack, a dealer in Americana 
and American antiques, eventually becoming part of the then small 
world of serious collectors of American antiques that included Henry 
Ford, Henry Francis du Pont and Ima Hogg. In 1942, Gill bought his 
first antique, a lowboy once owned by John Hancock. Over the next 
few decades he formed an exceptional collection of primarily 17th- 
and 18th-century Boston, federal and Newport furniture. He was known 
for his eye and the beautiful arrangement of the collection in his 
apartment, which also included a widely admired kitchen that was lined 
floor to ceiling with 16th- and 17th-century Dutch tile. In the late 
1980s, Gill also began collecting Chinese porcelain. In the 1970s, 
the U.S. government bought two pieces from his collection _ a small 
painting of the White House under construction and a late federal 
card table _ that are still on display in the White House. Last year 
Gill endowed a research fellow scholarship at the Henry Francis du 
Pont Winterthur Museum in Delaware. Gill's first wife, Caroline Townsend 
Chapman Gill, whom he married in 1939, died in 1984. He is survived 
by his wife, Melanie; a son from his first marriage, Peter Gill of 
Bronxville, and a stepson, Jack Chapman of Fort Pierce, Fla.
