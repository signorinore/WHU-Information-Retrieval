They're twins. They're thin. They're attractively employed, talented, 
a little vague about their past and, according to one admirer, ``hugely 
in demand right now.'' Oh, and one other thing: They're English. Meet 
Plum and Lucy Sykes, 29-year-old magazine darlings, and the latest 
in the stream of non-celebrity somebodies who flood the city's fashion 
ponds from one season to the next. They're not identical, but they 
think alike on many subjects. They agree, for instance, that it would 
be ``rather sad'' to be young and single with a VCR in Manhattan. 
Why rent movies when life resembles ``Breakfast at Tiffany's'' and 
``Absolutely Fabulous'' every day? ``I look at the Sykes sisters,'' 
said Sally Singer, the fashion editor at New York Magazine, ``and 
I think: OK, my ancestors were born to work in the fields, and theirs 
were born to walk into parties.'' The Oxford-educated Plum, the brunette 
one, spins out witty articles as a staff writer for Vogue about the 
high-maintenance beauty regimens of New Yorkers, like trying on stilettos 
and having lingerie custom-made. Anna Wintour, her boss, said that 
Plum ``lives the ideal Vogue life,'' and that she's the ``quintessential 
Vogue girl.'' The quintessential Vogue girl? What does that entail? 
It means owning dresses that Alexander McQueen made for you when he 
was too poor to have a checking account. It means being an out-and-about 
embodiment of quirky style, having Kate Moss-like hair and Versace 
sunglasses that you got free from a runway show. If it also means 
an inability to remember faces because you've met too many people, 
or occasionally snubbing someone who seems less than interesting, 
well, that comes with the position, too. Lucy, a brassy bottle-blonde, 
who attended acting school but never went to college, is living a 
life that's almost as Town &AMP; Country as her sister's life is Vogue. 
As the fashion editor of Town &AMP; Country, she scouts for good-looking, 
accomplished people to use as models, and after just a few years in 
New York, she is ending up on benefit committees and in society columns 
with them. ``Lucy's got great taste and wonderful energy,'' said Pamela 
Fiori, editor in chief of Town &AMP; Country. ``Also, she's tall, 
blond and charming, with the most adorable English accent. All New 
Yorkers have a weakness for people with English accents.'' Unless 
it's Madonna's, of course. The Sykes sisters are among the most visible 
on a list of single, young Englishwomen working it in New York right 
now _ lionized in a small world, unknown to the general public. Violet 
Fraser, Daisy Garnett, Zandy Forbes, Vicky Ward, Miranda Brooks _ 
the list is refreshed by the day, as it has been for years. ``Everybody's 
being so nice to me,'' Plum Sykes said. ``I feel welcome here wherever 
I go. It's probably just because of my job, but I don't care.'' It 
was Friday night at the end of September's Fashion Week, and the Sykes 
sisters were giving dinners around the corner from each other at two 
different restaurants in Greenwich Village. With its old brick low-rise 
neighborhoods, Greenwich Village has become, of late, a sort of Little 
London for the crowd of fashionable English people thriving in the 
democratic meritocracy of Manhattan, where a title is nice to have 
but not as good as a spokesmodel contract or a Conde Nast expense 
account. Streets that were once home to writers and radicals have 
now become home to such mercenary media luminaries as Ms. Wintour, 
Kate Moss, James Truman, Rupert Everett, Stella Tennant, Hamish Bowles, 
Gabe Doppelt and, of course, the Sykes sisters. ``I'm intimidated 
by high-rises,'' said Plum as she emerged from Piadina, on West Tenth 
Street. ``But Greenwich Village is like the mews of London.'' She 
had been presiding over a table of 10 of her attractive, successful 
English friends and was about to hail a cab when she realized that 
the block and a half to Moomba wasn't too far to walk, even in high-heeled, 
Sergio Rossi sandals. Minutes later, in her tight, red velvet dress 
by Ghost with a cigarette burn in front (``It's from Anna's party 
for Oprah at Balthazar,'' she said. ``All my clothes get trashed.''), 
she paused at a velvet rope. ``How are you?'' was all it took from 
Ms. Sykes, who has modeled for Prada, to melt the big Moomba-bouncer 
into the sidewalk. ``Come right in,'' he said. Lucy's dinner was just 
breaking up. ``Hello, darling!'' she said. She was holding court downstairs 
at a table in the corner, and now it was time to migrate to the private 
party room on the top floor, where Gene Pressman, recently stripped 
of his title of co-chief executive of Barneys, spotted Lucy and trotted 
over to pay his respects. ``Hello, darling,'' she said in a shrill 
voice that might not be so appealing if it were attached to an American 
accent. ``So nice to see you!'' Lucy calls everyone darling. It's 
part of her shtick. ``I once dated a guy who said that going out with 
me was like being in a Beatles movie,'' she said later. ``I didn't 
have to think of anything clever to say. All I had to do to make him 
laugh was say hello. She also speaks fluent fashionese: ``This is 
my new pony skin bag by Fendi,'' she said to a friend between sips 
of a Kamikaze cocktail. ``Pony skin is so soft! I used to have a puppy, 
but now I have a Fendi bag. It's cheaper than a puppy because you 
don't have to feed it every day.'' After that, she busied herself 
making everyone feel welcome, spraying the room with kisses and yelling 
``Toss my salad!'' every other minute. ``Toss my salad'' translates, 
roughly, as ``Cowabunga!'' English friends, fashion victims, magazine 
writers, cute men _ it seemed the social equivalent of Spin Art. At 
one point, Clifford Streit, the personal-manager-about-town, who works 
the same social swamp as the Sykes sisters, introduced the handsome 
man at his side. ``This is Brian Unger,'' Streit said. ``He's on `The 
Daily Show.''' Lucy had no idea what that meant, so Streit explained 
to her that it was a ``very hot'' show on Comedy Central.
