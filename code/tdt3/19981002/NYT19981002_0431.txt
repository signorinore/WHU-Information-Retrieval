With his neatly trimmed beard and his book-filled offices, Wesley 
McCain, co-manager of the Eclipse Growth and Income fund, looks every 
bit the academic. Indeed, he developed his computer-driven investment 
strategy as an assistant professor of finance at Columbia University's 
graduate business school. But McCain does not pine to return to the 
ivory tower soon. ``I think I graduated from teacher to mentor,'' 
he said. ``I don't miss institutionalized teaching at all.'' His students 
may miss him, but their loss is investors' gain. Since its inception 
in December 1994, McCain's fund has returned 21.9 percent a year, 
on average, through Sept. 25, compared with 16.2 percent for its peers 
in the mid-cap value category, according to Morningstar Inc., the 
Chicago financial publisher. More impressive, the $103.9 million fund 
has nicely weathered the treacherous markets of 1998. It has returned 
2 percent so far this year, compared with a loss of 9.8 percent for 
its category. McCain, 56, and his co-manager, Kathy O'Connor, 38, 
label themselves ``quantitative fundamentalists.'' In quantitative 
investing, managers rely on computer models to help them pick stocks 
instead of, say, interviewing company executives or listening to analysts' 
pitches. ``We visit data, not companies,'' as McCain puts it. Nor 
do the managers rely on earnings estimates or other forecasts; they 
use only historical and current data in their computer models. But 
both managers still call themselves value investors. ``We look for 
stocks that are both good and cheap,'' Ms. O'Connor said. McCain founded 
Towneley Capital Management, sponsor of the four no-load Eclipse funds, 
in 1971, and Ms. O'Connor joined in 1987. With the help of high-speed 
mini-computers, the two review reams of information on more than 7,000 
United States companies. Stocks are ranked by more than 100 measures, 
most of them remarkably simple _ ``all basic Finance 101,'' McCain 
said. The measures fall into two basic categories: those that uncover 
improving operating results and those that determine relative value. 
In the first group are basic measures like profit margin, cash flow, 
leverage and returns on equity and assets. The co-managers then add 
their insights to the mix, ferreting out improving results that are 
not yet apparent to Wall Street analysts or even a company's own management, 
McCain said. For example, a company's earnings before interest and 
taxes may be declining; that is usually seen as a negative when it 
comes to profitability. ``We might look at that company and say, `Margins 
are collapsing, but asset turns are increasing, meaning that management 
is selling off excess or slow-moving inventory,' '' he said. ``Just 
because margins are decreasing doesn't mean a company isn't interesting.'' 
The second type of measures, for value, includes ratios like price 
to sales, price to book and price to cash flow. Again, simple stuff. 
The computer then compares a company's numbers over different periods 
with those of rivals. Unlike many other managers, McCain and Ms. O'Connor 
set no target prices for their holdings. Typically, they hold a stock 
for four quarters, selling only for extraordinary reasons like fraud 
at the company. Depending on its ranking in the model after four quarters, 
a stock may be partly or wholly sold and replaced by a stock with 
better scores. The fund, which owns 110 stocks, in May began buying 
shares of Lyondell Chemical, a specialty chemical company, at $21 
to $27 a share. The operating results showed a sharp improvement. 
Yet by McCain's standards Lyondell is very inexpensive: It sells for 
about 1.2 times its revenue per share for the previous four quarters, 
less than seven times its earnings for the previous four quarters 
and for just 2.5 times book value. It closed at $21.0625 on Friday. 
In early August, the managers bought class A shares in Food Lion, 
the supermarket chain; among the numbers that suggested improving 
profits were receivables, working capital and inventories. The company 
sells for about 0.5 times its revenue for the previous four quarters, 
while Safeway, another chain that the fund bought earlier, sells for 
0.9 times revenue. Eclipse started buying Food Lion at $10 to $11 
a share. It closed at $10 on Friday.
