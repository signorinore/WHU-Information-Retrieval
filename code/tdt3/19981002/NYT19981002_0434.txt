The family of Anthony Baez, who died in a confrontation with a police 
officer in the Bronx in 1994, agreed Friday to a record settlement 
in their lawsuit against the city, but family members still accused 
the city of failing to grapple with police brutality. ``It's a pattern 
of abuse over and over, because nobody stands up to it,'' Iris Baez, 
Baez's mother, said at a news conference after the settlement was 
made formal. The settlement, in which the city will pay the family 
almost $3 million, ends almost a four-year legal battle that began 
with Baez's death after a late-night touch football game with relatives 
on Dec. 22, 1994. A ball struck a police car during the game, prompting 
a confrontation in which police officials and prosecutors said one 
officer, Francis X. Livoti, applied a choke hold to Baez, who was 
29. But while the settlement ended a swarm of suits in the case, relatives 
of Baez continued to express bitterness Friday. ``No apology is worth 
me standing in front of him,'' said Mrs. Baez, when asked about whether 
she wanted an apology from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. ``He should have 
said that from day one.'' The Baez family's lawyers said the settlement 
_ which included no admission of wrongdoing by the city but was the 
largest ever recovered in wrongful death resulting from police brutality 
_ should set a precedent for other police brutality claims. They said 
they hoped the settlement would prompt other brutality victims to 
come forward and would pressure the department to police its errant 
officers more aggressively. ``This is not an aberration,'' said Susan 
M. Karten, a lawyer for the Baezes. ``Every other day we hear another 
incident.'' Ms. Karten acknowledged that the family had hoped to force 
Louis Anemone, the chief of department and highest-ranking uniformed 
officer, to testify about why he turned down a request from a subordinate 
to remove Livoti from patrol after he received nine brutality complaints. 
``We would've wanted the record to come out,'' Ms. Karten said. ``I 
don't think Anemone has ever answered for that.'' Federal prosecutors 
also accused Livoti's fellow officers of lying under oath to protect 
him, and an investigation into possible perjury charges against the 
officers is continuing. The city still faces suits in some other highly 
publicized cases involving police actions. A wrongful death suit filed 
by the family of Nathaniel Levi Gaines Jr., an unarmed Navy veteran 
with no criminal record who was shot in the back by a transit police 
officer on July 4, 1996, as he fled down a deserted Bronx subway platform, 
is still pending. And the case of Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant 
who said he was brutalized last summer in a Brooklyn station house, 
is also pending. But Eugene Borenstein, chief of the tort division 
of Corporation Counsel's office, said the city settled the Baez case 
because the time had come to move forward. ``I think this was a good 
time to dispose of an unfortunate and tragic incident,'' he said. 
``I think all of the parties thought that it was the right time to 
settle the case.'' City officials have long distanced themselves from 
Livoti. Giuliani, usually a vocal supporter of police officers, never 
openly backed him. And Police Commissioner Howard Safir dismissed 
Livoti from the force after a police trial found that he used an illegal 
choke hold on Baez. Linda Cronin, Livoti's lawyer, said Friday that 
her client continued to maintain his innocence. Convicted in June 
on federal charges of violating Baez's civil rights, he will be sentenced 
next week.
