General Electric Co. said Friday that it had no plans to break up 
its star financial services subsidiary, GE Capital, and assured investors 
that it would report double-digit earnings growth in the third quarter. 
Speculation has been rampant that General Electric is planning a shake-up 
at GE Capital, which had about $40 billion in revenue last year. Such 
speculation, as well as the prospects for a reorganization, was the 
subject of the Market Place column Friday in The New York Times. According 
to analysts and others who watch the subsidiary closely, Gary Wendt, 
GE Capital's chief executive, is widely expected to leave. In addition 
to naming new leadership at GE Capital, there is also talk that General 
Electric might divide the subsidiary into different units or fold 
some of the businesses into the parent company. Although GE Capital 
has been a strong contributor to GE's profits, investors are increasingly 
wary of financial service companies and have been awarding them low 
price-earnings multiples. While analysts say that GE Capital is not 
at risk from any unpleasant surprises, a reorganization could help 
divert attention from the subsidiary. In its statement, GE, which 
had previously declined to comment on the speculation, said it had 
``no plans to break up its successful GE Capital Services unit or 
assign any GECS businesses to GE's industrial units.'' GE's chairman, 
John Welch Jr., said the company's current business model ``will continue 
to be the basis for future growth.'' GE stock fell as much as $4.9375, 
or 6.5 percent, Friday before recovering to close down just 18.75 
cents, at $75.375. While Nicholas Heymann, an analyst with Prudential 
Securities, says he believes that there will be no formal corporate 
restructuring, he says he still thinks that GE Capital's businesses 
could be reclassified in some way to increase operating efficiencies. 
None of the changes would be in response to problems at the unit, 
he said. GE ``knows enough about managing people'' that any changes 
at GE Capital will not hurt its strong performance, Heymann said. 
Speculation also continues that GE will announce executive changes 
at GE Capital, following the expected departure of Wendt. In Friday's 
statement, GE reiterated that it had a ``longstanding practice of 
not commenting on speculation about its executives.''
