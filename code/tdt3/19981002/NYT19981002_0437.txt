A lifeless floral wreath hangs over the doorway of Jose Soriano's 
tenement in upper Manhattan. It is the only outward sign of what befell 
his family inside: they held a desperate overnight vigil when he failed 
to come home after his shift at a Brooklyn clothing factory. He never 
returned because he was stabbed to death doing something he loved: 
walking through Central Park. In the days after his killing on Sept. 
19, there were few other signs elsewhere in the city acknowledging 
the cruel end to a Mexican immigrant's hard life. Soriano originally 
was described by the police, incorrectly, as homeless, as if that 
would excuse the absence of outrage. Inside his very real home, friends 
and family felt forgotten. They suspected that people did not care 
about the deaths of those who live north of the boundary of class 
and concern otherwise known as East 96th Street. But something happened 
soon after his widow, Fausta, described to this columnist the love 
her husband had for this city and her sadness at the public's apathy 
over his murder. Scores of people sought her out. Hundreds called 
and wrote to the Rev. Bruce Lewandowski, who had lamented the uncomfortable 
reality that the lives of invisible immigrants did not count. Mrs. 
Soriano and her three children are invisible no more. Nor are the 
136 New Yorkers who donated more than $20,000 to help the family bury 
the dead and comfort the living. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has been 
known to visit tourists hurt in this town, visited Mrs. Soriano twice, 
offering to help any way he could. Soriano used to say he wanted only 
friends, not enemies. He got his wish. ``We all go to the same place 
to rest,'' Mrs. Soriano said. ``There, you see no difference in class. 
There, we are all poor. The only difference is when the rich man dies, 
people fight over the inheritance. A poor person goes to his rest 
with everyone's help. Friends, family and even those who never knew 
him.'' The letters and checks keep arriving for the Sorianos at St. 
Cecilia's Church. They come from doctors, secretaries and teachers. 
The residents of a homeless shelter collected $200 in nickels and 
dimes. The notes are signed by Anonymous, or by A New Yorker Who Cares. 
Some say nothing. Others speak volumes. ``I'm white, 55 years old, 
college-educated and have a high-paying job with a major corporation, 
live in the Wall Street area,'' wrote one person who sent $50. ``Not 
likely we would have ever met. Even if we did, we wouldn't have had 
much to talk about. ``It's funny then that reading about him today 
I found myself liking him. He was ambitious and moved to New York 
City to help himself and his family, loved the city, liked to walk 
around in it, worked hard and long hours, didn't ask the government 
for help, took care of his family, liked baseball. We would have had 
much to talk about after all.'' Nelly Diaz, the church secretary, 
has been working nonstop since last week opening letters and counting 
checks. On Wednesday alone, $1,200 came in. ``It's a big city,'' she 
said. ``But we're all one community. Their hearts go out.'' Jose Soriano 
was buried in Mexico on Wednesday. His widow stayed in New York, unwilling 
to leave until whoever killed him is found and convicted. Only then 
would she leave the city that broke her heart but ultimately healed 
her spirit. ``I do not know how I got the strength to withstand this 
pain,'' she said. ``I did it only because of the strength of my family, 
friends and people I never met. My daughter, Grizelle, is little. 
She has given me the most strength to stay on my feet and keep on 
going. That force comes from a place I never even knew I could get 
strength from.'' Grizelle, almost 3, wakes up at night asking for 
her father, wondering when he will come home with juice and candy, 
as he always did. ``She waits for him,'' Mrs. Soriano said. ``I tell 
her he's sleeping in a little box in God's house. She wants to go 
to Mexico because Papi is in Mexico.'' Sometimes the girl asks if 
Papi doesn't love them anymore. ``Oh, no,'' Mrs. Soriano says. ``He 
wanted the best for us. He just went ahead. She says, `OK Mami, OK' 
I tell her we care for him a lot.'' As do many of you, too. Though 
her husband is gone, he drew many people to his family's side. Mrs. 
Soriano embraces all of them with an abrazo that revives hope and 
gives life even to the cold ground where Jose drew his last breath.
