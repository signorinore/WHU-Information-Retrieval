If good pitching beats good hitting and anything can happen in a short 
series, how is someone to know which bromide to follow in a three-of-five-game 
division series? No problem, Johnny Oates said. Good pitching is the 
``anything'' that can happen in a short series. ``In a short series,'' 
the Texas manager said before his team played do-or-die with the Yankees 
Friday night, ``good pitching will win out. We might get fortunate 
one night and outslug the Yankees, but to think we're going to outslug 
the Yankees the next three nights to win, that's not going to happen.'' 
On the basis of the early returns, the results of the first two games, 
Oates added, he expected the series to continue along the same low-scoring 
lines. ``It's not going to be a slugfest,'' he said. Yes, he conceded, 
there might be one game where ``somebody may not have it and you're 
able to score six or seven runs, but it's not going to be that way 
every night; there are too many good pitchers.'' Oates was talking 
about pitching because he was asked an obvious question: If someone 
had told him his pitchers in the first two games of the series at 
Yankee Stadium would hold the Yankees to a total of five runs, would 
he have expected to have held a two-games-to-none lead? ``You would,'' 
he said. Holding the Yankees to five runs was indeed a credit to his 
starters, Todd Stottlemyre and Rick Helling. But the Yankees' starters, 
David Wells and Andy Pettitte, permitted only one run. ``That's the 
way playoff baseball is supposed to be,'' Oates said. ``You have the 
two best offensive clubs in the American League. On the flip side, 
you have the best pitching staff in the American League.'' The Yankees 
were No. 1 among American League pitching staffs. Boston had the second-best 
staff, Cleveland was fifth and the Rangers were all the way down the 
list as No. 12, their earned run average registering as close to 5.00 
as possible without being 5.00. Of the National League playoff teams, 
Atlanta, Houston and San Diego were 1-2-3 in pitching, with the Chicago 
Cubs a distant 11th. ``Over a 162-game schedule, the best pitching 
staffs should be in the playoffs,'' said Oates, a former major league 
catcher. ``There's a reason most of these teams are in the playoffs. 
Over the course of a season, pitching will win a lot of ball games.'' 
Pitching has won some playoff games besides the two games in New York. 
Kevin Brown outpitched Randy Johnson in San Diego's 2-1 victory over 
Houston in the first game of that NL series. Tom Glavine and Kevin 
Tapani traded shutout innings until the Cubs scored a run in the sixth, 
but then Tapani lost his shutout in the ninth and the Cubs lost to 
the Braves in the 10th in Game 2 of the other NL series. Only the 
Cleveland-Boston series has featured runs. ``When you get to this 
time of year,'' Oates said, ``I believe the high-scoring game is unusual.'' 
Another manager had a different take on the low-scoring games. He 
has watched some of the games on television, and he has noticed another 
development that could be a factor in the scoring, or lack thereof. 
``You saw a game last night,'' the manager said, speaking on the condition 
of anonymity for obvious reasons and referring to the Tapani-Glavine 
game, ``where the strike zone was out there six or eight inches and 
there were no runs. They virtually take the bats out of the hitters' 
hands.'' The manager referred, of course, to the home-plate umpire, 
who in that game was Bill Hohn. But he also said, ``The Yankee game 
was the same,'' meaning Game 2, when the plate umpire was Durwood 
Merrill. ``Durwood had strikes four to six inches outside,'' the manager 
said. ``When you see all those guys looking at the umpire, you know 
there's something going on.'' The manager was articulating a concern 
that many managers and players have raised this year. The strike zone 
may have shrunk from the top, but in the eyes of some umpires, it 
has become fatter, adding space beyond the outside corner. Glavine 
and Greg Maddux have particularly taken advantage of the growth. To 
hear some hitters and managers talk, Glavine and Maddux live out there. 
The Braves, of course, have the starting rotation against which all 
others are measured. ``Atlanta goes to the ball park every night knowing 
they're going to win,'' Oates said. ``They know they're going to pitch 
well enough so that if they scratch out three runs they're going to 
win. Can you imagine every series you go into, you know you're going 
to possibly face a 20-game winner every game?'' The Yankees had a 
20-game winner this season, and he pitched Friday night. David Cone's 
presence on the mound had to be unsettling to the Rangers because 
they had to beat him to keep playing. They might also have been unsettled 
by the presence of John Hirschbeck behind the plate. ``Oh boy,'' the 
manager said, alluding to Hirschbeck and his reputedly large strike 
zone.
