The Chicago Cubs will be home Saturday night, but they will also be 
in deep trouble. Facing elimination, and coming off a heartbreaking 
2-1 loss in 10 innings to the Atlanta Braves on Thursday night, the 
Cubs face their most imposing challenge in a season that has been 
filled with obstacles. Down by 2-0 in the three-of-five-game series, 
either the Cubs will win three consecutive games against the Braves, 
or they will be on vacation. Certainly, the Cubs will get an emotional 
lift from their fans at Wrigley Field and from the return of Kerry 
Wood (13-6), their rookie phenom who will start Game 3 against Greg 
Maddux (18-9). Yet, nobody knows what to expect from Wood, who is 
just 21, in his first post-season game. Wood, sidelined by a sore 
right elbow, has not pitched since Aug. 31. Will Wood be the overpowering 
pitcher who had 233 strikeouts this year, including a 20-strikeout 
performance against Houston? Or will Wood have problems with his control, 
his mechanics or the magnitude of the situation? Those questions will 
be answered Saturday night. The Cubs will be trying to shake off their 
deflating loss in Game 2 at Turner Field, a game that they led with 
one out in the ninth inning. Then Javy Lopez of Atlanta hit a dramatic 
home run to tie the score, and Chipper Jones had a run-scoring single 
to win it in the 10th. The loss wasted an outstanding pitching performance 
by Kevin Tapani, who was two outs away from a complete-game shutout 
until Lopez became a hero. Some teams do not recover quickly from 
losses like that. The Cubs believe they can, particularly with Wood 
on the mound. ``Kerry has lifted the spirit of the fans and his teammates 
since the day he joined us,'' said Jim Riggleman, Chicago's manager. 
``We're asking a lot of Kerry to go out there and pitch against Greg 
Maddux, but with the excitement at Wrigley Field, I think our players 
will feed off that. I think it's going to be a great day at Wrigley.'' 
Asked if he worried about Wood reinjuring his arm, Riggleman said: 
``There is always a risk of a pitcher going out there and getting 
hurt. Is there a risk of injury? Yes. But can he do it and be successful? 
Yes.'' Yet, even if Wood pitches well, Chicago must solve Atlanta's 
pitching, which is always a difficult task. The Cubs are hitting only 
.150 in the series and have scored two runs. That's a tough way to 
win games. Sammy Sosa, who hit 66 home runs during the regular season, 
has been kept in the park by the Braves. He has a single and a double 
in seven at-bats. The Braves have pitched very carefully to Sosa and 
dared other Cubs to beat them. That strategy has worked to perfection, 
and the pressure is on Chicago's other hitters to pick up the slack. 
Mark Grace is 0 for 8, Gary Gaetti is 0-for-7 and Lance Johnson is 
1-for-8. And Maddux, a four-time Cy Young award winner, is hardly 
the best pitcher to end a slump against. ``Sounds like fun, huh?'' 
Grace said when asked about the prospect of facing Maddux, after facing 
John Smoltz in Game 1 and Tom Glavine in Game 2. Asked if Atlanta's 
pitching had frustrated him, Grace said: ``I'm not frustrated. I feel 
like I'm getting good swings. But the results haven't been there.'' 
So for the Cubs, the margin for error is gone. ``We're still confident,'' 
Grace said. ``We've bounced back before, so we have to do it again.''
