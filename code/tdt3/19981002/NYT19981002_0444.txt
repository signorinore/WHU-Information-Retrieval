The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 3: The Clinton 
administration's decision to make methadone more accessible to heroin 
users is a long-needed change in national policy. Gen. Barry McCaffrey, 
head of the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, 
has proposed allowing physicians to administer methadone in their 
offices. Currently it is dispensed only in special clinics, limiting 
the number of people who can use this treatment. Only about 115,000 
of the estimated 800,000 Americans addicted to opiates are participating 
in methadone maintenance programs. Decades of experience have shown 
that methadone treatment is the most effective way to control heroin 
addiction. Methadone blunts the craving for the opiate, with substantial 
benefits to society. A federal study has found that those on methadone 
maintenance cut their heroin use by 70 percent and their criminal 
activity by 57 percent, and increased their full-time employment by 
24 percent. Scientific panels convened by the National Institutes 
of Health and the National Academy of Sciences have all recommended 
that government regulations be eased so that more people can benefit 
from methadone. Yet ignorance and prejudice persist. Several states 
ban methadone programs despite clear evidence of the treatment's effectiveness. 
The tirades against methadone by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York 
suggest that even senior officials need further enlightenment. Giuliani 
seems to believe that only abstinence can control addiction, and his 
administration continues to press forward with plans to end methadone 
maintenance programs at city hospitals that currently serve 2,100 
addicts. But medical experts, who applaud McCaffrey's recommendation, 
point out that many opiate-dependent individuals cannot remain free 
from heroin without medication. No single approach works for every 
addict, but methadone, when properly administered and coupled with 
counseling, has helped thousands reclaim their lives. Under the new 
national policy, many more addicts might do the same.
