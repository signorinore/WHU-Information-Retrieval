The weather has been unseasonably hot in central Iowa, and farmers 
who are used to worrying about getting crops out of the fields before 
the weather turns wintry are harvesting with the air-conditioning 
turned up full in the cabs of their combines. The Midwest is never 
more beautiful than at this season, even though the air is dull with 
humidity. The ditches have ripened into a pale ocherous palette of 
colors, shades of russet intermixed, and in the fields where soybeans 
have already been harvested, the stubble lies slicked back like an 
old man's crewcut. The corn hasn't stood in shocks for 60 years and 
more, but even as it stands _ dry, skeletal ruins of the plant it 
was in mid-August _ it suggests cool weather, sharp nights and the 
plumage of that most autumnal bird, the pheasant. All this would be 
enough to bring Keats to mind, except that there is nothing mild about 
the fruitfulness of the Midwest at this time of year. Because of the 
dry, warm weather, harvest is running ahead of schedule, and the fields 
are full of machinery. All-devouring combines run down the rows cutting 
20-foot swaths well into the night, moving across the landscape in 
the darkness, their lights suggesting earthgoing yachts or mobile 
oil refineries. Grain wagons pull alongside, offloading beans or corn 
from the combines' hoppers. In the stubble-rows, trucks with red boxes 
wait to be loaded, and then one after another they make their way 
to grain elevators and storage bins, where grain dryers work ceaselessly. 
The local news programs report uneven crop maturity, and when they 
are asked farmers say they hope for a freeze. It is a laborious landscape, 
and that is part of its beauty. But even as farmers stare ahead at 
the rows of uncut corn in the headlights, their minds are on the grain 
glut, which has dropped prices below the cost of production, and on 
the decline in the value of farmland. The fields are enormous, the 
yields are remarkable, the machinery is gargantuan, and so is the 
level of agricultural debt. The margin on which the enterprise operates 
this year is nearly nonexistent, which is why, as farmers watch the 
harvest progress, their minds are also on Washington, where Democrats 
and Republicans debate the terms of relief.
