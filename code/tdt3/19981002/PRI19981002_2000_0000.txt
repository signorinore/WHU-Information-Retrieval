This is THE WORLD, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI, 
and WGBH Boston. It's Friday, October 2nd. I'm Lisa Mullins in Boston. 
Today, NATO moves closer to air strikes against Serbia, but we'll 
hear skepticism about the military auction from a retired military 
man. We'll also hear skepticism about the claims of a breakthrough 
in the Middle East peace process. And we'll meet fashion designers 
who are feeling the heat for putting disabled models on the catwalk. 
Twenty or thirty years ago, designers were then criticized in absolutely 
similar ways for putting black women on the runway. And now, of course, 
that seems ridiculous. First, this news. From National Public Radio 
News in Washington, I'm Corey Flintoff.
