Congress has made public the final batch of documents from independent 
counsel Kenneth Starr's impeachment referral. NPR's Mara Liasson reports. 
Included in the almost 5,000 pages of material is the grand jury testimony 
of several key White House officials, Vernon Jordan, the president's 
friend, and transcripts of tape recordings between Monica Lewinsky 
and her former friend, Linda Tripp. White House lawyer Greg Craig 
says the release today shows that Starr's impeachment referral left 
out a lot of information favorable to the president. For example, 
Craig says... The referral also neglects to include the fact that 
Ms. Lewinsky told the president she wanted to move to New York in 
July 1997, five months before she was ever mentioned in the Jones 
case. Craig says the material undercuts Starr's argument that the 
president obstructed justice by promising Lewinsky a job in return 
for her silence. Mara Liasson, NPR News, the White House.
