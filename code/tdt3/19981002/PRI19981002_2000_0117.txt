The nation's unemployment rate edged slightly higher in September 
as job creation slowed. The Labor Department said the jobless rate 
rose to 4.6 percent. A federal separate report showed that non-farm 
payrolls grew by only 69,000 last month. That's the slowest rate of 
growth in almost three years, and it's down sharply from August when 
new jobs increased by 309,000. Katherine Abraham, the commissioner 
of Labor Statistics, said the weak job growth reflects an unusually 
small increase in service jobs and job losses in manufacturing in 
construction.
