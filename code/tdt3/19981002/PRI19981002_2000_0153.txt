President Boris Yeltsin is trying to reassure Russians he'll protect 
their economic freedoms and will not permit any restrictions on the 
flow of foreign currencies. NPR's Michelle Kelleman reports. With 
no clear economic plan announced, Russia's rumor mill has moved into 
high gear and citizens are worried the new government may start to 
infringe on their rights to hold foreign currency, including dollars. 
But Yeltsin's new spokesman, Dimitri Yakushkin, says the Kremlin leader 
will hold firm. He says Yeltsin would view any effort to prohibit 
Russians from buying hard currency as a return to the iron curtain. 
Yeltsin's been out of public view during much of the debate on how 
to bring Russia out of crisis and has long kept his distance from 
the day-to-day running of affairs, but he still has broad constitutional 
powers and could step in if the government limits currency trade or 
nationalizes some banks as reports have suggested. Prime Minister 
Yevgeny Primakov meanwhile says his government is just starting to 
work out the economic plan. Michelle Kelleman, NPR News, Moscow.
