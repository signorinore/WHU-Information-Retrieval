Singing cowboy actor Gene Autry died today at his home in Studio City, 
California. He was 91. Autry appeared in almost 100 movies, starred 
in his own television show in the 1950s, and had such hit records 
as "Back in the Saddle Again," and "Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer." 
He parlayed his entertainment earnings into a business empire that 
included radio and television stations, a hotel, and the Anaheim Angels 
baseball team.
