A judge at Camp Le Jeune, North Carolina has agreed to delay the trials 
of two marines charged with the deaths of 20 ski gondola passengers 
in the Italian alps last year. Eileen LeBlanc reports from member 
station WHQR in Wilmington. The pilot and the navigator of a jet which 
sliced through the gondola cable causing its crash down the mountainside 
will have their trials in February. Attorneys for the prosecution 
and the defense wanted the trials moved back from the December and 
January dates to allow for more time to question witnesses in Italy. 
Captain Richard Ashby, the pilot of the plane, will go to court on 
February the 4th. Captain Joseph Schweitzer on the 22nd. The trials 
are expected to last two weeks each. The marine prosecutor had also 
asked the judge to have the trials overlap so that it might be more 
convenient for witnesses and the families of victims traveling from 
Europe. The judge denied that request because of space available and 
so that the trials might proceed in an orderly fashion. For NPR News, 
I'm Eileen LeBlanc in Wilmington, North Carolina.
