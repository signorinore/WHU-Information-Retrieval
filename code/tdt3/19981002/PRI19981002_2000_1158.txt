Still to come, today's Wall Street update and their body language 
says it all. Netanyahu, Arafat, and the Middle East process on PRI, 
Public Radio International. Good evening from 91 FM, WHYY. Here's 
the forecast from the Franklin Institute. Tonight, mostly clear and 
cool, low 46, and in the upper 30s in some northern and western suburbs. 
Saturday, sunshine, then increasing afternoon clouds, high 68. Sunday, 
clouds and some sun, a few showers are possible. High again, 68. Coming 
up on the program, THE WORLD, we'll hear about fashion designers and 
companies which use their popularity to promote political and social 
causes. Also, the daily geography quiz. You're tuned to the world 
on 91 fm, whyy. This is THE WORLD. I'm Lisa Mullins.
