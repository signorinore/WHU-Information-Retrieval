Defense Secretary William Cohen has warned NATO will act against Serbian 
forces in Kosovo in less than two weeks if President Slobodan Milosevic 
of Yugoslavia does not comply with all the demands of the international 
community. Earlier, President Clinton said the Yugoslav leader should 
act now to stop the violence against the people of Kosovo. We have 
been working for months and months. I have personally been working 
for months first of all to get NATO and then to get the U.N. to send 
a message to Mr. Milosevic to stop the violence. We have NATO working. 
We have the U.N. resolution. I believe that our allies in Europe are 
with us. And I think that we understand and we hope he got the message.
