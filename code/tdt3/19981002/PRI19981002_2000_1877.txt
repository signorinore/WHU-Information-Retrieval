A U.N. court has sentenced a former mayor in Rwanda to life imprisonment 
for crimes against humanity. Jean-Paul Akayesu was found guilty of 
the genocide in his town of Taba in 1994. The BCC's Martin Dawes the 
story. The former mayor of Taba has been given a life term after a 
trial that started in January 1997. The international judges rejected 
his submissions that he was a minor official who was powerless to 
prevent the killings. They've taken the view that those who do not 
what they can to prevent such illegal activities are guilty. Some 
2,000 Tutsis are thought to be murdered in Taba. For the first time 
in international law, they said that sexual violence against women 
from a particularly ethnic group is a crime of genocide. Martin Dawes, 
BBC, Nairobi.
