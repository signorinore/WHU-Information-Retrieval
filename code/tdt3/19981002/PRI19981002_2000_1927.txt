It looks like the end of the road for a transportation institution 
in India's capital Delhi. For decades, the streets have echoed to 
the sound of old three-wheel taxis known as fut-futs, but they'll 
soon disappear under anti-pollution legislation banning vehicles over 
20 years old. Daniel Lack reports from Delhi. It's been a familiar 
sight on Delhi's streets for more than 20 years. The fut-fut, as it's 
known here, has a Harley-Davidson engine and a three-wheeler Indian 
designed chassis. It's supposed to carry eight people but many more 
often crowd aboard for the trip from the center of New Delhi to the 
congested heart of the old mogul city. The fut-fut has fallen victim 
to a Delhi government desperate to bring air pollution under control. 
Pollution activists say it's a welcome step. Fut-fut owners and drivers 
of other forms of old public transport say the government is snatching 
away their livelihood. Daniel Lack, BBC, Delhi.
