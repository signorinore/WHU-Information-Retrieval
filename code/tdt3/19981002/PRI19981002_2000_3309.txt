For today's musical finale, we head to Australia where shortly voters 
will cast their ballots in national elections. Prime minister John 
Howard is locked in a close race with a labor opposition. Third party 
candidate Pauline Hanson is hoping to play the role of spoiler and 
send the elections into a runoff. And Australians will have a chance 
to vote for a politician who's on the pop charts. I don't like it 
when you turn my voice about. I don't like it when you bite one. I 
don't like it. "I Don't Like It" samples the speeches of Pauline Hanson. 
It's just a gag, but Hanson is not amused. She don't likes "I Don't 
Like It" or its producer. My name is Pauline Pantsdown. I am independent 
candidate for the new Sofwell for the federal election. I think I'm 
a multi-faceted character. And that he is. Pantsdown, whose real name 
is Simon Hunt is a former University Arts lecturer in Sydney and current 
gay drag queen candidate for public office. One of his most visible 
and popular campaign tactics was the production of "I Don't Like It." 
All it did was it got Mrs. Hanson's voice, collected her speeches 
from radio and television, fed it all into this system with a little 
bouncy wave forms going up and down the screen, and then just get 
various sort of syllables and words and just sort of, you know, make 
it more sensible. Whether "I Don't Like It" will help or hinder Pantsdown's 
candidacy is hard to say, but the song has won over Sydney's dance 
club devotees. As for his election platform, Pauline Pantsdown says 
it has two main planks: politics and fashion. On one hand, I want 
to save Australia from the racists. On the other hand, I want to keep 
up the appalling dress sets and makeup standards that Mrs. Hanson 
has set in parliament. Pauline Pantsdown says he shares the same fashion 
sense as Pauline Hanson and he believes the same political future. 
I'm completely intimately tied to her career. In fact, both of us 
might be about to finish our careers this coming weekend when the 
federal election takes place.
