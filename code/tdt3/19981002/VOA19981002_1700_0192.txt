President Clinton says he hopes a resolution can be found to the growing 
conflict in Kosovo, but says the international community must remain 
firm with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. VOA's Deborah Tate 
reports. With NATO ready to use air strikes to enforce last week's 
U.N. Security Council resolution for the pull back of Yugoslav security 
forces in Kosovo, Mr. Clinton says the United States and his allies 
must not waiver in demanding that Mr. Milosevic and his crackdown 
on Ethnic Albanians. We had be very, very strong here. We need to 
stop the violence, get a negotiated settlement and work our way through 
this. Speaking to reporters before leaving on a fundraising trip to 
Ohio and Pennsylvania, Mr. Clinton said he hoped there would be a 
positive resolution to the crisis to prevent a humanitarian disaster 
involving thousands of Kosovo refugees this winter. Deborah Tate, 
VOA News at the White House.
