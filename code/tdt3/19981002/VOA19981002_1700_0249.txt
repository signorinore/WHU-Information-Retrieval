YACKIE Israel has imposed closure on the Palestinian territories for 
at least the next four days, amid reports of fresh evidence of efforts 
by Palestinian militants to launch terrorist attacks. VOA's Al Pessin 
reports from Jerusalem. The closure was imposed after what Israel 
radio calls the most serious warnings ever that the militant Palestinian 
group Hamas is planning an attack. Defense Minister Yitzak Mordecai 
who decided on the closure is quoted as saying Hamas is planning an 
unprecedented and horrific attack. No details were provided. There 
have been several incidents in recent days which indicate Hamas is 
trying hard to make good on threats to launch new attacks on Israelis, 
and government spokesman Michel Fogel says Israel is taking them seriously. 
They said it several times, but they haven't succeeded in doing so, 
but it's clear that they're intent upon carrying out a large terrorist 
attack now. The Palestinian authorities says it is doing all it can 
to prevent terror attacks and brands closures ineffective and unfair.
