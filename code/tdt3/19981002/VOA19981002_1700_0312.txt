Iraq is calling for an investigation of the United Nations Weapons 
Commission in response to revelations that Israel has been providing 
intelligence to the U.N. body. Reports in Israel and American newspapers 
have quoted former Arms Inspector Scott Ritter as saying he dealt 
with Israeli intelligence in seeking information on Iraq's weapons 
program. Chief U.N. Weapons Inspector Richard Butler says Israel is 
among 50 countries cooperating with the U.N. inspectors.
