Angolan State Radio says eight people have been killed and 16 wounded 
by an anti-tank mine in EasternAngola. The incident occurred when 
a vehicle drove over a mine north of the town of Luena. It was not 
clear whether the victims were civilian or military. Angola, which 
has been racked by decades of civil war, is considered one of the 
world's most heavily mined countries. I'm Carol Castielle, VOA News.
