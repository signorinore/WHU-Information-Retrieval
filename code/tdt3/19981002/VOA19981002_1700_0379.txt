The U.N. Security Council issued a new call Friday for the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia to cooperate with an international criminal 
tribunal investigating violations of out humanitarian law and in the 
former Yugoslavia. VOA Correspondent Max Rustin reports from the United 
Nations. The Council issued its statement after receiving a briefing 
from the President of the International Criminal Tribunal for the 
Former Yugoslavia Gabrielle Kirk McDonald. The Council's statement 
expresses support for the tribunal and deplores the lack of cooperation 
it has received from the Yugoslav government headed by President Slobodan 
Milosevic. Ms. McDonald reported to the Council on Yugoslovia's continuing 
refusal to arrest and extradite three men indicted in the 1991 killings 
of 260 unarmed people in the eastern Croatian city of Vuguvar after 
it fell to Serbian forces. The Yugoslav government has refused the 
extradition request, saying it is barred by its constitution from 
transferring the men out of the country. Ms. McDonald rejected that 
claim, saying international law, Security Council resolutions and 
the Date and Peace Agreement require compliance with the Tribunal's 
orders. She called on the Security Council to approve a resolution 
reminding the Yugoslav government of its obligations. gabrielle kirk 
mcdonald, president, international criminal It seems to me that the 
deploring and condemning language is helpful, but stronger actions 
need to be taken. I wouldn't specify what particular actions, but 
it seems to me that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia should be told 
that the time is now. In fact, it's long overdue in terms of responding 
-- in terms of responding to its obligations. Yugoslavia's troubles 
with the Tribunal come amid growing international condemnation of 
Mr. Milosevic for his crackdown on Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province. 
The United States and Britain have warned of possible NATO military 
strikes against Yugoslav's security forces in the province, if Mr. 
Milosevic does not comply with Security Council resolutions demanding 
an immediate cease fire and peace talks. Max Rustin, VOA News, United 
Nations.
