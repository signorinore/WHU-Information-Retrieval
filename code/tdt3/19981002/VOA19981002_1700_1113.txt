Time now for sports and here's Dave Byrd. Dave. :05) DAVE BYRD, VOA 
CORRESPONDENT: All right. Thanks a lot, Susan. It has been a pitcher's 
dual, so far, at Boston's Fenway Park where the Boston Red Sox are 
playing Cleveland in game three of the American League divisional 
series. Both Boston's Brett Saberhagen and Cleveland's Charles Negy 
are playoff veterans. And so far, they've been getting the better 
of the sticks on both sides where the score is currently Boston one 
and Cleveland nothing. The second game of the day has the Texas Rangers 
fighting for survival as they host the New York Yankees. And the Yankees 
lead two game to none, so a Rangers loss would end their World Series 
hopes. The pinstripers have 20-game winner David Cohen pitching against 
Erin Sealy a 19-game winner for Texas this season.
