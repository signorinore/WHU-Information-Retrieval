In the National League, the Atlanta Braves came from behind to take 
a two-to-nothing series lead over the Chicago Cubs with a two-to-one 
victory Thursday night in Atlanta. And the Braves tied the game in 
the ninth inning with a solo home run by Harvey Lopez and Chipper 
Jones drove in the red -- winning run in the 10th inning. Jones says 
the win was big before the series moves to Chicago. The Bull Pins 
did a great job. We did what it took to get guys on in the last inning 
and finally I put the bat on the ball and one fell in. It was just 
-- I tell you, I can't explain how I'm feeling right now. Sy Young, 
an award Tom Glavin lasted seven innings on the mound for the Babes. 
And despite the loss, the Cubs had a great pitching performance. From 
19-game winner Kevin Taphony, Braves Manager Bobby Cox says anything 
can happen in the post season. The playoffs are different. Anybody 
can be a hero in the playoffs and, you know, Ryan against Cleveland 
hit a couple of homeruns and Andrew against the Yankees, as in a 19-year-old 
kid, hit two homeruns in the same game. So, you know, it -- it moves 
around from player to player.
