Well, in the fashion scene, we get word that and American fashion 
designer considered most likely to succeed is not a success, after 
all. Isaac Mizrahi, one of the New York fashion community's most celebrated 
figures has announced he'll close his business this week. Chanel, 
Incorporated, the American arm of the French fashion house, financially 
supported Mr. Mizrahi's business since 1992, but has decided to end 
the support after years of losses. The New York Times reports that, 
despite his creativity and irrepressible personality, he failed to 
create a signature image which average shoppers could identify with. 
He told the Times he'll focus on his emerging career as an actor, 
screenwriter and film producer, unless a suitable backer comes along 
to support him as a designer. Well, there's an opening for us, Susan. 
We can get into fashion designing.
