You can, Tom. I'll stay right here at VOA News Now. It's time to talk 
about frequencies. If you're listening to us in or the Pacific, you 
can consider switching over right now to 9.705 megahertz short wave, 
which we're now broadcasting on from 21 hours to zero hour Universal 
Time. You know, we'd be happy to mail you a VOA Frequency schedule, 
so you could tune us in any time. Just send us your name and address, 
printed or typed, on a letter or postcard. Mail it to VOA News Now, 
Voice of America, Washington, D.C., 20547, USA. Or you can e-mail 
us that information, your name and address. Our e-mail address is 
newsnow@voa.gov. And in this case, News Now is one word. It's 21 hours, 
30 Universal Time and this is VOA News Now. President Clinton proposes 
an initiative to provide emergency funding for countries affected
