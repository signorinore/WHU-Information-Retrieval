I'm Dave DeForest, VOA News. President Clinton has expressed frustration 
with Congress for not acting on his proposed initiative to provide 
emergency funding for countries affected by global financial turmoil. 
VOA's Deborah Tate reports. Mr. Clinton expressed his frustration 
with lawmakers for not acting on his request for an additional $18 
billion to replenish IMF resources that have been depleted by bailouts 
of economies in Southeast Asia and Russia. He spoke at a Democratic 
Party fund-raiser in Cleveland, Ohio. _ I have been waiting eight 
months for the Congress to fund what we owe to the IMF. The United 
States has got to lead the world out of this financial mess and we've 
got to do it before it bites us and our friends in Europe and even 
sooner our friends in Latin America. Earlier at the White House, Mr. 
Clinton called congressional inaction on the measure inexcusable. 
The Senate has passed Mr. Clinton's funding request, but the House 
of Representatives want the IMF to implement reforms before approving 
the package. Deborah Tate, VOA News at the White House.
