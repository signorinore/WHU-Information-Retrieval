And on this week's edition of U.S. Environmental, Anne Skyrble reports 
on forest fire research, our controversy surrounding the hunted gray 
whales and a day of celebration for America's estuaries. Ten years 
ago, forest fires raged out of control when Yellowstone National Park, 
the nation's oldest and largest park outside of Alaska. The decision 
to let the forest burn was controversial. But according to park officials 
was nature's way of cleaning house. That decision was supported by 
Donald Turcott, a Geophysicist at Cornell University. Mr. Turcott 
has since developed a computer model that charged the frequency of 
small and medium fires. In a recent issue of the Journal Science, 
Mr. Turcott maintains that allowing enough small fires to burn to 
a sufficient size, reduces the hazard of bigger disasters. Our indications 
are that the distribution of clusters of trees or burnable areas follows 
set statistical patterns which are similar -- patterns that we get 
and you can sort of decide where you need to attack these to prevent 
these from going into larger combustible recions. While research managers 
acknowledge that controlled burning or even igniting fires benefits 
the forest. Donald Turcott says his computer model suggests the technique 
is not used nearly enough.
