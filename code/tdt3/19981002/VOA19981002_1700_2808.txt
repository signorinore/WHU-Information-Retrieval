In the next few days, a small band of native Americans living in the 
West Coast state of Washington, will embark on an expedition to hunt 
a gray whale. This age-old tradition among the Macaw Indian Nation, 
was voluntarily broken 70 yeas ago, when Caucasian hunters had all 
but hunted the Gray whale to extinction. The International Whaling 
Commission recently granted the McCaw, the right to kill five gray 
whales a year for trabal use. A treaty with the U.S. government also 
guarantees that right. Expedition hunter Eric Johnson says the McCaw 
nation is poor. Unemployment on the reservation is 50 percent. But 
Mr. Johson says whaling is also an integral part of the tribal culture. 
To be proud again, a lot of people think that we need to . This embrace 
of cultural heritage is not without controversy. Anti-whaling groups 
have vowed to stop the expedition and fear that a successful hunt 
will encourage other native tribes to return to their whaling tradition 
which, they say, will increase pressure on the already fragile whale 
population.
