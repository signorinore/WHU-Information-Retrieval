The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 7784, up 152 points or 
2 percent. For the week, the industrial average lost 244 points or 
3 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index closed Friday at 1,002, 
up 16 points. Analysts say the rally was a combination of bargain 
hunting and some optimism about the international situation. Bargain 
hunting was to be expected after the 6 percent loss earlier in the 
week. Traders were also encouraged by President Clinton's call for 
new initiatives to relieve international financial problems. There 
was also hope that the weekend meeting of finance ministers and central 
bankers from major industrialized nations will prove helpful. Breck 
Artery, VOA News, New York.
