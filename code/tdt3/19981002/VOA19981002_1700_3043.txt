Japan's powerful lower House of Parliament has passed a set of key 
financial bills. But as Amy Bickers reports from the VOA Asian News 
Center, some important measures remain unresolved. The country has 
many troubled banks. They lent too much money in the 1980s and now 
carry about $1 trillion in bad debts. The bills are the result of 
several weeks of wrangling between Japan's ruling party and opposition 
lawmakers. The legislation includes several options to deal with failed 
banks and also provides for the establishment of the new independent 
committee to share certain powers with the finance ministry. But lawmakers 
have yet to agree on several points, including how to handle weak 
banks which are on the way to failing. Tom Smithers, an economist 
with ING Barings in Tokyo says many investors are watching to see 
if and when the loose ends will be tied. To be honest, there's still 
some skepticism that the deal will be achievable. And I think the 
attitude in a lot of the financial markets these days towards the 
Japanese government is, well, now, we'll believe it when we see it. 
There was another sign Friday that Japan's economy will remain stuck 
in a deep recession. Officials said the country's jobless rate climbed 
back to a record high in August. It stands at 4.3 percent, a rate 
it first touched in June. It improved slightly in July before slipping 
back again. The head of the country's economic planning agency says 
the nation's unemployment figures are severe and unlikely to improve 
soon. Mr. Smithers says the data could have been even worse. Over 
the next few months, we probably expect to see unemployment arise 
in Japan, as Japanese corporations restructure. But the doomsday scenario 
which people are painting certainly wasn't evident in these figures. 
Still, Mr. Smithers and other analysts agree a number of factors suggest 
Japan's economy will remain in recession at least through the end 
of the year. Amy Bickers for VOA News, Hong Kong.
