Yugoslav authorities faced with growing threats of NATO action to 
end violence in Serbia's Kosovo Province have invited U.N. Secretary 
General Kofi Anan to visit the area. In Washington, President Clinton 
says the international community must strongly pursue its demands 
for and end to Serbian violence against the Albanians. U.S. Defense 
Secretary William Cohen warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
that pulling back some of its forces is not sufficient to avoid a 
NATO military response. Some of the forces have withdrawn, not all 
of them. But there seems to be some movement back. But it has not 
been complete and, again, this is not a question of Milosevic simply 
pulling some forces back and saying, there, I've complied with the 
Security Council demands. Mr. Cohen repeated international demands 
for a withdrawal of armed forces' free access for humanitarian aid 
deliveries and the start of talks with Kosovo's Ethnic Albanian majority.
