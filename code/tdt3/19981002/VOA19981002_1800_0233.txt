Turkey's Cypriot leader, Ralph Dinktash has called on the international 
community to recognize the political legitimacy of the break away 
Turkish community on Cypress. Mr. Dinktash told a news conference 
at the United Nations Friday, following a meeting with Secretary General 
Kofi Anan. VOA Correspondent Alaine Johansen reports from New York. 
The Turkish cypriots view political equality with the majority Greek 
community on Cypress as a pre- condition for a negotiated settlement. 
Their leader, Mr. Dinktash, has made that point with increasing assertiveness 
ever since Turkish Cypriates broke away 15 years ago and set up their 
own government in Northern Cypress. Mr. Dinktash believes the rupture 
can never be repaired completely. He has offered, at best, to consider 
a loose confederation on Cypress that effectively would allow each 
side to continue a separate existence. Mr. Dinktash also insists that 
the Turkish troops -- sent to Cypress in 1974 when Greece engineered 
a coupe in Nicosea must stay, despite international pressure for their 
withdrawal. Western diplomats consider the Cypress situation a potential 
powder keg for NATO's southern flank. Alaine Johansen, VOA News, New 
York.
