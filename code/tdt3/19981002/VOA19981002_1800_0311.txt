Australians are going to the polls Saturday to elect a government 
that will steer their nation into the next century. Prime Minister 
John Howard and his liberal national coalition are locked in a bitter 
struggle with the Opposition Labor Party of Ken Beasley. Mr. Howard 
won a landslide victory in 1996 to end 13 years of labor rule. The 
latest public opinion polls show the ruling coalition with a narrow 
lead, but minor parties could affect the outcome.
