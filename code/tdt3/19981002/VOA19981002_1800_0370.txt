Albania Friday joined international calls for an end to violence in 
Yugoslavia's Kosovo Province and accused Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic of genocide. VOA Correspondent Max Rustin reports from U.N. 
headquarters in New York. In a speech to the United Nations General 
Assembly, Albanian Foreign Minister Pascal Milo urged the international 
community to hold Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic responsible 
for atrocities in Kosovo. He called on the International Criminal 
Court for the Former Yugoslavia to start an investigation for the 
indictment of Mr. Milosevic as a war criminal and said the Yugoslav 
leader should be held accountable and responsible for genocide. What 
is happening today in Kosovo, Mr. President, is the story of the -- 
following tragedy. Milosevic has, in fact, ordered implementation 
of his ethnic cleansing policy against Albanians, under the pretext 
of combating the so-called Albanian terrorists. This has, so far, 
proven to be a constant element of his strategy. The Yugoslav government 
says its security forces have been fighting Ethnic Albanian terrorists 
in Kosovo and denies responsibility for any atrocities committed there. 
It has accused the Albanian government of supporting Albanian separatists 
in the province. The Albanian government statement comes amid a firming 
up of international opinion on Kosovo. There is a growing consensus 
that Mr. Milosevic is responsible for unwarranted violence against 
civilians and that he is deliberately rejecting U.N. Security Council 
calls for a cease fire and a negotiated settlement to the conflict. 
The Council on Thursday announced the latest atrocities in Kosovo. 
Council members indicated further measures may be taken next week, 
after Secretary General Kofi Anan submits a report on the situation 
there. In the Council, U.S. and British diplomats have indicated support 
for military strikes against Yugoslav security forces in Kosovo. China 
and Russia have opposed military intervention. NATO is reported to 
have completed preparations for such strikes. Max Rustin, VOA News,
