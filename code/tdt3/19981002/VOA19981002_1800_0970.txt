And we have this sad note: Hollywood's original singing cowboy, Gene 
Autry has died in Los Angeles at the age of 91. He had been ill for 
a long time. VOA's Michael Sullivan has this look at Mr. Autry's musical 
contributions. Gene Autry was working as a railroad telegraph operator 
in Oklahoma, when the legendary story teller Will Rodgers heard him 
sing and encouraged him to enter show business. In 1928, he started 
performing on local radio. And in 1934, began his prolific movie career. 
By the late, 1930s, Gene Autry was one of Hollywood's most popular 
actors. He also wrote more than 200 songs, including the Christmastime 
favorite, "Here Comes Santa Claus." Building on his success as a performer, 
Gene Autry went on to build a business empire that included radio 
and television stations and the California Angels baseball team. Mike 
O'Sullivan, VOA News, Los Angeles.
