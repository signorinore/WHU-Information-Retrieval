It's time now for a look at sports. And joining us here in the studio 
with the latest is VOA's Dave Byrd. All right. Thanks a lot, Tony. 
The series between the Cleveland Indians and the Boston Red Sox in 
baseball's American League is currently tied at 1 game apiece. But 
so far, the score in game three is Cleveland, three and Boston, one. 
It was mostly a pitcher's dual for the first four innings. But all 
the Indians runs came on solo homers, including one over-the-green 
monster. And the Red Sox removed starter Brett Saberhagen for the 
7th inning. Charles Nagey is still on the mound for Cleveland. In 
the second game of the day has the Texas Rangers fighting for survival, 
as they host the New York Yankees. The Yankees lead two games to none. 
So if the Rangers lose tonight, that would be it for their World Series 
hopes.
