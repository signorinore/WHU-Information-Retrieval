In Georgetown, Kentucky, the Georgetown College football team includes 
a 34-year-old man. Sylvestor Turner is almost twice as old as some 
college students. He had dropped out of college and given up his collegiate 
football career. And by the way, we're talking about American-style 
football. Well, now he has resumed both. So far this season, Sylvestor 
Turner has made an interception and saved a touchdown by running down 
a receiver from 25 meters behind. Mr. Turner says, that's not bad 
for an old man.
