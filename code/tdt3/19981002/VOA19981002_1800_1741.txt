We're coming on the half hour. We've got a bit of news coming your 
way in just a few moments. We'd like to pass on this frequency announcement, 
however. At 22 hours, 30, universal time, we'll be saying good night 
to our listeners in Africa and we thank you for being with us and 
we hope you'll be sure to tune us in again tomorrow morning, beginning 
at three hours, universal time, when VOA News Now resumes on 6.08, 
6.115, 7.105, 7.28, 7.29, 7.34, 9.575, and 9.885 megahertz short wave, 
plus 90.9 kilohertz medium wave to Southern Africa and 1530 kilohertz 
medium wave to Western and Central Africa. If you're listening on 
short-wave right now, in the Eastern Mediterranean, we invite you 
to switch over to 1548 kilohertz, medium wave, as VOA News Now continues. 
It's 22 hours, 30, universal time. From Washington, this is VOA News 
Now. President Clinton proposes an initiative to provide emergency 
funding for countries affected by global economic turmoil. We'll have 
more on that coming up in just a few moments. Russia's president says 
he'll stop lawmakers from imposing new economic controls and will 
examine the pros and cons of Western military action in Kosovo. We'll 
have these and other stories, plus business news and more, in this 
half hour of VOA News Now.
