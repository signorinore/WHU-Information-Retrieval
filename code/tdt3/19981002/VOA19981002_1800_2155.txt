Yugoslav authorities have invited U.N. Security General Kofi Anan 
to visit Serbia's Kosovo Province, as NATO threatens action to end 
the violence there. The Yugoslav news agency says this will give Mr. 
Anan a firsthand view and an understanding of the situation. In Washington, 
President Clinton stressed the importance of stopping the violence. 
He says the international community does not want thousands caught 
up in war or starving or freezing in winter, after being displaced.
