Turkish-Syrian relations are tense after warned that Syria should 
end its hostile attitude toward Turkey. Turkey has threatened to use 
military force unless Damascus ends its support for the separatists 
Kurdistan Workers Party, the BKK. Ali Jilali sent us this report from 
Istanbul. The strongest-ever warning to Syria was given Wednesday, 
by Turkey's president Solamam Dimni Ralf.. Angara has accused Syria 
for many years of supporting the PKK and hosting its leader Abdula 
Irjalon. Turkey also believes the PKK militants are being trained 
in Lebanon's -- Valley, which is under Syrian control. Syria has repeatedly 
denied the charges. Despite the media reports of a military buildup 
near the Syrian boarder, many Turkish analysts do not expect an armed 
conflict between Turkey and its southern neighbor. In a telephone 
interview with VOA, Turkish columnist Dr. Shahim Albai says the build-up 
is nearly muscle flexing, at most. He said the potential consequences 
of a military confrontation are too serious to justify the use of 
force. Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sesgen is quoted in the Turkish 
press as saying if diplomacy fails to solve the problem between the 
two countries, the game, in his words, will be played according to 
rules. Professor Sali Urzel of Bowazichi University says issues dividing 
Turkey and Syria are too serious to be resolved by a single action 
or in the near future. I think the Turkish-Syrian relations, as you 
may have seen indications of, are going to get worse before they get 
any better. And if they will ever get any better, I don't know. And 
it's obvious that the Turkish-Israeli by both Israel and -- by all 
parties involved as something that squeezes Syria.
