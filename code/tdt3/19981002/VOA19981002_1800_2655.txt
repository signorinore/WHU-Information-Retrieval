Here in Washington, the House Judiciary Committee has released thousands 
of pages of evidence gathered by special prosecutor Kenneth Starr 
in his investigation of the Monica Lewinsky affair. The three-volume 
set of documents includes grand jury testimony and transcripts of 
Pentagon worker Linda Tripp's secretly taped conversations with Miss 
Lewinsky. Mr. Starr has accused President Clinton of perjury and abuse 
of office, in trying to keep his affair with Miss Lewinsky secret. 
Meanwhile, democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have introduced 
their proposal for a narrowly focused impeachment inquiry that would 
end by November 25th. And that's a look at the top stories in the 
news at this hour, here on VOA News Now.
