And right now, it is time for business news. We go to New York for 
a report on the financial markets. Here's Breck Artery with an update 
on activity on Wall Street and elsewhere around the world. The Dow 
Jones Industrial Average closed at 7784, up 152 points or two percent. 
For the week, the industrial average lost 244 points or three percent. 
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index closed Friday at 1,002, up 16 points. 
Analysts say the rally was a combination of bargain hunting and some 
optimism about the international situation. Bargain hunting was to 
be expected after the six percent loss earlier in the week. Traders 
were also encouraged by President Clinton's call for new initiatives 
to relieve international financial problems. There was also hope that 
the weekend meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from 
the major industrialized nations will prove helpful. Breck Artery, 
VOA News, New York.
