Hello, everyone and welcome to Science World. I'm Brian Sislack. The 
subject of asteroids plummeting into the earth continues to captivate 
the public imagination, with even Hollywood getting into the act. 
The most recent inducement to asteroid phobia comes from a pair of 
University of Hawaii researchers. David Tholin and Robert Whitley 
say they've discovered a new class of never- before-seen asteroids 
that can sneak up on us and pummel our planet without warning. These 
asteroids are not the usual ones that orbit the sun between Mars and 
Jupiter. The object Tholin and Whitley photographed at Hawaii's Mt. 
Acaia Observatory had an -- orbited between the earth and the sun. 
This particular asteroid never comes closer to earth than 1.2 million 
kilometers, so there's no chance that it would ever be an Armageddon 
object. But if any one of its sister asteroids were to cross the path 
of our planet, while on the sun-lit side, we would not see it in time 
to do anything about it. The asteroid in question, designated 1998 
DK-36, can only been seen just before dawn or just after sunset. It's 
about 40 meters across, roughly, the estimated size of the Tungusca 
object that plunged into Siberia in 1908, destroying almost 2,000 
square kilometers of forest. NASA, the U.S. space agency, says there 
are 128 asteroids that come close enough to earth to bare watching. 
If Tholan and Whitley are right, there may be others.
