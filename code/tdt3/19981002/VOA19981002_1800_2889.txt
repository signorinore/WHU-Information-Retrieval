Those looking for a natural and effective way to treat alcoholism 
may ultimately find one in a yellow-flowered herb called St. John's 
Wort. Herbalists have been touting it for the past several years as 
a treatment for depression because its active ingredient, herbacin, 
boosts levels of the brain chemical serotinin. Diminished serotinin 
levels are often linked with depression and, by extension, alcoholism. 
Researchers at the University of North Carolina fed an extract of 
St. John's Wort to rats with a genetic predisposition to prefer alcohol 
over water They reduced their alcohol consumption by half, as compared 
with controlled rats which had not consumed the herbal extract. But 
the researchers caution against self- medicating with St. John's Wort 
as a way of battling alcoholic cravings, at least for now. The safe 
and effective dose has not yet been determined, nor is it known whether 
the herb interacts negatively with alcohol or other drugs. The North 
Carolina team remain hopeful about St. John's Wort because most of 
the currently used drugs for treating alcoholism have side effects 
that discourage their use.
