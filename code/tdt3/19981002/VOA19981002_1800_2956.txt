nanobacteria. These are very, very tiny microorganisms that are just 
a fraction of the size of normal bacteria. The researchers found nano 
bacteria in 30 kidney stones isolated from patients. It seems the 
tiny organisms grow a calcium-rich shell. The Finnish researchers 
think that calcium salts from the body might layer themselves atop 
the nano bacterial shells, forming the stones that can be so painful. 
If this is true, antibiotics might prevent the stones from returning 
after treatment.
