Boxing veteran George Foreman has found a way to celebrate his 50th 
birthday. He's going back into the ring and he'll be fighting Larry 
Holmes, who will be 49 years old, by the time the boxing match takes 
place in January. The aging fighters announced the fight, while acknowledging 
they're not young men anymore. Foreman noted that usually the doctors 
check a boxer's heart before a match. While Foreman jokes that, with 
him and Larry Holmes, the doctors are just going to see if we have 
a pulse. George Foreman reportedly will get $10 million for the fight 
and Holmes will get $4 million. At 99, the combined age of the fighters, 
is believed to be the highest in boxing history.
