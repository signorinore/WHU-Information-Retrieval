Fans of the three "Star Wars" science fiction movies have been excited 
about the fact that more are planned. One of them is due in theaters 
some time next year and now it has a title. The new film is to be 
called "Star Wars, Episode 1: The Phantom Menace." It will be part 
of a series of three films that will precede the stories that were 
told in the "Star Wars" films of the late 1970s and 1980s. "Star Wars, 
Episode 1: The Phantom Menace" is due to open in theaters here in 
the United States on may 21, 1991.
