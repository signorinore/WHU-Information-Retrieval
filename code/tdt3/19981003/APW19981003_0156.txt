In advance of a visit next week by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright, Palestinians on Saturday urged Israel to avoid ``delaying 
tricks'' they said have so far prevented the two sides from reaching 
an accord. Meanwhile, a small-scale clash broke out Saturday in the 
divided West Bank town of Hebron, where Israeli soldiers fired rubber 
bullets at a small group of stone-throwers. It has been a tense week 
in Hebron, which is home to 450 Jewish settlers and 130,000 Palestinians 
and a frequent flashpoint for violence. On Friday, seven Palestinians 
were injured, one seriously, in clashes with Israeli soldiers. The 
Israeli-controlled center of Hebron has been under curfew since Wednesday, 
when two grenades were thrown at Israeli security forces, wounding 
22 people. Albright is to arrive in the Middle East on Tuesday for 
two days of talks to prepare for a summit meeting in Washington on 
Oct. 15-19. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Friday that the 
United States was trying to coax a pledge from Israel to ease settlement 
activity in exchange for assurances from the Palestinians that they 
will not encourage illegal construction. The Palestinian Cabinet, 
meanwhile, said it would call on its negotiators to ``work with all 
their ability'' to reach an accord. But in a statement Saturday following 
their late-night meeting on Friday, Palestinian ministers also called 
on Israel to approach the new round of talks ``without the delaying 
tricks of the past.'' Israeli officials have said U.S.-brokered talks 
earlier this week brought some advances toward a deal for an Israeli 
pullback from the West Bank. The latest peace efforts are shadowed 
by what Israel says is the serious danger of new attacks by Islamic 
militants. Israel closed its borders with the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
to try to stave off what Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said were 
plans for an ``unprecedented, horrific'' attack. The Islamic militant 
group Hamas, which has killed scores of Israelis in suicide bombings 
since 1994, vowed to carry out attacks after Israeli soldiers killed 
two of the group's leaders last month. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu warned Friday that security forces could not be totally 
effective in combating terror groups. ``We have to know that, during 
this fight, we will take some blows,'' Netanyahu said on public television. 
``We are working against those murderers so there will be less attacks 
or none at all.'' Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said the 
Palestinian Authority has taken sporadic steps to control Hamas, but 
``it's far short of what we would like.'' Fogel warned that an attack 
would hurt the peace process. In the past, Israel has suspended talks 
with the Palestinians after large-scale attacks by Palestinian extremists.
