Australian voters chose Saturday between a conservative incumbent 
prime minister promising an unpopular new tax and a Labor Party that 
they had cast into the political wilderness just 2 1/2 years earlier. 
About 12 million registered voters cast their ballots at thousands 
of polling booths in public buildings in towns from the nation's desert 
Outback to its tropical north and in its modern, bustling cities in 
the southeast. Prime Minister John Howard has staked his government's 
fate on what he calls ``economically radical'' tax reforms _ simplifying 
an antiquated tax structure that has built up since the 1930s. Whether 
Howard retains power rests on voters' willingness to accept a 10 percent 
tax on all goods and services. Howard's main opponent, Labor Party 
leader Kim Beazley, is promising something far less painful: to create 
500,000 new jobs. And he has used a ``no tax'' promise to pull Labor 
close enough to smell victory. Labor was thrown out in a landslide 
victory for Howard in 1996, and the historical odds are against Beazley. 
In the early counting after the polls closed, Howard's conservatives 
were being hurt by the Labor Party and also by the right-wing populist 
One Nation party, which was taking almost 10 percent of the total 
vote. But with only about 12 percent of the total vote counted, it 
was too early to tell if Labor's gains would be enough to take government 
from Howard's conservatives, or Howard would prevail with a reduced 
majority. Labor must hold all its current electorates and win 27 more 
to seize a majority in the House of Representatives, the more powerful 
chamber in Australia's bicameral Parliament. If it succeeds, Labor 
will have achieved the largest comeback in Australian election history, 
and Howard's will become the first single-term government since the 
Great Depression in the 1930s. Labor and the coalition have been in 
a dead heat for weeks, according to the polls. Casting his vote in 
his west coast electorate, Beazley said he found the latest poll difficult 
to believe and predicted there would be a clear result by late Saturday 
night. ``We've been there for over a century trying our very best 
to represent the views of ordinary Australians. Sometimes we've succeeded 
in winning their trust, sometimes we've not,'' Beazley told reporters. 
``I'm just hopeful we have managed it again tonight.'' Voting in his 
Sydney electorate, Howard said he was nervous about the outcome. ``When 
you get to this stage you just wait and see what the result is. I 
am hopeful but it will be tight. I think I confess to a few first 
night nerves,'' Howard said. Currently, Howard's governing conservatives 
hold 90 seats, Labor 49 and independents eight. Even if Howard retains 
control in the House of Representatives, where government is formed, 
polls have indicated minor parties or independents again will hold 
the balance of power in the upper house, meaning the government may 
have to negotiate to get bills passed. Howard has tried to soften 
his tax plan by linking it to income tax cuts worth Australian dollars 
13 billion (U.S. dlrs 7.6 billion) a year and has promised to abolish 
a variety of other wholesale taxes. But the income tax cuts are based 
on the uncertain assumption that the Australian economy will continue 
to grow 3.5 percent a year to keep the federal budget in surplus. 
Beazley, meanwhile, has promised to create a half-million jobs in 
three years and has called for income tax cuts targeting low-income 
earners. His proposed cuts would cost Australian dollars 3 billion 
(U.S. dlrs 1.8 billion), an amount he says would be affordable even 
under the IMF's modest growth projections. Tax was a key issue for 
voters on both sides. ``I don't like any of them but I don't want 
a GST (goods and services tax),'' said 30-year-old Chris Ireland when 
asked why he voted Labor. ``John Howard has taken the brave approach 
in taking on reform of the tax system,'' said Ian Montcrieff, a 73-year-old 
self-funded retiree. ``I'm very keen for the tax reforms to come through.''
