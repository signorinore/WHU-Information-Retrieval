Alberto Tomba announced his official retirement from skiing Saturday, 
ending a remarkable career in which he won three Olympic titles and 
a reputation for explosiveness on and off the slopes. The Italian 
known as ``La Bomba'' (The Bomb) released a statement through the 
Italian news agency ANSA. Tomba's sister Alessia, who acts as his 
spokesperson, said Friday an announcement was forthcoming, but that 
the skier would not speak to reporters about the decision. Tomba, 
31, burst onto the scene with a bronze medal at the 1987 World Championships, 
and went on to capture 1988 Olympic titles in the slalom and giant 
slalom. In 1992, he became the first Alpine skier to win the same 
Olympic event twice when he took gold in the giant slalom. Tomba also 
won silver medals in slalom at the 1992 and 1994 Olympics. Fittingly, 
Tomba leaves on a winning note. He won the last race of the 1998 season, 
the slalom at the World Cup Finals in March, for his 50th career World 
Cup win.
