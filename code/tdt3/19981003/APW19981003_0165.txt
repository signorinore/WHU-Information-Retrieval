In advance of a visit next week by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright, Palestinians on Saturday urged Israel to avoid ``delaying 
tricks'' they said have so far obstructed a new accord. Meanwhile, 
a small-scale clash broke out Saturday in the divided West Bank town 
of Hebron, where Israeli soldiers fired rubber bullets at a small 
group of stone-throwers. It has been a tense week in Hebron, which 
is home to 450 Jewish settlers and 130,000 Palestinians and a frequent 
flashpoint for violence. Albright is scheduled to arrive in the Middle 
East on Tuesday for two days of talks to prepare for a summit meeting 
in Washington on Oct. 15-19. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said 
Friday that the United States was trying to coax a pledge from Israel 
to ease settlement activity in exchange for assurances from the Palestinians 
that they will not encourage illegal construction. The Palestinian 
Cabinet, meanwhile, said it would call on its negotiators to ``work 
with all their ability'' to reach an accord. But in a statement Saturday 
following their late-night meeting on Friday, Palestinian ministers 
also called on Israel to approach the new round of talks ``without 
the delaying tricks of the past.'' Israeli officials have said U.S.-brokered 
talks earlier this week brought some advances toward a deal for an 
Israeli pullback from the West Bank. The latest peace efforts are 
shadowed by what Israel says is the serious danger of new attacks 
by Islamic militants. Israel closed its borders with the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip to try to stave off what Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai 
said were plans for an ``unprecedented, horrific'' attack. The Islamic 
militant group Hamas, which has killed scores of Israelis in suicide 
bombings since 1994, vowed to carry out attacks after Israeli soldiers 
killed two of the group's leaders last month.
