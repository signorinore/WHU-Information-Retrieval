South Korean veteran Ku Ok-hee shot an even-par 72 Saturday and shared 
a one-stroke lead with Mayumi Murai going into the final round of 
the 60 million yen (dlrs 441,000) Kosaido Ladies. Murai, an overnight 
co-leader, went around in 73 for a 36-hole total of 2-under 142. Ku 
chipped in a 12-meter (40-foot) wedge shot for birdie on the par-5 
18th that moved her into the tie with her playing partner Murai, who 
parred the final hole. Ku, seeking her second title this season and 
15th overall on the Japan tour, had a round of four birdies, two bogeys 
and a double bogey over the 6,257-yard (5,694-meter), par-72 Chiba 
Kosaido Country Club course. ``The top two money-winners aren't competing 
here so I'm aiming for it,'' said Ku, referring to Michiko Hattori, 
who is leading the money list, and Akiko Fukushima, who stands behind 
Hattori. ``There aren't many low scores yielded because of the windy 
weather out there. So I'll just try to play in a consistent pace tomorrow,'' 
Ku added. Murai, in contention for her first victory in two years 
and seventh overall, scattered three birdies, two bogeys and a double 
bogey. ``I'm not thinking about winning,'' said Murai, who last won 
in the 1996 Chukyo TV-Bridgeston. ``If I do, that would make me over-swing.'' 
One stroke back at 143 came Aki Takamura, who fired the day's best 
round of 69 with five birdies and two bogeys. Kiyoe Yamazaki shot 
a 73 and Nayoko Yoshikawa a 74 to share fourth at even-par 144. Aiko 
Takasu, the other overnight co-leader, struggled to a 77 for a share 
of seventh at 146. A total of 52 survived the cut at 8-over 152.
