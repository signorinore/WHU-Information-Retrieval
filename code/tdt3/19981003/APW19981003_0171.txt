Three key players in today's national elections in Australia: ___ 
Prime Minister John Howard, 59: Liberal Party leader who has endured 
more setbacks in his 25-year political career than almost anyone else 
in Parliament, surviving to become prime minister in 1996. Son of 
a Sydney garage owner who started his career as a suburban lawyer. 
___ Kim Beazley, 49: Thrust into Labor Party leadership to rebuild 
the party after it was routed 1996. Considered a uniting force who 
could calm factional rivalries within party. Has kept Labor near even 
with Liberal Party in polls throughout the campaign. Entered Parliament 
in 1980 after a brief career as a university lecturer. ___ Pauline 
Hanson, 44: One Nation party leader who rode on a swell of popular 
support following her 1996 inaugural speech in Parliament. Lately, 
party has sunk in polls; Hanson could lose her Parliament seat. One 
Nation, however, could influence which party wins in closely contested 
districts. Critics call her racist for her opposition to Asian immigration 
and social programs for Aborigines. Former fish-and-chips shop owner 
whose previous political experience was as a city councilor.
