ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Doctors at public hospitals in Athens returned 
to work Saturday after their union suspended a lengthy strike which 
had seriously disrupted health services in the capital. The main hospital 
doctors' union, EINAP, agreed Friday to hold two weeks of talks with 
the government before voting on whether to re-start the protest. Doctors 
are demanding higher pay and benefits. They say government reforms 
to make hospitals more efficient are too hasty and require more state 
funding. Only emergency cases were treated during the strikes, held 
on and off since Sept. 11. Patients gathered daily outside the closed 
hospital gates to plead for treatment. However, five hospitals in 
greater Athens defied their union's decision and continued striking.
