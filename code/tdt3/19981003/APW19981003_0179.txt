Amid the worst economic crisis since independence, President Robert 
Mugabe has awarded himself, his Cabinet and lawmakers pay raises of 
up to 25 percent. The raises, announced Friday and which are retroactive 
to July, comes as 12.7 million ordinary Zimbabweans are battling runaway 
inflation and a 60 percent loss in spending power of their Zimbabwe 
dollars against the U.S. dollar in the past year. Mugabe's tax-free 
pay and allowances package rises 20 percent to ZWD 507,000 (U.S. dlrs 
15,134) a year. The salaries of Mugabe's ministers go up 20 percent 
while those of legislators in the 150 seat chamber _ all but three 
belonging to Mugabe's ruling party _ rise an average 25 percent.
