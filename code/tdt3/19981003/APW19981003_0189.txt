German automaker BMW announced Saturday it will set up a wholly-owned 
manufacturing plant in eastern Thailand to assemble BMW and Rover 
group vehicles. It will also establish a wholesale subsidiary, Bayerische 
Motoren Werke (Thailand), to handle distribution of its vehicles, 
BMW executives said at a news conference. BMW's new plant, representing 
an initial investment of more than 1 billion baht (dlrs 25.3 million), 
will be located at an industrial park in Thailand's Eastern Seaboard. 
It is scheduled to start operations in early 2000, employing 250 people 
in vehicle assembly during the first year of production. By 2004, 
it is slated to have 500-600 employees and an annual capacity of 10,000 
units. By establishing a wholly-owned manufacturing company _ and 
a wholesale subsidiary which is legally a joint venture but in practice 
controlled by BMW _ the automaker has substantially altered its 35-year 
relationship with its former Thai importer and distributor, the locally-owned 
Thai Yarnyon. The Thai company has also been assembling some BMW models 
since 1973, steadily expanding capacity. BMW board member Wolfgang 
Reitzle said his company ``will maintain the relationship and ensure 
business of the group's long-term partners in Thailand,'' including 
Thai Yarnyon, by sourcing painted bodies from their existing facilities 
for final assembly at the new plant. ``In the past, both partners 
have substantially invested in these facilities to meet BMW's worldwide 
quality standards,'' he said. But concern has been expressed in some 
quarters that BMW may have negotiated too hard a bargain. Thai Deputy 
Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul wrote a letter to BMW Chairman Bernd 
Pischetsrieder in January describing the decision to establish BMW 
Thailand as ``encouraging news,'' but noting that ``unfortunately, 
it does not yet include the contemplated participation of your local 
assembly and distribution partner, Thai Yarnyon.'' Thai Yarnyon has 
no equity interest in the new ventures, whose Thai partners exist 
for legal reasons but are not, apparently, actual investors. According 
to auto industry sources, a joint venture agreement concerning production 
was signed in March 1997 between BMW and Thai Yarnyon but was abrogated 
by BMW shortly afterwards for reasons that are unclear. In June this 
year, the German-Thai Chamber of Commerce also sent a letter to BMW's 
management, expressing concern that its dealings with Thai Yarnyon 
could become a source of ill-will, and urging the German company to 
seek a ``middle way'' on the issue of purchasing the outstanding stock 
of 3,000 BMW cars held by the Thai company. The stock represents a 
major financial burden for Thai Yarnyon, since the vehicles were purchased 
from BMW using bank credit. Thailand's economic crisis has slowed 
sales to a crawl, disrupting cash-flow and making it difficult to 
repay the loans.
