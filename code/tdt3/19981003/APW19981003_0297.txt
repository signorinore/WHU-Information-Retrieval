Western powers have blown the Kosovo crisis out of all proportion, 
and the price of possible NATO military strikes in the Serb province 
will be paid by neighboring countries, Greece said Saturday. Speaking 
in this home of the ancient oracle during the first day of a trilateral 
meeting between leaders of Greece, Romania and Bulgaria, Greek Foreign 
Minister Theodoros Pangalos prophesied increasing problems for the 
Balkan peninsula. The Kosovo crisis is of ``limited dimensions and 
concerns only one country and is one problem,'' Pangalos said. ``Many 
people are taking decisions for what is happening in the Balkans, 
but the final price is paid for by the three countries meeting here.'' 
The trilateral meeting is being held just days before United Nations 
Secretary General Kofi Annan is to submit a report on Yugoslav compliance 
with a Security Council resolution, essentially demanding an end to 
the Kosovo offensive by Serbian police and the Yugoslav army. The 
resolution threatens unspecified further action, seen by many as the 
decision NATO needs for military intervention. Romania, Bulgaria and 
Greece are concerned that an escalation of the crisis could lead to 
a region-wide war. But they have all expressed opposition to military 
intervention, fearing a repeat of the Bosnian war and the sanctions 
that harmed their economies. ``Our three countries have an interest 
and an imperative duty to contribute with all their strength to ease 
the crisis which will have generally unfavorable consequences for 
all the countries,'' Pangalos said. ``We are showing our intention 
to contribute peacefully to the solution of problems around us which 
directly concern us,'' he added. Greek Premier Costas Simitis said 
that European countries ``have to take actions if necessary; positive 
actions, not negative actions if they see that between the countries 
of the region there is a common will to overcome problems.'' Presidents 
Petar Stoyanov of Bulgaria and Emil Constantinescu of Romania will 
be holding extensive discussions on Kosovo with Simitis at this ancient 
site, located on a rocky and forested mountain 180 kilometers (112 
miles) north of Athens. Another key issue of the meeting is Bulgaria 
and Romania's applications for entry into the European Union and NATO. 
Greece, which is a member of both organizations, has been pushing 
the candidacies in the hope of increasing stability in the volatile 
Balkans. The two countries ``are in a far better position to enter 
the EU than many other candidates that are discussing now with the 
EU,'' Simitis said. ``We think that there could be far more stability 
in Europe and in the region if all three countries could participate 
in these two European and international schemes,'' he added. NATO 
and EU enlargement must encompass as many countries as possible, Simitis 
noted. ``A narrow enlargement would cause further division in the 
continent,'' the Greek premier said. ``The enlargement should be broad 
based and should promote security and stability in the whole region.''
