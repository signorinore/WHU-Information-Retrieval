A pediatrics organization expressed regret Saturday for not having 
defended hundreds of colleagues persecuted, expelled or murdered by 
the Nazis from 1933-45. The president of the German Society for Pediatrics, 
Lothar Pelz, acknowledged that the majority of pediatricians of the 
era accepted the Nazis' principle of ``Aryanization,'' expropriating 
Jewish businesses and other assets. Most of that generation of doctors 
``did not resist as more than 700 Jewish or politically unacceptable 
colleagues saw their existence destroyed,'' Pelz said. Later generations, 
he said, kept silent. Speaking at a gathering honoring colleagues 
persecuted by the Nazis, Pelz said it was time to ``publicly acknowledge 
and to express regret.'' The shame, ``of those events has not been 
eased,'' he said, adding that he hoped that recalling ``the fate of 
our politically persecuted, expelled and murdered colleagues'' would 
awaken the consciousness of future generations. The German Society 
for Pediatrics did not officially adopt Aryanization as a policy, 
according to historians researching the society's Nazi-era policies. 
However, researchers said the society used ``internal tactics'' to 
expel non-Aryan doctors.
