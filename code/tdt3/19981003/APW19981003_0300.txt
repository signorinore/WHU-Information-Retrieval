One Muslim returnee was killed and three others injured when in a 
series of explosions outside of Muslim homes in a southern Bosnian 
village, international officials said Saturday. The first explosion 
occurred late Friday, when an unidentified attacker threw a handgrenade 
out of a passing car, said Kelly Moore, spokeswoman for the United 
Nations in Bosnia. The grenade rolled under a car parked in front 
of a Muslim-owned house and exploded. A group of seven Muslims and 
one Croat were standing in front of the house, one was killed and 
three others injured, including 60-year-old Sakir Kudra. ``Had (the 
bomb) not rolled under the car, more of us would be dead,'' said Kudra. 
The victim was identified as Adem Muminagic, 60. Moore said four other 
attacks on Muslim houses in the village of Tasovcici, 100 kilometers 
(62 miles) south of Sarajevo, also occurred late Friday and early 
Saturday. Noone was injured in these attacks. Chris Riley, a spokesman 
for Bosnian's top international official, Carlos Westendorp, said 
his office ``strongly condemns the violence'' and holds the local 
police and political leadership responsible for the security of all 
citizens. Some Muslims had returned two days ago to their homes Tasovcici, 
in the Croat-dominated region of the Muslim-Croat Federation, under 
an agreement between local officials. Under the 1995 Dayton Peace 
agreement, Bosnia is divided into the Serb republic and the joint 
Muslim-Croat federation. Clashes between the Muslims and the Croats 
have plagued the federation since its founding. Incidents have increased 
in the region since Muslim refugees began returning to the homes they 
were forced to flee during fighting between Muslims and Croats in 
1993. According to Himzo Saric, representative of the Muslims in Tasovcici, 
the latest incidents will not prevent the some 80 Muslim families 
from returning to their homes in the sensitive region. Also Saturday, 
the head of the United Nations mission in Bosnia Elisabeth Rehn went 
to Mostar Saturday to meet with local leaders and international officials 
to discuss the region's security situation.
