Japan's top foreign-born sumo wrestler Akebono and wife Christina 
Reiko Kalina held a gala, 1,300-guest wedding ceremony at a Tokyo 
hotel Saturday. U.S. Ambassador to Japan Thomas Foley and his wife 
Heather acted as official go-betweens for the ceremony, and a telegram 
from U.S. President Bill Clinton was read. The Hawaii-born wrestler 
and Kalina officially married in April in Tokyo and had a baby daughter 
in May. The ceremony and reception for Kalina and the 204-centimeter 
(6-foot-8), 232-kilogram (516-pound) Akebono, formerly known as Chad 
Rowan, was nationally televised. ``Akebono, you needed only five years 
to become yokozuna. Please take time to build your life with your 
wonderful companion,'' said Tokitsukaze, chairman of the Japan Sumo 
Association, using the term for sumo grand champion. Clad in traditional 
Japanese wedding attire of a golden ``hakama'' skirt and a white crested 
kimono, Akebono told reporters: ``I hope to make a family that is 
bright and full of friends who will visit often.'' Akebono met Kalina, 
a teacher at the American school on the U.S. military base in Yokota, 
40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Tokyo, in 1988. Her American 
father serves in the U.S. military and her mother is Japanese.
