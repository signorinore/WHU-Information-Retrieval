Germany honored its ``unification chancellor,'' Helmut Kohl, on Saturday 
for bringing the country together eight years ago, while noting that 
serious problems that resulted _ like high unemployment _ remain to 
be solved. The nation's double-digit jobless rate, especially acute 
in the former communist east, was the main reason behind Kohl's election 
defeat last weekend. And chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder did not 
shy away from the subject in his address at ceremonies to mark German 
Unification Day. ``Today is not a day on which something should be 
glossed over or talked away,'' he said as Kohl looked impassively 
on. ``Above all, (conquering) mass unemployment remains our main task.'' 
But Schroeder also used the opportunity to express his ``respect'' 
for Kohl's crowning achievement in 16 years as chancellor: reunifying 
Germany. ``I think this is a good moment to remind people about that,'' 
he said. ``And I'm sure the people of Germany won't forget it.'' His 
words brought sustained applause from the hundreds of invited guests. 
``Kohl lost the election, but that doesn't change what he's done for 
Germany,'' one guest, Peter Imhoff, a state official in Hesse, said 
afterward. Kohl sat in the front row during the official ceremony 
at the Hanover congress center, but did not speak. In a statement 
issued earlier, he praised all that Germany had accomplished in bringing 
east and west together since 1990's unification. ``What we've attained 
with each other in the past eight years is unprecedented in history,'' 
he said. Schroeder, who led the Social Democrats' defeat of Kohl last 
week, played host to the national celebrations in his role as president 
of parliament's upper house. Czech President Vaclav Havel, the guest 
of honor, said German unification ``was good for the whole world'' 
because it meant the end of an ``evil''' system of communism. But 
Schroeder noted the economic and social upheaval that followed the 
demise of East Germany has given rise to another danger: growing support 
for neo-Nazi ideas, especially among disoriented youth. Germany can 
be proud that no far-right party even came close to winning parliamentary 
seats in last week's election, he said. ``But that shouldn't lead 
us to lose sight of the causes'' that lead young people above all 
to vote for such parties, he said. ``Radicalism always feeds itself 
on the fears and insecurities in times of dramatic change'' _ not 
just unification, but the tougher competition brought about by globalization. 
Schroeder, who was expected to be sworn in as chancellor at the end 
of the month, called for more attention to history and to more job 
and training opportunities for young people. The ceremony was preceded 
by a political fight over an original musical work mixing portions 
of the German national anthem and the one used in communist East Germany. 
Conservatives accused Schroeder, whose state government commissioned 
the piece, of desecrating the national anthem and insulting the victims 
of East Germany's totalitarian regime. Bavarian leaders boycotted 
the ceremony. But even Kohl, who was among the critics, clapped politely 
when ``Variations on the Theme Germany'' was played. And German President 
Roman Herzog dismissed the fuss as overblown. ``Our state can endure 
that, and its symbols, when we value them enough,'' he said. The people 
of former East Germany will be remembered not by their old anthem, 
he said, but by the chant heard during the candlelight marches that 
eventually brought down the communist leaders: ``We are the people.''
