Despite the economic crisis, Malaysia will open the first of three 
electronic hospitals with state-of-the-art medical facilities next 
year, a news report said Saturday. The 530 million ringgit (dlrs 132 
million) hospital outside Kuala Lumpur will be the first in the world 
with comprehensive electronic facilities, Minister of Health Chua 
Jui Meng was quoted as saying by national news agency Bernama. It 
will have 960 beds. The government has allocated about 2 billion ringgit 
(500 million) to build three electronic hospitals by 2000. The hospitals 
will conduct administration and carry out medical examinations using 
multimedia and Information Technology services without using much 
paper or film. Chua said the three hospitals would provide tele-medicine 
and tele-health services to enable patients in Malaysia to consult 
foreign medical experts without having to go abroad.
