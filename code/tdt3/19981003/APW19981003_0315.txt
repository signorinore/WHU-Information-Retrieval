Less than two weeks ahead of fresh talks with its uneasy neighbor 
India, Pakistan pressed on Saturday for international mediation in 
the thorny Kashmir issue, the flashpoint of two previous wars between 
the two countries. India has rejected international involvement in 
what it considers a bilateral issue. The two countries have been at 
odds over ownership of a united Kashmir, which was divided between 
India and Pakistan when the Asian subcontinent gained independence 
from Britain in 1947. ''The bilateral dialogue in the past has not 
yielded positive results. Only third party mediation has proved fruitful,'' 
foreign ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf said in Islamabad. Pakistan 
and India resume stalled talks on Kashmir in Islamabad on Oct. 15. 
Kashmir is the only Muslim majority state in Hindu-dominated India. 
The three-day talks are also meant to ease tensions between these 
two newest nuclear powers and for the discussion of confidence-building 
measures. Tensions in South Asia escalated after India conducted a 
series of nuclear tests in May and Pakistan matched them with a similar 
series the same month. Altaf said Islamabad did not expect quick results 
from its talks with India. ''Our aim, nevertheless, is to sincerely 
attempt to find a just settlement of ... the dispute,'' he said. He 
said once the Kashmir problem is resolved, there will be ''unlimited 
possibilities of cooperation and normal and good relations'' between 
the two countries.
