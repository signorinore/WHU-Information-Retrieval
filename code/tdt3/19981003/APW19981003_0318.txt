The monkey clapped, the donkey waved its ears and the eagle flapped 
its wings as, one-by-one, they and a host of other pets were blessed 
Saturday at a special church service celebrating all God's creatures. 
The Rev. Ernest Hunt intoned the opening of the service at the American 
Cathedral of the Holy Trinity after a rousing chorus of ``All Things 
Bright and Beautiful.'' Pets ``love us regardless of how we dress, 
how successful we are or how much money we have,'' he said. The service, 
conducted in French and English, was in honor of St. Francis of Assisi, 
that renowned animal lover, and included several special prayers and 
Bible readings in honor of animals. Among the creatures in attendance 
were two baby panthers, a llama, a pony and little goats, along with 
an array of cats and dogs. ``I was here last year and enjoyed it a 
lot,'' said Michael Flaesch, ``and so did my eagle, Colorado,'' who 
parked his claws on Flaesch's shoulder under the church's sculpted 
lectern eagle. Desire Rech, from the Kinos Circus, was also happy 
with the service, just like his sweat-shirted monkey who clapped with 
apparent delight. ``We had such a great turnout at our first event 
last year that we decided to repeat it,'' Hunt said. Veterinarian 
Michel Klein, who also works at the Paris School of Guide Dogs for 
the Blind, gave a homily to man's best friend, ``so often giving the 
only real affection to lonely people in today's society,'' Then, one 
by one, the animals were blessed at the choir steps, before the final 
hymn, ``All Creatures of our God and King.'' ``Vladimir loved it, 
didn't you, Vladdie?'' said Noelle d'Aulnay, cooing to her poodle. 
The animals were more curious than flustered, with only a tiny puddle 
betraying one dog's nervousness.
