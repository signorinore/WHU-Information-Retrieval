Claudia Schiffer says she won't be parading down the catwalks any 
more. She'd rather design the clothes the other top models are wearing 
on them. Surrounded by photographers and TV crews, the German superstar 
of fashion runways told reporters in Milan as the latest shows kicked 
off that she intends to become a designer herself. ``I love fashion 
but I never really liked the runway,'' she was quoted as saying in 
Saturday's Il Messaggero, a Rome daily. ``Cinema and advertising are 
much better. I'm leaving.'' But Schiffer's blond locks might not entirely 
be absent from the runways. She came to Milan to model the Marchese 
Coccapani collection for ``my friend Giorgio Ferrari,'' and, ``for 
him, I'll always come.'' She showed up to model just one Coccapani 
number on Friday, a silver-colored knit sheath. Schiffer has lots 
of commercial interests, ranging from filming a series of exercise 
tapes to doing ads for cosmetics and automobiles, including one spot 
in which she flings a pair of panties out a car window.
