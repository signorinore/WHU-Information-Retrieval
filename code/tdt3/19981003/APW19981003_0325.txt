With a global economic crisis looming and conflicts creating turmoil 
in more than 30 hotspots, world leaders came to the United Nations 
over the past two weeks _ and made some surprising moves towards easing 
global tensions. After detonating nuclear devices in May, India and 
Pakistan announced plans to adhere to the nuclear test ban treaty 
within the next year, which would slow the South Asian arms race. 
Benjamin Netanyahu announced Israel will shortly hand over 13 percent 
of the West Bank to the Palestinians, and Yasser Arafat backed down 
from unilaterallly declaring that a Palestinian state would be in 
place by May 4, 1999, the deadline for implementing the Middle East 
peace accords. Iran's moderate government distanced itself from a 
dlrs 2.5 million reward for killing Salman Rushdie, author of ``The 
Satanic Verses'' which religious leaders claimed blasphemed Islam, 
prompting a positive response from Western ministers. Nigeria's new 
leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, committed his military government 
to fair elections and a return to civilian rule next year, key Western 
demands to end the country's pariah status. Still, many of the world's 
conflicts showed no signs of cooling down. There was no progress on 
reunification of Cyprus, divided since 1974 when Turkey occupied the 
north of the island nation. The border conflict between Ethiopia and 
Eritrea remained tense. Congo accused neighboring Rwanda and Uganda 
of invading the country and massacring thousands of innocent Congolese. 
Rwanda and Uganda denied the allegations and blamed Congo for slaughtering 
innocent men, women and children. And the threat of NATO military 
strikes against Serb targets in Kosovo grew, following the broadcast 
and publication of gruesome pictures of massacred ethnic Albanians. 
Survivors blamed Serb forces trying to crush independence-seeking 
ethnic Albanians. The U.N. Security Council on Thursday condemned 
the massacres, but didn't assign blame or add any new legal backing 
for any NATO action. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic denied 
any new attacks in Kosovo and insisted his country wanted ``direct, 
unconditional'' dialogue with the ethnic Albanians _ which they have 
rejected _ to resolve the conflict peacefully. Old Cold War opponents 
still shouted at each other. North Korea, the most rigid remaining 
communist state, accused its South Korean rivals of being ``running 
dogs'' of the Americans. And the Cubans and Americans volleyed in 
the assembly debate for two rounds over the U.S. embargo and the refusal 
of the Western hemisphere's only communist state to hold democratic 
elections. With a new millennium just two years away, many leaders 
wondered aloud how the international community can deal with the issues 
heaped on the global plate _ from the growing number of conflicts 
in Africa to the growing gap between rich and poor and the growing 
threat of international terrorism. ``Mankind is increasingly feeling 
the breathing of the 21st century,'' said Russian Foreign Minister 
Igor Ivanov. Nations will live ``in peace and harmony'' once they 
recognize their interdependence and start to seek collective responses 
to the challenges of the time, he said. Eager to forge a more collective 
response, many nations suggested ways for reforming the U.N. Security 
Council to make it more representative of the world _ and more responsive 
to the needs of developing countries. But talk of expanding the council 
_ effectively the U.N. board of directors _ is hopelessly stalled 
over who should get to join the exclusive club. And the growth of 
global financial markets, the inter-linked national economies and 
the spreading economic crisis has no easy solution. ``The poorest 
countries are the traumatized victims of this reality; but the whole 
world community can be threatened by a situation that will affect 
even the most advanced countries,'' Ivanov said.
