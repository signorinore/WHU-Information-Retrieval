Thailand's justice ministry will propose amending the country's tough 
abortion law to give HIV-infected women the right to end their pregnancies, 
a local newspaper reported Saturday. The right will also apply in 
cases where fetuses are diagnosed with physical and mental disabilities, 
the Bangkok Post reported. The proposal, to be announced next Tuesday 
by the ministry, calls for abortions to be granted only with the consent 
of both the mother and a doctor. Under the current law, abortions 
can legally be carried out by qualified doctors only on rape victims 
or to protect the mother's health. A report from the country's leading 
medical institution, Mahidol University, said 62,000 babies are expected 
to contract HIV from their mothers by 2000, and 47,000 of these are 
expected to develop full-blown AIDS, the Post reported. Past attempts 
to amend the abortion law have run into stiff opposition from religious 
groups and conservative politicians.
