A Serb-appointed interim council for Kosovo announced Saturday it 
would work to ``normalize conditions'' in the province, where Serbian 
authorities are eager to show world leaders their interest in a peaceful 
solution to the bloody conflict. The Serbs are anxious to avoid NATO 
airstrikes and are making last ditch efforts to show their progress 
towards ending the conflict. But ethnic Albanian political leaders 
have rejected the council as a ``body formed by Serbian authorities,'' 
not a body that would be part of Kosovo self-rule. The body, appointed 
by the Serbian parliament last week, includes a Serb prime minister 
and an 17 other governing members, comprised of both Serbs and ethnic 
Albanians and is envisaged as an interim government to deal with local 
issues in Kosovo. ``Our task is to normalize conditions as soon as 
possible and create conditions for local elections in Kosovo,'' Zoran 
Andjelkovic, the council's prime minister said at Saturday's opening 
session. ``I hope we will not last for a very long time, because that 
means we will be successful.''
