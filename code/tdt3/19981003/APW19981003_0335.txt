The Alpine ski lift whose line was sliced by a U.S. Marine jet in 
February, sending 20 people to their deaths, will reopen by Christmas. 
Officials from the northern area of Trento said Saturday the cable 
line and gondolas had been completely rebuilt and would be taking 
skiers up Mount Cermis. The exact opening date depends on when the 
first snow of the season falls. The lift departs from Cavalese, a 
town in a region whose economy is based primarily on tourism and which 
suffered a major blow following the Feb. 3 tragedy. Evidence showed 
the Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler, which took off from a nearby base, 
was flying too fast and too low when it sliced the cable. The United 
States has provided funds to the victims' families as well as to the 
Trento region to help restore tourism. The jet's pilot and navigator 
face a court-martial this winter on 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter 
and negligent homicide, as well as dereliction of duty, destroying 
military property and destroying civilian property.
