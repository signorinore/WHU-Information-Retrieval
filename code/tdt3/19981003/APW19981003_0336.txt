Clashes broke out in the center of the West Bank town of Hebron on 
Saturday just after the Israeli army briefly lifted a curfew to allow 
people to shop. Two Palestinians were hurt. It marked the fourth day 
of skirmishing in Hebron, which is home to 450 Jewish settlers and 
130,000 Palestinians and is a frequent flashpoint for violence. On 
Friday, seven Palestinians were injured, one seriously, in clashes 
with Israeli soldiers. The Israeli-controlled center of town has been 
under curfew since Wednesday, when two grenades were thrown at Israeli 
security forces, wounding 22 people. Saturday's fighting broke out 
just after the army called a three-hour break in the curfew. A group 
of Palestinians threw stones near a Jewish settlement in the center 
of town and Israeli troops responded with rubber bullets, wounding 
two Palestinians. One of the injured Palestinians was taken into custody 
by the Israeli troops, to cheers from settlers looking on. The latest 
clashes come three days before the scheduled arrival of U.S. Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright, who was to visit the region to try to 
follow through on U.S.-brokered talks last week aimed at setting terms 
for an Israeli pullback from the West Bank. Accompanied by mediator 
Dennis Ross, Albright was to arrive in the Middle East on Tuesday 
to prepare for an Israeli-Palestinian summit in Washington on Oct. 
15-19. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Friday that in advance 
of that, the United States was trying to coax a pledge from Israel 
to ease settlement activity in exchange for assurances from the Palestinians 
that they will not encourage illegal construction. The Palestinian 
Cabinet, meanwhile, said it would call on its negotiators to ``work 
with all their ability'' to reach an accord. But in a statement Saturday 
following their late-night meeting on Friday, Palestinian ministers 
also called on Israel to approach the new round of talks ``without 
the delaying tricks of the past.'' The latest peace efforts are shadowed 
by what Israel says is the serious danger of new attacks by Islamic 
militants. Israel closed its borders with the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
to try to stave off what Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said were 
plans for an ``unprecedented, horrific'' attack. The Islamic militant 
group Hamas, which has killed scores of Israelis in suicide bombings 
since 1994, vowed to carry out attacks after Israeli soldiers killed 
two of the group's leaders last month. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu warned on Friday that security forces could not be totally 
effective in combating terror groups. ``We have to know that, during 
this fight, we will take some blows,'' Netanyahu said on public television. 
``We are working against those murderers so there will be less attacks 
or none at all.'' Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said the 
Palestinian Authority has taken sporadic steps to control Hamas, but 
``it's far short of what we would like.'' Fogel warned that an attack 
would hurt the peace process. In the past, Israel has suspended talks 
with the Palestinians after large-scale attacks by Palestinian extremists.
