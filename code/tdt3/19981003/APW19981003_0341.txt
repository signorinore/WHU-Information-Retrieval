Author Taslima Nasrin, who faces death threats from religious extremists 
and a warrant for her arrest, sought world intervention Saturday to 
assure her safety in Bangladesh. ``I need protection for my life. 
The international community should come forward to ensure my safety,'' 
Nasrin, 36, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from 
her hideout. She said she appealed to the British chapter of the international 
writers' group PEN to contact the Bangladesh government and protect 
her from Islamic extremists who have offered a reward of 200,000 takas 
(dlrs 5,000) to anyone who kills her. On Saturday, nearly 2,000 Islamic 
extremists, wearing white prayer caps, marched through the streets 
of Dhaka chanting death threats to Nasrin. ``We shall try the infidel 
on the soil of Bangladesh and put her to death,'' read a banner waved 
by protesters from the Islamic Constitution Movement. After a 4-year 
self-imposed exile, Nasrin returned home from New York in September 
and said she wanted to nurse her 60-year-old mother, who has colon 
cancer. ``I want my freedom back,'' Nasrin said. ``This is my country 
and I've every right to freely live here.'' After the state filed 
charges against her in 1994 for blaspheming Islam, Nasrin went into 
hiding for two months to avoid death threats until a court granted 
her bail and allowed her to leave the country. Since then, she has 
lived in Europe and the United States, supported by PEN. Ten days 
after her homecoming, a Dhaka magistrate revived another 1994 arrest 
warrant issued in a civil suit, filed in addition to the state-sponsored 
criminal case. Her return prompted renewed street protests by Islamic 
conservatives who call for her death by public hanging, even though 
the offense she is accused of carries a maximum punishment of two 
years in jail. An alliance of several Islamic groups planned a bigger 
protest in the Bangladeshi capital for Sunday.
