Less than two weeks ahead of fresh talks with its uneasy neighbor 
India, Pakistan pressed on Saturday for international mediation in 
the thorny Kashmir issue, the flashpoint of two previous wars between 
the two countries. India has rejected international involvement in 
what it considers a bilateral issue. The two countries have been at 
odds over ownership of a united Kashmir, which was divided between 
India and Pakistan when the Asian subcontinent gained independence 
from Britain in 1947. ''The bilateral dialogue in the past has not 
yielded positive results. Only third party mediation has proved fruitful,'' 
foreign ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf said in Islamabad. In Delhi, 
an Indian government spokesman was not immediately available for comment.
