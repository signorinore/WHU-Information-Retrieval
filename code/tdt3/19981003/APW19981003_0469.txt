One Muslim was killed and three others injured in a series of explosions 
outside of Muslim homes in a southern Bosnian village, international 
officials said Saturday. The first explosion occurred late Friday, 
when an unidentified attacker threw a hand grenade out of a passing 
car, said Kelly Moore, spokeswoman for the United Nations in Bosnia. 
The grenade rolled under a car parked in front of a Muslim-owned house, 
where seven Muslims and one Croat were standing. One of the Muslims 
was killed when the device exploded and three others were injured, 
including 60-year-old Sakir Kudra. ``Had (the bomb) not rolled under 
the car, more of us would be dead,'' said Kudra. The victim was identified 
as Adem Muminagic, 60. Moore said four other attacks on Muslim houses 
in the village of Tasovcici, 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of Sarajevo, 
also occurred late Friday and early Saturday. No one was injured in 
these attacks. Chris Riley, a spokesman for Bosnia's top international 
official, Carlos Westendorp, said his office ``strongly condemns the 
violence'' and holds the local police and political leadership responsible 
for the security of all citizens. Some 40 Muslim families have returned 
in the past few days to their homes in Tasovcici, in the Croat-dominated 
region of the Muslim-Croat Federation, under an agreement between 
local officials. Himzo Saric, representative of the Muslims in Tasovcici, 
said 80 more families are scheduled to return to their homes in the 
region by the end of the month. He stressed that the latest attacks 
would not prevent their return. Under the 1995 Dayton Peace agreement, 
Bosnia is divided into the Serb republic and the Muslim-Croat Federation. 
Clashes between the Muslims and the Croats have plagued the federation 
since its founding. Also Saturday, Elisabeth Rehn, the head of the 
United Nations mission in Bosnia, went to the southwestern city of 
Mostar Saturday to meet with local leaders and international officials 
to discuss the region's security situation. In a statement released 
later Saturday, the United Nations expressed strong concern over the 
events in Tasovici and empasized its commitment to returning refugees 
to their pre-war homes. The U.N. police force has also increased its 
presence in the region, the statement said.
