Greg Turner of New Zealand and Sweden's Fredric Jacobson on Saturday 
shared the lead of the Belgian Belgacom Open at 12-under par going 
into the final round. England's Lee Westwood was just one stroke back. 
Turner shot a four-under par 67 in cold and damp conditions to make 
up two strokes on Jacobson. Westwood, currently No. 2 in the European 
Tour Order of Merit, also snuck closer to the lead with a 67 and maintained 
his chances to rob Scot Colin Montgomerie, a no-show here, of the 
Order of Merit title during the season-ending Volvo Masters at the 
end of the month. Jacobson, who has been troubled by back pains this 
week, shot a 69 and is in a prime position to finish in the top eight 
to guarantee his Tour card next season. Sweden's Jarmo Sandelin and 
Germany Sven Struver were two shots off the pace at 10-under. Westwood 
has been eyeing the 66,600 pound (dlrs 113,000) top prize here would 
bring him within striking distance of Montgomerie. He is currently 
112,000 pounds (dlrs 190,000) behind Montgomerie's leading 760,077 
pounds (dlrs 1.29 million). Two victories in the last two events would 
give Westwood the Order of Merit title, whatever Montgomery did. Jacobson 
needs a good showing at the 400,000-pound (dlrs 680,000) Belgacom 
Open to hold on to his European Tour Card. He has only won 44,000 
pounds (dlrs 75,000) and needs to finish in the top eight to hold 
on to his tour card. Nick Faldo, who won the Belgian Open when it 
was last held in 1994, slumped further back on Saturday with a second 
72 in a row and was a in tie at four-under.
