While Latvians voted on a citizenship law that has sparked diplomatic 
fights between Riga and Moscow, Latvia and Russia had another battle 
Saturday _ on the soccer field. In a game that was part of a local 
tournament for diplomats, staff from the Latvian Foreign Ministry 
and the Russian Embassy squared off at midday. After playing to a 
1-1 tie in the first half, the Russians regrouped and won 3-1. Latvian 
player Toms Baumanis, press secretary at the foreign ministry, said 
the ``atmosphere of the game was fun and friendly.'' ``It increases 
our informal contacts, and that can always be helpful,'' he said.
