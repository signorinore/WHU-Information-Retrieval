Shaun Bartlett headed in Quinton Fortune's free kick in the 88th minute 
Saturday, and South Africa squeezed past an overwhelmed Angola 1-0 
in an African Cup Group Four qualifier. The Bafana Bafana hit the 
post once in each half before Bartlett redirected Fortune's 25-meter 
free kick. South Africa repeatedly threatened the Black Panthers' 
net, dominating possession but was plagued by poor finishing. The 
match was the first for South Africa in qualifying for the 2000 African 
championship. Angola had advanced to the group play by eliminating 
Benin in first-round play.
