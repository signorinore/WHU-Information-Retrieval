Prime Minister John Howard defeated Kim Beazley and the Labor Party 
in Saturday's election, but Beazley looks like the big winner in the 
long run. Beazley lost the vote, but he took a Labor Party humiliated 
and ousted by the voters just 2 1/2 years ago and brought it within 
reach of victory, a feat no one believed possible a year ago. Beazley 
knocked the conservative majority down from 91 seats in the 148-seat 
House of Representatives to perhaps 71, with vote counting still going 
on, gaining at least 17 seats for Labor. It's the biggest comeback 
since World War II for a party forced out in the previous election, 
Beazley told an ecstatic crowd in his home district of Brand, south 
of Perth. Beazley, an avuncular, heavy-set man, has won the respect 
and affection of many Australians, and is well-positioned for a victorious 
campaign in three years or less. Political analysts do not expect 
his opponent to be Howard, the putative winner Saturday. It is widely 
anticipated that Howard will be dumped in a year or so, probably by 
his ambitious treasurer, Peter Costello, who admitted in a radio interview 
just a few weeks ago that Liberal Party figures were urging him to 
challenge Howard. Costello then pledged his total loyalty to Howard 
_ typically an ominous portent for any leader. Even without having 
to watch his back, Howard may come to feel that his victory is hollow. 
He will have to fight to push his tax reform plan through the Senate, 
where his party will not hold a majority. And how Howard can keep 
his promise to cut income taxes if the economy worsens in the wake 
of the Asian crisis remains to be seen. Further, the Senate, as well 
as some backbenchers in his own Liberal Party and the National Party, 
the junior partner in his governing conservative coalition, also objects 
to his plan to sell off the government's remaining majority share 
of the national telecommunications giant Telstra Corp. But by far 
the biggest loser Saturday was right-wing populist leader Pauline 
Hanson, who predicted that she would win her own House of Representatives 
seat and that her One Nation party would win 12 to 15 House seats 
and six in the Senate. The outcome: Hanson lost her own seat, and 
One Nation won no seats in the House. It won only one Senate seat, 
in Queensland. Hanson, elected to Parliament as an independent in 
1996, had dominated Australian politics since her inaugural speech 
later that year. In it she warned that Australia was in danger of 
being ``swamped by Asians'' and opposed land rights and special welfare 
benefits for Aborigines. Hanson's response to her loss? ``I believe 
there is a lot of support for One Nation. We're not going away anywhere.''
