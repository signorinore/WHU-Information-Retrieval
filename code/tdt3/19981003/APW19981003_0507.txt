Romanian star gymnast Gina Gogean, who made a name with impeccable 
routines and stoic demeanor, has officially retired from competition, 
a news agency reported Saturday. During a gymnastics championship 
in the eastern city of Focsani, Gogean, 21, said Friday she planned 
to become an ``appreciated coach and judge,'' the news agency Mediafax 
reported. She already has an offer from the Focsani gymnastics school, 
it said. Known for her solemn expressions, Gogean won two gold medals 
- more than any other athlete - at the World Gymnastics Championships 
in Lausanne last year. Already then she indicated she was considering 
retiring, adding she could not maintain her high standard. Gogean 
was the all-round silver medalist at the Atlanta Olympic Games and 
won 30 medals in international competitions during her career. She 
is studing physical education in Timisoara, western Romania.
