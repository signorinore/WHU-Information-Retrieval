TOULOUSE, France (AP) - Greg Rusedski and Jan Siemerink, the top two 
seeds, won their semifinal matches Saturday and will meet in the final 
of the dlrs 400,000 Toulouse Open tennis tournament. Britain's Rusedski, 
the top seed and world No. 14, swept away defending champion and No. 
4 seed Nicolas Kiefer of Germany, 6-4, 6-1. Rusedski again demonstrated 
his powerful serve - at this year's India Wells tournament he served 
at 239.7 kmh (133 mph), a world record - and impressed with fine backhand 
shots, which are normally a weaker part of his game. Siemerink had 
a far tougher path to the final, beating No. 3 seed Thomas Johansson 
of Sweden, 6-3, 3-6, 7-5. Resedski and Siemink will play the championship 
match Sunday.
