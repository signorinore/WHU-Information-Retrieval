Two French warships will conduct an exercise with Kuwait's navy during 
a five-day visit to this oil-rich state, a senior French Navy official 
said Saturday. ``If one day we have to undertake a dangerous big operation 
(with the Kuwaitis), we have to be used to working together,'' said 
Rear Adm. Jean-Louis Battet, commander of the French maritime forces 
in the Indian Ocean. He was speaking to reporters on board La Somme, 
a supply and command ship that arrived Saturday along with the frigate 
La Fayette. The ships were anchored at Shuwaik Port, just west of 
Kuwait City. Battet described the one-day war games scheduled for 
Thursday as ``basic and tactical.'' Elaborate ones were being planned 
for next year, he said. He said La Somme and La Fayette will take 
part in similar exercises with the navies of Qatar, Oman and the United 
Arab Emirates. France was a member of the U.S.-led coalition that 
fought the Gulf War to evict Iraqi troops from Kuwait in February 
1991. The oil-rich Gulf state signed 10-year defense pacts with the 
United States, Britain, France and China after the war.
