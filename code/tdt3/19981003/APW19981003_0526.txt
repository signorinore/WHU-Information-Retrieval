A court on Saturday reduced a premeditated murder charge to manslaughter 
against a nurse accused of injecting 30 patients with poison. The 
ruling freed her from a death sentence imposed in an earlier trial. 
The Alexandria Criminal Court said that while Aida Nur el-Din did 
inject her patients with a ``harmful substance'' she did so ``without 
intending to kill them.'' The court did not say why Nur el-Din would 
have wanted to inject the substance, which it did not identify. Nur 
el-Din's case received wide attention in Egypt after she fell from 
the third story of a police station while being led to an interrogation 
room following her arrest in the port city of Alexandria where the 
alleged crimes were committed. She has never said whether she jumped 
or was pushed. However, in pleading innocent, the 25-year-old nurse 
said she was framed by hospital officials trying to cover their own 
negligence. The allegations also provided grist to the critics of 
the poor working and health standards at government hospitals, and 
renewed allegations by nurses nationwide that they are overworked, 
underpaid and abused by doctors. An Alexandria court sentenced Nur 
el-Din to death on March 11 after convicting her of murdering Mohammed 
Abdel-Qader Ibrahim and trying to kill 29 other patients by injecting 
them with respiratory muscle relaxants. But the Court of Cassation 
ordered a retrial in July on grounds that the trial court had failed 
to make sure that she had intended to kill Ibrahim. Nur el-Din's case 
received a boost when the prosecutor general himself told the appeals 
court that the nurse was not sure that the injections were fatal. 
Therefore, she did not have the intention to kill, he said. Nur el-Din 
will now be tried on Nov. 1 under the new charge of manslaughter, 
which carries between three to seven years of hard labor upon conviction. 
Immediately after the ruling, about 150 people, including friends, 
lawyers and relatives, burst out of the court into el-Mensheya square 
in downtown Alexandria to celebrate the ruling. Police did not block 
the hour-long celebrations.
