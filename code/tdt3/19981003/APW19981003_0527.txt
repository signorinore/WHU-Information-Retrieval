Andre Agassi saved four match points and won the last 11 games of 
the match to beat a tiring Karol Kucera in five sets Saturday and 
reach the final of the dlrs 6.7 million Grand Slam Cup. Agassi won 
7-6 (7-1), 6-7 (5-7), 2-6, 7-5, 6-0 in a match that lasted three hours 
and 40 minutes. ``I wasn't expecting that one today, that's for sure,'' 
Agassi said. ``It was real good tennis, there's no question about 
it. To win that one in five sets certainly was very satisfying.'' 
``He is a great player and a great competitor'' Agassi said of Kucera. 
The American trailed 5-2 in the fourth set and Kucera served for the 
match. But the Slovak was unable to convert four match points as his 
errors combined with some spectacular and risky shot-making by Agassi. 
Kucera sent a forehand into the net to drop the game and Agassi gained 
the momentum, winning 11 games in a row to close out the match. ``He 
started stretching his legs early in the fourth set. He was getting 
very tired. ``I felt if I could just get back into it, I certainly 
liked my chances,'' Agassi said. As Kucera began to cramp, Agassi 
took full advantage of the opportunity and never let up the pressure, 
keeping a visibly tiring Kucera constantly on the move. Kucera was 
unable to keep with up with Agassi's pace and his game collapsed. 
During changeovers, Kucera had his legs massaged by a trainer and 
he offered little resistance in the final set. Kucera said he was 
feeling tired already after the first set. ``But from 5-2 in the fourth, 
it was really bad,'' he said. ``I tried to keep the rallies as short 
as possible. I couldn't really run too much.'' While Kucera had 18 
aces, he also had 16 double-faults, including one on set point in 
the fourth and on match point. He also had 76 unforced errors. Agassi 
had seven aces and only four double-faults. Agassi could have made 
things easier for himself had he won the second set, for which he 
served twice. The last time Agassi came back from a match point to 
win the match, he said, was at the 1994 Canadian Open against David 
Wheaton. Agassi took some measure of revenge for his five-set loss 
to Kucera in the Round of 16 in last month's U.S. Open. The American 
was a wild-card entry in the tournament that nominally brings together 
players with the best records in the four Grand Slam events of the 
year _ the Australian, French and U.S. Open and Wimbledon. After the 
withdrawal of top-ranked Pete Sampras and No. 2 Patrick Rafter, organizers 
invited Agassi although his Grand Slam record this year was not good 
enough to earn him a direct spot in the 12-man field. Now, he could 
end up earning dlrs 1.3 million by winning the title. The losing men's 
finalist will get dlrs 650,000. In the second semifinal later Saturday, 
Mark Philippoussis played Marcelo Rios. Kucera is enjoying the best 
year of his career. He was a semifinalist in the Australian Open after 
beating Sampras and a quarterfinalist in the U.S. Open, rising to 
No. 6 in the rankings. Agassi has won four tournaments on the ATP 
Tour this year, although he never got past the Round of 16 at any 
of the four Grand Slams. But he has come out of a deep slump during 
which he had dropped out of the top 100. A former No. 1, Agassi is 
now ranked No. 8. He beat the only Grand Slam champion here, Australian 
Open winner Petr Korda, in the quarterfinals, remaining the only former 
Grand Slam champion in the draw. Agassi has three Grand Slam title, 
1992 Wimbledon, 1994 U.S. Open and 1995 Australian Open.
