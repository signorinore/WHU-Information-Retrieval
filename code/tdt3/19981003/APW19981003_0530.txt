The Russian Foreign Ministry said Saturday that it hoped a new fishing 
agreement with Japan will lead to cooperation in other areas. The 
agreement, which took effect Thursday, allows Japan to fish off the 
southern Kuril Islands, which are claimed by both countries. ``The 
history of Russian-Japanese ties indicates that relations in the field 
of fishing have traditionally served as an indicator of trust between 
the two countries,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. ``This 
agreement is the result of new favorable tendencies aimed at strengthening 
good-neighborliness and partnership between Russia and Japan,'' the 
statement said. The conflicting claims over the Kuril Islands, seized 
by the Soviet army at the end of World War II, have prevented Russia 
and Japan from signing a formal peace treaty ending the war.
