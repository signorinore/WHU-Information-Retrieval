Premier Costas Simitis said Saturday that not all European leaders 
are convinced that military action in Kosovo is the best way out of 
the crisis. Simitis had telephone discussions on the issue with his 
counterparts Lionel Jospin of France and Romano Prodi of Italy, as 
well as German Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder. After the calls, 
he said he was far from being convinced of the inevitability of NATO 
military action. ``I don't have this feeling, that it (strikes) is 
a fact, that it is decided and that they will go ahead. I have the 
feeling that all are troubled about the way to best deal with the 
crisis,'' Simitis said. His calls came from Delphi, home of the ancient 
oracle, during the first day of a trilateral meeting with the leaders 
of Romania and Bulgaria. Earlier, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros 
Pangalos claimed Western powers are blowing the Kosovo crisis out 
of all proportion, and neighboring countries will have to pay the 
price of possible military strikes in the Serb province. ``Many people 
are taking decisions for what is happening in the Balkans, but the 
final price is paid for by the three countries meeting here,'' Pangalos 
said. The trilateral meeting is being held days before United Nations 
Secretary General Kofi Annan is to submit a report on Yugoslav compliance 
with a Security Council resolution, essentially demanding an end to 
the Kosovo offensive by Yugoslav authorities. The resolution threatens 
unspecified further action, seen by many as the decision NATO needs 
for military intervention. Bulgaria, Romania and Greece support greater 
autonomy for Kosovo Albanians, but disagree with their demand for 
full independence, Simitis said. All three countries are concerned 
the crisis could lead to a regional war, but their opposition to military 
intervention stems from fears of a repetition of the Bosnian war and 
the sanctions that harmed their economies. ``Our three countries have 
an interest and an imperative duty to contribute with all their strength 
to ease the crisis which will have generally unfavorable consequences 
for all the countries,'' Pangalos said. Simitis noted that European 
states ``have to take actions if necessary; positive actions, not 
negative actions if they see that between the countries of the region 
there is a common will to overcome problems.'' Presidents Petar Stoyanov 
of Bulgaria and Emil Constantinescu of Romania also brought up the 
issue of their applications for entry into the European Union and 
NATO during the meeting at this ancient site, located on a rocky and 
forested mountain 180 kilometers (112 miles) north of Athens. Greece, 
which is a member of both organizations, has been pushing the candidacies 
in the hope of increasing stability in the volatile Balkans. The two 
countries ``are in a far better position to enter the EU than many 
other candidates that are discussing now with the EU,'' Simitis said. 
NATO and EU enlargement must encompass as many countries as possible, 
Simitis noted. ``A narrow enlargement would cause further division 
in the continent,'' he said. ``The enlargement should be broad based 
and should promote security and stability in the whole region.''
