Israel is not involved in any way in the current, growing confrontations 
between Turkey and Syria, a spokesman said Saturday. ``Israel is not 
a part of this dispute and is not involved in it in any way,'' said 
Defense Ministry spokesman Avi Benayahu. Turkey has amassed troops 
on the border with Syria and warned of a military confrontation following 
allegations that Syria is supporting Turkish Kurdish rebels. Damascus 
in respoonse has accused Turkey and Israel of contriving against Syria 
through their increased military cooperation. Israel and Turkey signed 
military accords in 1996 that outline joint defense maneuvers and 
grant Israel the use of Turkish air space. Israeli experts say they 
doubt the relations with Turkey are such that either army would defend 
the other in the event of confrontations with a third party.
