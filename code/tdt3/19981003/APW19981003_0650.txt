Prime Minister Tony Blair has said that he will question China's Communist 
regime over its human rights record during his visit to the country, 
Sunday Business newspaper reported. ``There is no point in denying 
we have our differences with China: over political and civil rights, 
over Tibet, over freedom of speech, the treatment of dissent, religious 
freedom, the importance of democracy,'' Sunday Business quoted Blair 
as saying in an article in the newspaper attributed to the prime minister. 
Blair departs Monday on his five-day visit to China and the former 
British colony of Hong Kong, which reverted to Chinese rule on July 
1, 1997. ``Britain and China have very different backgrounds and traditions. 
I admire China's rich history and many achievements,'' the newspaper 
quoted Blair as saying in the article. ``But I also believe that human 
rights are universal. This is bound to be discussed of course when 
I meet China's leaders.'' Blair will also talk about the Asian financial 
crisis, Hong Kong and international terrorism when he meets Premier 
Zhu Rongji, his office has said. The British leader was quoted as 
saying by the newspaper that the main purpose of his visit is to ``forge 
a new partnership for the future'' between Britain and China. ``I 
do not intend to lecture or play to the gallery. I want progress, 
not grandstanding,'' the newspaper quoted Blair as saying. ``I have 
said before and I still believe that persuasion and dialogue achieve 
more than confrontation and empty rhetoric. The peace process in Northern 
Ireland shows that talking can reconcile the seemingly irreconcilable.'' 
On Tuesday Blair will meet Chinese leaders for an official greeting 
in Tiananmen Square, scene of the 1989 government crackdown on student 
protesters. Human rights campaigners and critics in the West have 
accused China of repressing dissent in Tibet, imprisoning dissidents, 
using forced prison labor and lacking religious freedom and a free 
press. John Major, the last British prime minister, visited China 
in 1990.
