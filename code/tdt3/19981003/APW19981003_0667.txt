A French soccer official says his country is not interested in participating 
in the Confederations Cup next year if it will have to play without 
its frontline players. The warning was made by French Football Federation 
vice president Jean Verbeke upon his arrival late Friday with coach 
Henri Emile to take part in the draw Sunday for the Jan. 8-20, 1999, 
tournament. Many European leagues have recently said its clubs will 
not release its star players for the tournament because it conflict 
with their schedule. FIFA has amended its rules for the Confederations 
Cup, saying club teams need only release players for national team 
duty 48 hours before the tournament. FIFA President Joseph Blatter 
had planned to attend Sunday's draw here, but canceled the trip at 
the last minute for health reasons. ``We cannot just come with a team 
that is a world champion without including its stars,'' Verbeke told 
reporters. ``Otherwise we just won't come. If FIFA does not impose 
a decision, our participation will be compromised.'' National teams 
from Brazil, France, the United States, Bolivia, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, 
Egypt and the winner of the Oceania Nations Cup, to be decided on 
Sunday between New Zealand and Australia, will take part in the Confederations 
Cup.
