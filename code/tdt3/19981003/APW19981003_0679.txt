Former US President Jimmy Carter on Saturday called on Spain to ``help 
correct the mistake that is US policy towards Cuba'' by investing 
in the Caribbean island, news reports said. During a lecture delivered 
in Spanish in this northern city, Carter said ``Via investment, visits, 
inspiration and example we should find a way to alleviate the suffering 
of the Cuban people and help them find a route towards liberty and 
democracy,'' the private news agency Europa Press reported. Spanish 
companies, particularly in the tourist industry, are among the most 
enthusiastic explorers of investment opportunities in the Caribbean 
island. Carter has criticized U.S. restrictions on economic relations 
with Cuba before, on the grounds that they allow Cuban leader Fidel 
Castro to portray himself as a martyr. During his talk, given on invitation 
of a local savings bank and entitled ``family values and the virtue 
of saving,'' Carter also emphasized the cultural links between Spain 
and its former colonies in Latin America that should aid economic 
cooperation, the agency reported. The former president also said that 
Spain's remarkably smooth transition to democracy after dictator Gen. 
Francisco Franco died in 1975 had partially inspired him to set up 
the democracy-promoting Carter Center in 1982. Carter was next week 
due to visit several more cities around Spain during a private vacation 
with his family, Europa Press said.
