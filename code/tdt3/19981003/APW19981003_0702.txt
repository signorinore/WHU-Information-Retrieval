Roddy McDowall, a child actor in Britain who became a film star in 
``How Green Was My Valley'' and ``Lassie Come Home'' and as an adult 
proved a versatile performer in theater, television and films that 
included ``The Planet of the Apes,'' died Saturday. He was 70 and 
had been diagnosed in April of cancer. McDowall died at his home in 
the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles, said Dennis Osborne, 
a friend who said he had cared for the actor in his final months. 
``It was very peaceful,'' Osborne said. ``It was just as he wanted 
it. It was exactly the way he planned.'' After appearing in several 
British films, McDowall at 11 was among the children evacuated to 
the United States during the German bombardment. Hollywood producers 
were impressed with his innocent face and precise diction, and he 
was first cast in Fritz Lang's ``Man Hunt.'' The boy emerged as a 
star in John Ford's saga of Welsh coal miners, ``How Green Was My 
Valley.'' ``The youngster may prove this studio's boy counterpart 
to Shirley Temple,'' Variety magazine said in a 1941 review. ``I can't 
say I was unhappy as a child actor in films, because I wasn't,'' he 
said in a 1963 interview. ``I had a particularly wonderful time. The 
only trouble was that by the time I got to be 17 or 18, Hollywood 
was still thinking of me in terms of what I had delivered at the age 
of 11. ``They said I couldn't play anything but an English boy. I 
knew I could. So I went to New York and started to study, because 
I knew I had to learn a lot about myself as an actor; you can't act 
the same as you did as a child. ``Fortunately, I happened to go east 
at a time when live television was centered in New York. For six years 
I played every kind of role, from Mexican-Americans to Midwestern 
Americans. I did different roles on the stage: a Chicago boy in `Compulsion' 
and a southerner in `No Time for Sergeants.' '' That ability to move 
into almost any role led him to be cast as a Roman emperor in ``Cleopatra,'' 
a Bible figure in ``The Greatest Story Ever Told'' and as Cornelius 
in ``The Planet of the Apes'' and sequels. He was born Roderick Andrew 
Anthony Jude McDowall on Sept. 17, 1928, in London. His father was 
Scottish, his mother Irish. Educated at St. Joseph's school, he made 
his film debut at 8 in ``Murder in the Family.'' He came to the United 
States after the Blitz, the German bombardment of London, began in 
1940. Among his other films: ``Inside Daisy Clover,'' ``Midas Run,'' 
``Five Card Stud,'' ``Bedknobs and Broomsticks,'' ``The Life and Times 
of Judge Roy Bean,'' ``The Poseidon Adventure,'' ``Funny Lady,'' ``Only 
the Lonely.'' No services were planned. He was survived by his sister, 
Virginia McDowall of Los Angeles, Osborne said.
