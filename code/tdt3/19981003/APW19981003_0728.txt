And now for something completely different: In German. Two previously 
unaired TV programs made by the Monty Python team for German TV have 
been found in a cellar after nearly 30 years, The Sunday Times reported. 
The newspaper said that Python member Terry Jones discovered the two, 
45 minute episodes, entitled Fliegender Zirkus, as he was carrying 
out a random audit of his cellar. The newspaper did not report when 
the films were found or for which German TV station they were made 
for, but said that the episodes were being released on video this 
week. The Sunday Times said that the sketches were recorded in 1971, 
when the Monty Python team were offered work in Munich, southern Germany, 
to experiment with Ango-German comedy. The scripts were written in 
English and translated into German for the comedians to read out. 
The sketches appeared as bizarre - and sometimes as tasteless - as 
the ones Monty Python made in English. According to the newspaper, 
this was the Monty Python's take on the great German painter, Albrecht 
Durer. ``Born 1471 in Nuremberg, died 1528 somewhere else, famous 
throughout Europe for his paintings, his engravings, and his car hire 
business.'' There was also a sketch with John Cleese playing a Hitlerian 
game show host. He also played the part of a Robin Hood terrorizing 
woodland animals, The Sunday Times said. ``There was a sketch about 
Bavarian waiters, which caused some problems when the luckless guest 
was apparently thrown out of the window to his death. The Germans 
thought we were going a bit too far with that one,'' the newspaper 
quoted Ian MacNaughton, the show's producer, as saying. The six members 
of Monty Python: John Cleese, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, 
Terry Gilliam and Graham Chapman, recorded 44 comedy programs in English 
for the British Broadcasting Corp. between 1969 and 1974.
