Serbian authorities, in their latest move to head off NATO missiles 
and bombs, installed an interim government in Kosovo on Saturday that 
they said was aimed at restoring conditions in the rebellious province 
to normal. Zoran Andjelkovic, the man appointed by the Serbian Parliament 
to head the 18-member Interim Executive Council, told the new members 
at their first session in the Kosovo Parliament building: ``We have 
to defeat the terrorists and work for the benefit of all our citizens.'' 
Meanwhile, the Yugoslav air defense has been placed on the highest 
state of alert to counter possible NATO airstrikes, said a Yugoslav 
army commander who spoke Saturday on condition of anonymity. Constituting 
the new council, moribund since 1989, was part of a last-ditch effort 
to show Serbs intend to end the conflict and came just two days before 
a report by United Nations chief Kofi Annan on whether Belgrade is 
complying with demands to halt its assault on ethnic Albanians. If 
not, Washington has indicated NATO airstrikes will happen within two 
weeks. Late Friday, the Yugoslav government called a special session 
of the federal parliament for Monday to discuss how to ``protect the 
international position and state interests'' of the country. Like
