If the final round of qualifying is indicative of how competitive 
the inaugural Texaco Grand Prix will be, the drivers will be nothing 
less than ace forecasters. Canadian Greg Moore barely beat Scotsman 
Dario Franchitti on Saturday in a dramatic battle for the pole position. 
The Canadian will start first Sunday on the 2.457-kilometer (1.527-mile), 
10-turn temporary street circuit circling the downtown George R. Brown 
Convention Center. Moore, assessed an eight-minute penalty for an 
infraction Friday, won the pole while idle in the pits at the end 
of the 30-minute qualifying session. His lap of 59.508 seconds was 
good enough for his fourth pole of the season and CART Indy-car FedEx 
Series career. Franchitti, who will start from the front row for the 
seventh time in his last nine races, wound up second just 22 hundredths 
of a seconds behind. ``I got in my fast lap pretty early, but I didn't 
think it would be enough,'' Moore said. ``Because I had the penalty 
(for causing a red flag in Friday's time trials with a spinout), at 
the end, I knew I had only another lap or two. ``I had a real good 
one going and I swung out my rear end a little bit and that was it. 
Dario ran two really good laps at the end and I thought I was going 
to lose it.'' Franchitti was the only one close to Moore. Former CART 
champion Jimmy Vasser of the United States was third with a lap of 
59.720, followed by Canadian Paul Tracy at 59.735. The top 15 drivers 
on the 28-car grid were separated by less than a second, with the 
top 26 within 2 seconds of the pole winner. ``I think it's going to 
be a war on Sunday,'' Franchitti said with a grin. ``I think it's 
going to be a fun day for us and for the fans.'' One reason for the 
optimism is that the new track, although short and winding, is wider 
than the average street circuit, offering at least some hope of passing. 
``I think there's going to be a couple of passing zones,'' Vasser 
said. Franchitti, sitting alongside, leaned toward Vasser and jokingly 
asked, ``What places are those?'' ``I'll show you tomorrow,'' Vasser 
replied. Moore shrugged when asked about passing on the new track, 
saying. ``It's difficult to tell, really,'' he said. ``In practice 
and qualifying, you're trying to stay away from everybody, to get 
a clear track. ``Sunday, in the warmup, is going to be the first chance 
to see where you're going to be able to pass somebody. But I think 
there's at least one good place.'' There should be plenty of motivation 
for the drivers to take a risk on Sunday, with six of the starters 
embroiled in a tight battle for second place in the series and the 
dlrs 500,000 payoff that goes with it. ``It's a risk-versus-reward 
thing,'' Vasser said, indicating that a one-stop strategy could be 
in the offing. The championship has already been wrapped up by Italy's 
Alex Zanardi. His teammate, Vasser is in second place, with Mexican 
Adrian Fernandez, Franchitti, Moore, and Americans Michael Andretti 
and Scott Pruett within 28 points. ``Taking second place would be 
awfully important to me, but it's important to Dario and Jimmy and 
those other guys, too,'' Moore said. ``I think you're going to see 
an exciting race tomorrow.'' Zanardi, who crashed into a tire wall 
in qualifying on Friday, did it again Saturday, hitting in almost 
the same spot midway through the session. His fast lap stood up for 
eighth place. ``I had the same problem as I did yesterday with the 
gearbox,'' the frustrated Italian said. ``When I downshift, it locks 
up on me. I'm unhappy because there was more left in the car. It was 
a bad deal.'' Another frustrated driver was three-time champion Bobby 
Rahal, who started the day on the provisional pole and fell all the 
way to ninth. ``We have a better car than we showed,'' Rahal said. 
``I had a couple of good laps going and traffic really hurt us. The 
race will not go to the fastest driver Sunday. It will go to the smartest 
driver. ``This track is a lot like Toronto, with the long straights. 
It will be hard on the tires and brakes. Even in qualifying you saw 
a lot of guys slide into the runoff areas. I expect more of that in 
the race.''
