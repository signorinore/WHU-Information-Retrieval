The house Judiciary committee will meet on Monday to vote on beginning 
a formal impeachment inquiry. It plans to ask Ken Starr whether he 
has found evidence of impeachable offences beyond the president's 
affair with Lewinsky. Starr has investigated a number of controversies 
including Whitewater, the firing of the White House travel office 
staff and the presence of FBI files in the White House. House speaker 
Newt Gingrich says now is the time to be thorough and nonpartisan. 
This next week is a vote of conscience. We will not use the whip organization 
on the republican side. This is something that each member should 
approach as an American based on their oath to uphold the constitution 
as their oath of office. And I would hope that's the way to be dealt 
with next week, so I hope it wouldn't be democrats or republicans, 
it would be Americans. Starr has alleged 11 possible impeachable offenses 
all related to the president's affair with Lewinsky.
