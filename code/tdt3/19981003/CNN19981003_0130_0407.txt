Federal officials are leaning towards bringing new charges against 
bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph. Sources say forensic tests show 
that nails and other materials taken from Rudolph's storage shed in 
North Carolina are identical to components discovered in bomb fragments 
found at the scene of the attacks at Atlanta's centennial park. He 
already is wanted for last January's explosion at a Birmingham, Alabama, 
women's clinic. Some justice department officials are said to be against 
charging him in the Atlanta bombing right now. They say the move would 
force the agency to reveal evidence best kept secret.
