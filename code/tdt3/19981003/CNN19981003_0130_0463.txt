The Pentagon expects to spend millions next year keeping retired servicemen 
supplied with Viagra. Pentagon officials say 6 million doses of Viagra 
could be needed, even if prescriptions are limited, to men with diagnosed 
impotence. The cost, $50 million, is about as much as 45 tomahawk 
cruise missiles. The Pentagon provides health care to about 1.2 million 
troops and 5 million dependents and retirees.
