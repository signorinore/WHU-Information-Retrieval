I'm meteorologist rose stabler in the CNN weather center with your 
"Headline News" forecast. Isolated rain and snow in the northwest 
for Saturday morning. Heavier rainfall from northern Louisiana into 
the Great Lakes due to an area of low pressure and also a trough of 
low pressure. As we look into Sunday morning and Saturday evening, 
not much changes. The rain continues in lower Mississippi valley into 
the northeast and scattered snow showers along with rain over the 
northern Rockies. Nice weather, however, throughout the weekend over 
the southern Rockies and west Texas. High temperatures show becoming 
a fall -- or that fall is here, actually. Highs on Saturday generally 
in the 40s, 50s and 60s over the northern half of the country. It's 
going to be hot in Texas with highs in the 90s. Your extended forecast

way to the Texas/Louisiana coastline. Cooler temperatures over the 
northern half of the country throughout the extended forecast period. 
The strong thunderstorms push southward from the dakotas into Iowa,

push northward from Arkansas into the Great Lakes where we could see 
an icy mix of rain and snow.
