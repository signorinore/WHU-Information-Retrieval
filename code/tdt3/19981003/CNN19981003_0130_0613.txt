There was a high-speed chase through the streets of suburban Los Angeles 
Friday after police say a man stole a 7-up tractor-trailer from a 
supermarket. The chase included one collision and lasted an hour and 
a half. The truck later stopped in a residential neighborhood and 
the suspect was arrested after he was pulled from a tree.
