There's new ammunition in the fight against E. Coli. Doctors say they 
may have discovered a drug strong enough to battle the deadly bacteria 
and win. Linda ciampa reports. Mary Beth and Anna Dooley are strong 
and healthy today. But a few months ago, they were very sick, hospitalized 
with severe E. Coli infections. They were so sick they could not even 
hold down sips of water. No food whatsoever. The Dooley girls recovered. 
And they helped doctors learn more about a new experimental drug that 
may be able to do what no other drug has yet accomplished -- fight 
the deadly E. Coli bacteria. The girls were part of a clinical trial 
that's testing a new drug called synsorb pk. It acts like a toxin 
sponge. The compound is taken by the patient, it goes straight to 
the gut because it can't go anywhere else. It's an insoluble product, 
and once in the gut, it specifically reacts with the toxins produced 
by E. Coli, inactivates the toxins, which is then excreted out of 
the body as waste. Researchers say the new drug may be able to prevent 
E. Coli from advancing to its most dangerous stage. And if the infection 
does reach that stage, the new drug may still be able to help by preventing 
life-threatening complications. Dr. Barry warshaw treated the Dooley 
girls. This is a very logical treatment that has a lot of promise, 
and so I am excited about it. There have been other treatments tried, 
specific treatments tried over the years. And so far none have panned 
out. The dooleys don't know if the new drug helped in the girls' recoveries. 
They may have gotten placebos. And they don't know how the girls contracted 
the bacteria. But the dooleys say they feel good knowing if final 
testing of synsorb pk goes as planned, other kids and adults sickened 
by E. Coli could have a new drug by the end of next year. Linda ciampa, 
CNN, Atlanta.
