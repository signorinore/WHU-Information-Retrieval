1,100 Boeing workers got 60-day layoff notices Friday. Most of them 
are white-collar workers in the puget sound area in Washington. Boeing 
says it's the first step in a move to cut 28,000 jobs by the end of 
the year. Boeing hopes to find jobs for the laid-off workers within 
the company before December 4th.
