The similarities between Exxon's cartoon Tiger and Tony the Tiger 
has Kellogg's in an uproar. Kellogg's wants a judge to stop Exxon 
from using its cat. Tony Guida reports. Grrrreat! Tony the Tiger has 
been roaring his pitch for Kellogg's frosted flakes since Eisenhower 
was president. But just before the turbulent 1960s arrived, so did 
another Tiger. We never knew his name, but he works for Exxon, advising 
drivers to "put a Tiger in your tank." No problem. There's room for 
more than one Tiger in the advertising jungle. Or at least there was 
until a few years ago, when Exxon's cat started hawking wild Tiger 
soft drinks and Bengal coffee at its Tiger Mart gas station stores. 
Tony roared foul, claiming he should be the only Tiger allowed to 
hawk food products. Kellogg sued, lost and is now appealing. Telling 
CNN -- Exxon purrs "no way, the two tigers look nothing alike." Well 
you know there are a lot of tigers out there. Uniroyal has one. Disney 
has a Tiger. In fact, tigers are the second-most popular mascot for 
sports teams in America. So there's room for a lot of tigers out there. 
One veteran ad man agreed, but said he's not surprised by this cat 
fight. You have to understand how seriously people take their logos. 
I worked on a campaign for psa airlines, and the advertising manager 
would salute the logo as he passed it -- salute it! I mean, but not 
as a joke. Tony the Tiger, I guess, is a great symbol. And I don't 
know, the Exxon Tiger is also a great symbol. I never put the two 
of them together. In dismissing the case, the first judge ruled it 
didn't matter whether Exxon's Tiger was on a gas tank or a drink and 
that Kellogg had waited too long to stake a claim on tigers. Kellogg's 
is hoping the next judge will see things differently. Tony Guida,
