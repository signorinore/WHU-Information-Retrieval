A rainy night for the American league playoffs details next in Headline 
Sports. It was the merger of the two largest railroads in America. 
And it touched everyone... to unite the atlantic and the pacific... 
for when the last Spike was driven into the last tie... America was 
officially open for business. The east and west have come together... 
and now... it's happening again. A new and critical link has been 
forged. A worldwide network... two of the largest networks on earth 
have just become one. With capacity so vast, it can carry all the 
data traffic of all the other carriers combined to more places around 
the world than any other network. Introducing MCI Worldcom. Now the 
world is officially open for business.
