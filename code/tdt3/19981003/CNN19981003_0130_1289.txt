Duane Walker, "Headline Sports." First stop in the majors where they're 
finally playing baseball. The Yankees and rangers were involved in 
a three-hour rain delay. In the agent inning the Yankees have a 4-0 
lead. In a related story, one day after being diagnosed with colon 
cancer, Yankees outfielder Darryl Strawberry made his first public 
appearance. When you reach this point where get to the playoffs. You're 
not able to be part of it because of an illness. And but -- like I 
said, I really have no control over it. And all I can do is, you know, 
try to be strong and do the best that I can. Earlier, the Cleveland 
Indians bolted to a 2-1 series lead over Boston after a 4-3 victory. 
All four of the tribe's runs came off homers. Manny Ramirez led the 
charge with a pair. Jim thome and Kenny Lofton provided the others. 
Charles nagy hurled eight solid innings for Cleveland. The San Diego 
padres and Houston astros will meet in game three of their national 
league series Saturday. Manager Bruce bochy has changed his pitching 
rotation. Game one starter Kevin brown will get the nod and start 
in game three Saturday night. The Florida Marlins have found a new 
manager to replace Jim leyland. It will be vice president of player 
development, John boyles.
