The London tabloid "the mirror" is admitting a story about actors 
Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson was totally false. The couple sued 
the paper for libel after it ran a story claiming their marriage is 
a sham. Neeson and Richardson were awarded $85,000 Friday. They're 
donating the money to charity.
