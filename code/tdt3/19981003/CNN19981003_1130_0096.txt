the tough economic times facing american farmers is is the topic of 
president clinton's radio address today. he warns congress that the 
money available isn't enough to meet the worst farming crisis in decades. 
the senate is scheduled to act on it monday. as we end the near of 
the legislative session and finish our work on the budget, we have 
a real opportunity to protect our farmers. the strict budget rules 
permit strict measures for emergencies. and make no mistake, this 
is a real emergency. as harmful as a hurricane, a flood or a riot. 
i call on congress not to leave town before they've sent me a comprehensive 
plan that protects farmers by strengthening the safety net at this 
very difficult time.
