with the threat of nato air strikes looming, serbian authorities are 
scrambling to show they're complying with u.n. orders to withdraw 
troops from the troubled kosovo province. jamie mcintyre reports on 
preparations for a possible military confrontation. nato ambassadors 
meet wednesday to approve plans for air strikes designed to compel 
yugoslav president slobodan milosevic to end his crackdown on albanian 
separatists in kosovo. this weekend, the u.s. aircraft carrier "eisenhower" 
will put to sea from the eastern mediterranean port of rhodes, greece. 
the carrier, with its 50 strike aircraft and cruise missile equipped 
escort ships, will then be within a day's striking distance of yugoslavia. 
combined with land-based planes in italy, nato has a formidable air 
armada. but can it force compliance from president milosevic? we have 
nato working. we have the u.n. resolution. i believe that our allies 
in europe are with us, and i think that we all understand and we hope 
he got the message. with the snows of winter just weeks away, with 
an estimated 50,000 ethnic albanian refugees forced to live in the 
hills, the u.s. insists milosevic has very little time. to avert air 
strikes, he must comply with all the demands of last month's u.n. 
resolution. this is not an ad hoc approach he can take and pick and 
choose ala carte. he must accept the entire set of demands, otherwise 
he will face the use of force. the united states is supposed to tell 
nato which planes it will contribute to the strike force by monday. 
sources say the u.s. is considering adding two lethal warplanes to 
the mix -- radar-evading f-117 stealth fighters and b-52 bombers, 
outfitted with air-launched cruise missiles with bigger warheads than 
the ship-launched version. nato continues to hope that its repeated 
threats of force will result in a diplomatic solution. but if it does 
not, sources say the first salvo of cruise missiles could be headed 
to yugoslavia in a week or less. jamie mcintyre, cnn, the pentagon.
