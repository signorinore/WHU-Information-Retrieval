researchers at m.i.t. have come up with a way to help children turn 
sounds into music. ann kellan has the story in this edition of "tech 
trends." a familiar sight -- children singing. it's how many kids 
get their first taste of music before they're old enough to play the 
piano or the violin. but if you are tired of the same old song welcome 
to the computer age. some researchers at the m.i.t. media lab are 
trying to shake up the way kids make music. there's nothing simpler 
than rattles. now they're digital. this is something light and simple 
for kids to play with. now, they don't have to understand what's going 
on in there, just pick it up and make sound. what is going on in there, 
anyway? it's going through the shaking? yeah, the shaking goes through 
a wire and to a digitizer, which is underneath, and goes into the 
computer. the rattles are high tech and fun for all ages. but a musical 
playpen? according to him, it's all about good vibrations, sensors 
in the balls pick up movement. as you swim around, like swimming in 
water, your movement will be interpreted by computer, and that will 
create the music that you're hearing right now, for example. remember 
how much fun it is to squish jell-o between your fingers? well, these 
m.i.t. researchers have come up with a way to do it that not only 
won't get kids in trouble -- now squeezing makes music. they're called 
squeezables. we tried many different kinds of materials, like foam 
and soft plastic, and we reached the conclusion that jell-o is the 
most responsive one. just how does jell-o make music? in each ball, 
we have the sensor, which is a false pressure sensor. it gives you 
continuous control. when i squeeze the jell-o, the jell-o squeezes 
the pressure sensors. m.i.t. researchers say it will be at least a 
year before any of these children will be able to rock, rattle or 
roll with the digital toys. in the meantime, most kids find a way 
to have a good time making music. ann kellan, cnn, cambridge, massachusetts.
