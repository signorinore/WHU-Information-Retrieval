a number of airlines this year decided to join forces to boost business. 
but to many travelers, the effects remain up in the air. stephanie 
oswald reports in this edition of "working ahead." it's an all-star 
draft with all the major players. continental and northwest were the 
first to team up in january. then u.s. airways joined forces with 
american airlines. and delta linked up with united. but experts predict 
the flying public won't be cheering. unique thing about this relationship 
is there's probably no winning for the consumers. no real cost savings 
in all of these alliances, but all the benefits are going toward these 
big fancy frequent-flyer programs. delta and united kicked off team 
first. travelers flying dom routes on united can now choose to credit 
them to a frequent-flyer account or vice versa. passengers who belong 
to both programs will need to decide which account to credit with 
the miles. under current rules, delta and united are not allowing 
miles to be pooled for reward ticket redemption. but flyers can use 
miles from both accounts to get a free ticket. for example, a passenger 
can combine 11,000 american miles with 14,000 u.s. airway miles to 
receive a ticket to fly american. or the same miles can be used to 
fly on a u.s. airways jet. you must use a minimum of 1,000 miles from 
each account. but skeptics say having more options won't make a difference, 
because the airports are packed already, making it tough to secure 
a free flight in any case. stephanie oswald, cnn, atlanta.
