jerome jurenovich, "headline sports." the indians rained home runs 
on the red sox while it just plain rabed on the yankees and rangers 
on friday. after a 3 hour and 16 minute rain delie, new york completed 
a three-game sweep of texas by holding the best hitting team in the 
american league to just one run in 27 innings. before the wet stuff 
fell, rookie sensation shane spencer went deep again, as did paul 
o'neill in the 4-zip shutout. as i sit here right now, there's probably 
two things that have really surprised me. number one is that we only 
scored one run in three ball games. and the second -- second of all, 
is that we only gave them whatever two, three and four adds up to 
be. i know we have good pitching, good starting pitching, and we've 
all it all year. to hold that ball club to one run in three games 
is amazing me. the yankees await the winner of the indians and red 
sox game. jim thome almost took out the camerawoman in center. while 
manny ramirez drilled a pair, the second turned out to be the game 
winner off dennis eckersley as the red sox scored three in the ninth 
before cleveland held on to win. it didn't surprise me the way manny 
hit the ball tonight. the way manny hit the ball in the series. he's 
playing up to his potential. in all aspects of his game. not just 
9 bat. the two national series games resume today. the padres will 
go with kevin brown against houston's mime hampton.
