"Headline News." I'm Kate snow. Leaders of the world's largest economies 
are gathered in Washington today. Finance ministers from the G-7 nations 
are trying to put the brakes on a financial crisis before it becomes 
a global depression. More than a quarter of the world is in recession 
including Japan. U.S. treasury secretary Robert Rubin says it's crucial 
for Japan to reform its banking system and stimulate growth. CNN's 
Bill dorman is covering the talks in Washington and says Japan seems 
to have a broader purpose. The Japanese have brought a proposal for 
an additional $30 billion package for Asian nations hit hardest by 
the continuing crisis. The United States have been cautiously supportive 
of that. But U.S. officials are also quick to point out that Japan 
needs to focus on its own economic problems so it can help stabilize 
other parts of Asia. The United States is proposing making a more 
expensive line of credit to be available for economies which are not 
slipped into deep recession but which are at risk. The meeting is 
also shoring up support for President Clinton's plan to make it easier 
for the international monetary fund to grant emergency loans to countries 
in financial turmoil.
