President Clinton is urging Congress to remain in session until it 
comes up with an improved Bill to help cash-strapped U.S. farmers 
and ranchers. The house approved a 4.2 billion bailout package yesterday. 
Mr. Clinton proposed his own relief package worth $7.5 billion. He 
stressed the importance of the extra money in his weekly radio address. 
As we near the end of the legislative session and finish our work 
on the budget, we have a real opportunity to protect our farmers. 
The strict budget rules permit special measures for one-time emergencies. 
And make no mistake, for America's farm families this is a real emergency, 
as harmful as a hurricane, a flood or riot. I call on Congress not 
to leave town before they've sent me a comprehensive plan that protects 
farmers by strengthening the safety net at this very difficult time.
