The GOP is rebuking President Clinton over his plans for the budget 
surplus. In today's weekly GOP radio address senator Phil Gramm said 
the president wants to squander $20 billion of the projected $70 billion 
surplus on government programs rather than republican-proposed tax 
cuts. The president is opposed to a tax Bill to give tax relief to 
farmers, seniors and self-employed because he says it would lower 
the budget surplus by $6.6 billion. But what you probably don't know, 
and you certainly aren't going to hear it from the president, is that 
while he opposes using $6.6 billion of the surplus next year for a 
tax cut, he is at the very moment pressuring Congress to spend $20 
billion on that same surplus on government programs. The senator wasn't 
the only one speaking out against President Clinton. Protesters gathered 
outside the White House today carrying signs reading "fire the liar" 
and "jail the Clintons."
