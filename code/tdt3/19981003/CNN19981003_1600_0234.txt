The public is busy digesting details from 4,600 pages of additional 
documents from Ken Starr's investigation that were released yesterday. 
Testimony from Mr. Clinton's friend Vernon Jordan and presidential 
secretary Betty Currie is included in the latest release. The documents 
also contain transcripts of the conversations with Monica Lewinsky 
that Linda Tripp secretly recorded. Republicans say the scandal is 
a mess of the president's own making. In its zeal to prop up its allegations 
against the president, the office of the independent counsel, in its 
referral to the House of Representatives, intentionally omitted direct, 
exculpatory testimony, paraphrased unambiguous statements to obscure 
their plain meaning and systematically resolved conflicting testimony 
in its favor. Let's just take our time. This is serious stuff. This 
is about the kind of leaders we want, the kind of country we want, 
the fabric of our society, things about telling the truth in a court 
of law, potential obstruction of justice. It's going to take some 
time. I don't want this to drag on. I didn't want this to happen, 
but the fact is, it did happen. We can't sweep it away. We've got 
to proceed in a directed way, and at the end of the day we'll come 
up with judgments.
