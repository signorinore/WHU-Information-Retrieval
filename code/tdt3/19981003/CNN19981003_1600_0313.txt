The White House has gotten some fresh fodder with the release of more 
of the documents. Wolf Blitzer reports the independent counsel is 
the target. The White House is on the offensive. Attacking Ken Starr's 
allegations as one-sided, salacious and not grounds for impeachment, 
saying the independent counsel -- Intentionally omitted direct exculpatory 
testimony, paraphrased unambiguous statements to obscure their plain 
meaning and systematically resolved conflicting testimony in its favor. 
The White House's new damage control man, Gregory Craig, cited testimony 
he says weakens Starr's case against the president. On charges of 
obstruction of justice, he pointed to sworn statements from Monica 
Lewinsky, the president's private secretary, Betty Currie, and his 
friend Vernon Jordan. All, he says, deny Mr. Clinton came up with 
the idea of trying to silence Lewinsky by getting her a job in New 
York. If the president intended to secure Ms. Lewinsky's silence in 
exchange for a job, it was clearly in his power to do so and to grant 
her precisely what she wanted. But the oic simply ignores the plain 
fact that he did not, because that fact thoroughly eviscerates the 
independent counsel's job-for-silence theory. On those gifts the president 
gave to Lewinsky that were later returned to Currie, one of Starr's 
claims of obstruction of justice, the White House pointed to testimony 
from Currie denying the president ever asked her to collect those 
gifts. None of these three statements is directly quoted in the Starr 
referral. The other main line of attack from the White House -- it 
was Linda Tripp who aided Starr by maneuvering to expand his investigation, 
specifically by manipulating Lewinsky. Beyond all this, the White 
House released a 30-page memorandum sent to the house Judiciary committee 
making the case against impeachment. Starr issued his own statement, 
calling the White House reaction "disingenuous," insisting his report 
was thorough and balanced. White House aides concede the republican 
majority in Congress is unlikely to be swayed by their arguments. 
They're hoping democrats and the American public will. Wolf Blitzer, 
CNN, the White House.
