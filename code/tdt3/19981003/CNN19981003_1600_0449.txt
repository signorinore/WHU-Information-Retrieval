Violent weather in northern Texas has damaged 36 homes and injured 
several people. Hardest hit was the town of Graham, 105 miles west 
of Dallas. A tornado there last night damaged homes and flipped over 
two cattle trucks. Flights in and out of the Dallas-FT. Worth international 
airport were canceled temporarily and a control tower was briefly 
evacuated because of high winds.
