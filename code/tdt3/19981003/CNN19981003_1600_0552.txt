A 25-mile oil slick in the gulf of Mexico appears to be moving away 
from shore, sparing sensitive wildlife. The oil sprang from a leaking 
underwater pipeline that connects to a bp oil platform 100 miles southeast 
of New Orleans. The pipeline has been shut down. Just what caused 
a 10-mile slick near San Francisco is still a mystery. The spill is 
near one of the most productive seabird breeding grounds in the pacific. 
So far, 35 birds have been found dead. Another 40 were taken to a 
wildlife center.
