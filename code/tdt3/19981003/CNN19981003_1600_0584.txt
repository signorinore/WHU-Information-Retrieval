Los Angeles county has found a new way to get welfare recipients back 
to work. It involves raising their self-esteem. Charles Feldman reports. 
When people work and earn what they bring to their families, everybody 
benefits from that. It's a win/win situation. If a recent report is 
true, the people in this special class in Los Angeles county are more 
likely to get off welfare and get on a payroll than ever before. They 
are part of a large-scale, welfare-to-work initiative called "gain," 
designed to boast self esteem and give them the practical tools needed 
to find jobs. We used to invest primarily in education and vocational 
training as a prerequisite to getting a person a job. We found that 
that was not productive. It was very expensive and, frankly, did not 
produce the kind of outcomes that we needed to see. The basic philosophy 
of the "gain" program is, get a job, any job first, and then acquire 
the skills and education to advance. "Gain" pays particular attention 
to pumping up self-esteem. The group experience apparently helps. 
Just that one-day experience sometimes can help people realize, "hey, 
I'm a human being like everyone else. And other people have gone through 
this, and they've made it work for themselves. And I can do it, too." 
a recent report by a nonprofit research firm studying social programs 
found the L.A. county initiative very successful. Besides the one-day 
orientation class, participants attend workshops that teach them how 
to develop job-seeking skills. When you leave, you feel different. 
You know, you feel different from when you came in here at 8:00 in 
the morning. Your self-esteem is up. You're like, "oh, I can do everything." 
They never let you give up. They're constantly behind you, telling 
you, "keep going and do it." They bring out the best in you to actually 
go out and get a job. Although some people on welfare must attend 
the "gain" program, while others volunteer, officials here say they 
see little difference in the outcome. Charles Feldman, CNN, Los Angeles.
