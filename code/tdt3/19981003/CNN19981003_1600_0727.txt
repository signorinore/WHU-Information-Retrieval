The Pentagon says it will spend millions of dollars next year keeping 
retired servicemen supplied with Viagra. Pentagon officials say $6 
million doses of Viagra could be needed even if prescriptions are 
limited to men with diagnosed impotence. The $50 million cost is about 
as much as 45 tomahawk cruise missiles. The Pentagon provides health 
care to 1.2 million troops and 5 million dependents and retirees.
