Investors took a 244-point bite out of the Dow this week as Wall Street 
kicked off the fourth quarter. David Daniel has a review in "business 
this week." Alan Greenspan and the federal reserve did what most people 
expected this week -- cutting short-term interest rates. But the quarter-point 
cut decided upon by the fed's open market committee wasn't enough 
for Wall Street. Traders had been hoping for a half-point drop, and 
immediately, the market dropped, as the Dow fell the remainder of 
that day and the following two sessions as well. Prospective homebuyers 
found a silver lining in the market's troubles -- shaken investors 
sought refuge in the bond market and lower treasury bond yields mean 
lower home financing costs. 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to their 
lowest level since tracking began 13 years ago. Not all the week's 
home front news was good, however. The commerce department announced 
new home sales fell 4.4% in August, well below estimates, with sales 
in the south hit particularly hard. And despite lower interest rates, 
the construction boom appears to be flattening out. The commerce department 
said this week, construction spending inched up 0.1% in August. The 
same as in July, but far slower than June's pace. Even the positive 
trend at the pump slid back a bit this week. The lundberg survey says 
the average price of a gallon of gasoline rose more than a penny over 
the past two weeks to nearly $1.09. still, gas prices for the year 
are down about 25 cents a gallon. That's "business this week." David 
Daniel, "Headline News."
