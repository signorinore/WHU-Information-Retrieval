Matt Yallof, "Headline Sports." It's old-fashioned, smash-mouth, college 
football in the rain. Number one Ohio state defeated seventh ranked 
Penn state 28-9 in Columbus. A complete beating -- offensive, defensive 
and special teams TDs for Ohio state. They improve to 4-0. The nittany 
lions fall to 3-1. Other early games involving top ten teams -- number 
three Tennessee at Auburn. UCLA hosting Washington state. Florida 
at Alabama. Florida state visiting Maryland. And Virginia at home 
against San Jose state.
