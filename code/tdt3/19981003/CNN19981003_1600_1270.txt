Baseball news -- Yankees outfielder Darryl Strawberry is in a New 
York hospital this afternoon, undergoing surgery to remove a malignant 
tumor from his colon. Because the cancer was found in the early stages, 
a full recovery is expected. Well, in what you could call an inspirational 
victory, the Yankees completed the sweep of Texas early Saturday morning. 
In a game delayed more than three hours due to rain, New York shut 
out the rangers, 4-0. Those dangerous Texas bats produced just one 
run in three games. Three more playoff games on tap today -- the Indians 
look to wrap up the best of five in Boston. Despite being down 2-1, 
red sox manager Jimmy Williams is going with Pete schourek instead 
of bringing Pedro Martinez back on three days' rest. Cleveland goes 
with bartolo colon. Chilly, damp conditions expected at Wrigley tonight, 
as the Atlanta Braves, leading the series 2-0, look to finish off 
the cubbies. Greg Maddux faces Rookie Kerry wood, who's battled back 
from a sore elbow. Sammy and company need some of their regular season 
magic to overcome the massive 0-2 hurdle. We went to the playoff, 
and we're here in the playoff. You probably say that it is one game, 
but you never know what can happen. We're probably going to come back 
and win three in a row. I'm feeling good. I've been throwing, as you 
know, for about three weeks here, and it felt good. Went to Arizona, 
faced some hitters. You know, I expect to go out and continue where 
I left off. Padres hoping Kevin brown picks up where he left off. 
After winning game one, he's back on three days' rest, as the padres 
look to go up 2-1 on Houston. The astros counter with lefty Mike Hampton.
