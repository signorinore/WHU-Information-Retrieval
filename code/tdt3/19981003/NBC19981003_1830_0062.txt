Good evening, everyone. We begin tonight with the economy and the 
continued threat of a global economic crisis. At the White House President 
Clinton met with his top economic advisers to hammer out some solutions. 
It all comes as representatives of governments gather in Washington 
looking for financial help. John Palmer is at the White House tonight. 
Good evening, dawn. There was a high sense of urgency in the White 
House and also at meeting places throughout Washington as the president 
and international financial people grappled with ways to he'd the 
economic problem. At the headquarters of the international monetary 
fund, representatives of the world's developing countries, many in 
dire economic straits, met with world bank officials and waited for 
word on how the United States and other wealthy countries can help. 
The day began with treasury secretary Robert Rubin arriving at the 
White House before breakfast, joining the president and his economic 
team to work on possible solutions. Last night, in Philadelphia, the 
president called on Congress to do its part by approving an $18 billion 
U.S. contribution to the international money fund used to bail out 
countries in economic distress. We have an obligation not only to 
others throughout the world, but to our own economy. 30% of this growth 
we've enjoyed has come from selling things to people overseas who 
had enough money to buy them and when get into trouble, eventually 
we will suffer from that. But there is plenty of evidence that U.S. 
business is already suffering, reflected by a sharp drop on Wall Street, 
lower exports and corporate earnings and higher unemployment. The 
Clinton administration sees Japan as the key to economic recovery 
in Asia. Today, Rubin welcomed a pledge from the Japanese foreign 
minister for $30 billion to help Asian economies recover, but he insisted 
that Japan also get its own financial house in order. Later Rubin 
and federal reserve chairman Alan Greenspan joined financial leaders 
of the world's seven industrial nations to discuss, among other things, 
a U.S. proposal to set up an international line of credit to help 
countries Ward off economic trouble before they have a full-blown 
crisis. It's not just Asian countries that has the United States worried, 
administration officials are very concerned about the economic and 
political confusion that continues elsewhere, especially in Russia. 
NBC's John Palmer dawn. At the White House tonight. Thank you, John.
