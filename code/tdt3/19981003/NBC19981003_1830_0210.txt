Russia's economic woes are so severe that inflation is up 67% in the 
past month. With so many people desperate for work, NBC's Dana Lewis 
reports, life for the ordinary Russian is now a daily struggle to 
survive. Unemployment lines are growing patience at a breaking point. 
Hundreds waited for hours to get into this Moscow job fair. Among 
them, Sonia kaznina, fired from a bank gone bankrupt. This situation 
not normal, normal for normal life. Sonia earned $150 a month, an 
above-average salary here. Now, she's applying for a job selling cosmetics, 
or as a secretary with this medical company. She's got a lot of competition. 
In Russia, disappointment, desperation, grows as fast as the long 
lines of the unemployed. Recruiting agencies say in the next two months, 
100,000 workers will lose their jobs. And that's just in Moscow's 
financial sector. United financial group deals in banking and brokerage. 
When the Russian stock market went from $200 million a day to just 
$1 million, the American manager was forced to lay off a third of 
his 170 employees. Others took 30% pay cuts. If you can manage your 
business through this kind of carnage, you can deal with just about 
anything. The government, mired in politics, isn't helping. It's printing 
money, scaring away foreign investors -- Russia's middle class hit 
the hardest. This growing middle class, thrown out, that was dedicated 
to the reform process, is a real blow. The same thing is happening 
to American workers. Michelle tien, who lost her job at a Russian 
consulting firm, is packing, her love affair with Russia over. It's 
extremely depressing. I think everybody thought that, okay, it might 
not be a smooth road to capitalism, but nobody expected to see a U-turn. 
The Americans can leave. However, the Russians aren't going anywhere. 
Dana Lewis, NBC news, Moscow.
