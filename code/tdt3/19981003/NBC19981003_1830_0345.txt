Now to the legal and political problems of President Clinton. On Monday, 
a congressional committee will begin the process of deciding whether 
he should face the possibility of removal from office. Here's NBC 
Suzanne Malveaux. President and Mrs. Clinton headed to camp David 
for some private time as the house Judiciary committee prepares for 
hearings into an impeachment inquiry. NBC news has confirmed that 
the republicans' lead investigator and his team are considering expanding 
the case to include other possibly impeachable offenses, in addition 
to Kenneth Starr's accusations of obstruction of justice and witness 
tampering. The committee may now also argue the president should be 
impeached for "making false statements under oath," a less serious 
but broader charge than perjury. The republicans seem to feel that 
maybe they are not going to have enough with what currently has been 
charged, so they are looking into expanding. Republicans are also 
discussing dropping the claim the president abused his power, when 
he cited executive privilege for not cooperating with Starr's investigation. 
And there is talk of naming Monica Lewinsky as a co-conspirator in 
the case, even though she already has full immunity. That would allow 
committee members to publicly show that they believe Lewinsky committed 
crimes, too. The final 4,600 pages of the Starr report, released yesterday, 
contained little new information, but they did add to perspective 
-- Monica Lewinsky's frustration and anger. Linda Tripp's efforts 
to draw Lewinsky out. Audio tapes of those conversations will be released 
next week. On Monday, each of the 37 members of the hoist Judiciary 
committee will have a chance to argue on what constitutes impeachable 
offenses, and then later the committee will vote on what members of 
Congress say what, not if, the inquiry proceeds. Suzanne Malveaux, 
NBC news, at the capitol.
