A complete text of the Starr report and President Clinton's videotaped 
grand jury testimony can be found on our web site, at MSNBC.com. A 
program note. Presidential impeachment prospects will be discussed 
in depth tomorrow on NBC's "meet the press." House Judiciary committee 
chairman Henry Hyde, ranking democratic committee member John Conyers 
and former presidential candidate Ross perot are among Tim russert's 
guests. When "NBC nightly news" continues in a moment -- hailing a 
baseball hero in his fight against cancer. And later -- in "focus," 
the amusement park accident a grand jury is calling murder. After 
his heart attack, Ed's doctor told him to exercise and take aspirin 
regularly. So he takes genuine Bayer aspirin to help prevent a second 
heart attack. But then there are those days when Ed's muscles ache 
and Ed could use extra strength Bayer. Nothing is stronger for pain.
