Big league baseball slugger Darryl Strawberry had surgery to remove 
a cancerous growth on his colon. No word on the outcome. More from 
NBC's Rick Davis. The Yankees locker room last night-- a mixture of 
joy and concern. They won the their division title. But their thoughts 
were of a player not there, Darryl Strawberry. We are all pulling 
for straw and hoping he pulls through and I'm sure he is going to 
do fine. This is for him. Darryl Strawberry has fought back from personal 
problems. Now he must fight colon cancer. I have a great deal of confidence. 
I'm not afraid. a survey done for the "today" show indicated 130,000 
Americans will get colon cancer. Slightly more than half will be women. 
About 10%, 13,000 will be under 50. The symptoms -- a change in bowel 
habits. Blood in the stool. Abdominal pain. If discovered early there 
is an over 90% cure rate. There are several screening methods. The 
most accurate is colonoscopy. A lighted scope checks for polyps or 
growths and is able to remove them. I didn't feel queasy or sore or 
anything. I was fine. For those with a family history of colon or 
other cancers, doctors recommend a search for three known cancer causing 
genes. But researchers emphasize most colon cancer is linked to behavior. 
A diet high in red meat and fat. High alcohol use. Smoking and lack 
of exercise. As Darryl Strawberry undergoes treatment, he already 
has H his own role model. High school friend Eric Davis of the Orioles, 
had colon cancer in 1997. I knew I had the determination and the drive 
to rehabilitate and do all the things necessary to get better. Eric 
Davis hit .327 this season, his highest average in 14 years in the 
major leagues. Quite a recovery model. Rick Davis, NBC news, New York.
