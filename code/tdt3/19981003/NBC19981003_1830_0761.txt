Now, to America's war on terrorism. A company in California is working 
on new ways to protect airplanes from bombs. Details from NBC's Dan 
Lothian. Ten yearsing a a bomb brought down an airplane. Flight 103 
over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 259 people on board and 11 on the 
ground. Now, after years of work, a Costa Mesa, California, company 
is manufacturing a design the federal aviation administration thinks 
will work. The bottom line is, if our container would have been in 
the Lockerbie incident, the aircraft would have survived, landed safely, 
and there would have been no damage to the aircraft and no injuries. 
Using an explosive force twice as powerful as the one that brought 
down Pan Am 103, the FAA put this new luggage container, known as 
ecos-3, to the test, and it passed. Not only did it withstand the 
explosion, but the 2,000-degree fire that occurred after. This new 
luggage container is a combination of layers of aluminum and glass 
held in place by a well-riveted frame, 80 pounds heavier than those 
now being used. Even though luggage is at times screened, and there 
are procedures to match bags with passengers before an airplane ever 
takes off, experts say, the system is incomplete, with big holes. 
Show me a picture I.D., please. Increased airport security, due to 
America's current war on terrorism, has also served to heighten awareness. 
Mary schiavo, former inspector general of the U.S. department of transportation, 
thinks the additional protection is crucial these days. We act on 
a system of trust. We trust that people will put only their luggage 
on the plane. We trust they won't do anything stupid. We trust them. 
And I think that trust level is probably not deserved anymore. The 
FAA is moving forward with this explosive-proof container, putting 
ten in service overseas -- one more step towards better protecting 
the traveling public. Dan Lothian, NBC news, Los Angeles.
