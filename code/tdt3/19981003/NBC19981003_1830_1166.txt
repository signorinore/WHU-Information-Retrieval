When we continue -- using the threat of violence to bring an end to 
violence. Ah, the good old days of supermarket shopping. Where nothing 
stood between you and your next meal. Nothing. But today, there are 
materials that help lock out harmful contaminants and reduce spoilage. 
Keeping us safe and the food we eat fresh. Plastics make it possible. 
So now, the rest is history. Another breakthrough... from the one 
hour labs of Lenscrafters. New featherwates plus lenses. They're lighter. 
they're thinner. They're more impact resistant. And now, they're twice 
as scratch resistant... compared to regular plastic lenses. Made in 
about an hour.
