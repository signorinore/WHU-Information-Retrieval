Now to Kosovo where tens of thousands of refugees and charges of atrocities 
committed by Serbian troops have led to threats of military action 
by NATO. They are now scrambling to diffuse the situation and avoid 
NATO air strikes. Ron Allen is in the region tonight. a day of relative 
quiet allows supplies to reach some of Kosovo's desperate refugees. 
Serb soldiers are trying to prove their cease-fire is real, taking 
down checkpoints, putting away some of their heavy weapons and showing 
the remains, Serbs who've been killed in the fighting. The question 
is whether Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic truly has halted 
his seven-month crackdown on ethnic Albanians or if he's pulling back 
just enough prevent NATO air strikes. He's a master at toying with 
the U.S. and its allies. He will pursue Serbian nationalism as long 
as it suits him. Then when he has gone too far, when it looks like 
he might be hit in earnest by NATO, he withdraws. Despite worldwide 
condemnation, Milosevic's crackdown in Kosovo plays well to a domestic 
audience. Serbs insist Kosovo is their cradle of religious and cultural 
history. The way they see it, Albanian extremists seeking independence 
are trying to steal something sacred. All the truth, the facts are 
on the side of Serbia, we are protecting our territory. And as for 
the recent massacres that might compel NAto to attack, the Serbs insist 
hundreds of their people also have been killed. Let's investigate, 
let's investigate all crimes, and after that we can talk about punishing 
or not punishing Serbia. After years of sanctions and isolation, people 
here feel, bitter about threats of NATO air strikes. "The problems 
in Kosovo," he says, "should be solved by our country's laws." Many 
here feel that once again, it's only the Serbs taking the blame. While 
Yugoslavia's leaders say they're doing everything possible to stop 
the bloodshed in Kosovo, the problem is they've made the same promises 
many times before, assurances which have been temporary or simply 
not true. Ron Allen, NBC news, Belgrade.
