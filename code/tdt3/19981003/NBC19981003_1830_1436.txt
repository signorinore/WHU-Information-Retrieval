When "NBC nightly news" continues in a moment -- the monkey business 
they're coping with in some cities in central Japan. Hey, you want 
a green light to eat like never before? i do. Healthy choice has a 
whole menu of unbelievably delicious dishes. Incredible meals. New 
chicken stirfry with a crispy, fried egg roll. G hearty handfuls stuffed 
end to end with gooey cheese. My favorite, shrimp and vegetables with 
bow-tie pasta... in a creamy basil garlic sauce, mm-hmm. All around 
five grams of fat. Five. Ere's no stoppin' me now. Healthy choice. 
your green light to eat what you like. These days, everything's faster. 
So how come pain relief isn't faster? Introducing Advil liqui-gels-- 
on tough pain, they're stronger and faster... than extra strength 
Tylenol. New Advil liqui-gels. Pain relief just got faster. You already 
know how important calcium is for your bones, but did you know that 
85 percent of women still don't get enough? So start your day with 
total. It's the only leading cereal... that's an excellent source 
of calcium, even before adding milk. In fact, total has more calcium 
than the milk itself. No other leading cereal comes close. Simple. 
Low fat. Delicious. So good, you can feel it in your bones. Total, 
total raisin bran, total corn flakes.
