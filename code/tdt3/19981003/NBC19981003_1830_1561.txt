And now this story. There are bandits on the loose in parts of Japan. 
Well, they're actually menacing monkeys who are stealing in broad 
daylight. Here's NBC's kiko Itasaka. At this 17th-century shrine, 
an illustration of an ancient proverb -- "hear no evil, see no evil, 
speak no evil." But these real-life monkeys are full of malicious 
mischief. The macaca fuscata have lived for centuries in the Nikko 
mountains of Japan, feeding on leaves, seeds and the occasional insect. 
But now, they routinely head down from the mountains, in search of 
tastier food supplied by humans. I love the monkeys. Professor masaaki 
koganezawa has devoted his whole life to the study of monkeys. His 
research shows a dramatic change in monkey diet over the past decade. 
Bananas, apples. Food like candy and cake. He says, "don't blame the 
monkeys." It's because humans are always feeding the monkeys, fueling 
an insatiable desire for sweets. When they don't get enough handouts, 
they attack farmers' fields or steal what they want. And if at first 
they don't succeed, they just try again -- and again. So now, the 
humans are waging war against the monkeys -- shooting to scare, not 
kill -- and using high-tech tracking methods, attaching transmitters 
to monkeys, then monitoring their movements with radar. Ichitaro Shimizu 
is a one-man monkey patrol. His mission -- keep the animals out of 
farmers' fields. But, he says, usually, the monkeys outmaneuver him. 
My goal is just to scare them, but they're just too clever. So far, 
there are no signs this monkey mania is letting up. Increasingly, 
bolder monkeys are now even invading major cities, like Osaka, and 
creating havoc. Scientists say the only solution is to start a major 
education drive to teach humans not to feed the monkeys and to encourage 
the monkeys to return to their natural habitat. But as long as people 
ignore requests to stop the roadside feedings, this sort of monkey 
business will only get worse. Kiko Itasaka, NBC news, Nikko.
