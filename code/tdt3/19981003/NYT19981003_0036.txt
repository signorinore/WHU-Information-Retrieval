The police said Friday night that they were investigating the case 
of a Haitian immigrant who went into a coma shortly after being taken 
into police custody in Brooklyn last week. The man, Jean Ulrick Charles, 
53, is in critical condition and remains in a coma at the Brooklyn 
Hospital Center, where he was admitted on Sept. 24, a hospital spokeswoman 
said last night. Police officials said Charles had apparently suffered 
a stroke. ``We do not feel that his condition has any connection to 
his being in our custody,'' Marilyn Mode, the department's Deputy 
Commissioner for Public Information, said Friday night. But relatives 
of Charles said they had many questions about his condition and the 
reason for his arrest. His son, Jean Robert Charles, 26, also said 
at a news conference at the hospital Friday night that there were 
welts on his father's face. The younger Charles was accompanied by 
Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant who has accused officers at the 
70th Precinct of brutally torturing him last year, and by Samuel Nicolas, 
Louima's cousin and spokesman. ``The question we have is how this 
man went to a police precinct and wound up in a coma,'' Nicolas said. 
``No one will answer our questions.'' The police said in a written 
statement that Charles turned himself in to the Brooklyn South Task 
Force on Coney Island Avenue at about 9 a.m. on Sept. 24 in response 
to a bench warrant, though the statement did not say why the warrant 
had been issued. At about 9:40 a.m., Charles was taken to Brooklyn 
Criminal Court, where he suffered a seizure, the statement said. He 
was then taken to the hospital. Charles' doctor told investigators 
that he had severely high blood pressure and suffered a stroke when 
a blood clot formed in his brain, the statement said. He had surgery 
to relieve pressure on the brain. Because Charles was hospitalized 
while in the custody of the police, the department's Internal Affairs 
Bureau investigated the incident, the statement said.
