I am ashamed,'' wrote Fanny Burney, the English novelist, in 1778, 
``of confessing that I have nothing to confess.'' If she were alive 
today, she might have put her talents to use as a speech writer or 
maybe a deposition coach for President Clinton, so perfect was her 
grasp of the convoluting concept of shame. Shaming people in public 
has always been a tantalizing idea to Americans _ punishing wrongdoers 
by making them hang their heads before their community. But a few 
years ago, there was a new burst of interest in shaming. Judges began 
to order thieves to wear sandwich boards and walk outside the stores 
they had stolen from. And the courts ordered people convicted of assault 
or child molestation to put signs in their yards announcing their 
transgressions. Now, Clinton's opera of embarrassment has brought 
public shaming to a new high. More than ever, it appears, people are 
in the mood for good old red-faced humiliation. These days, you can 
get shamed on television, on the World Wide Web, on the bumper sticker 
of your car. In June, ``Forgive or Forget,'' a nationally syndicated 
TV show, premiered, featuring people wringing out their guilt and 
begging for forgiveness. A woman is ashamed that she let her boyfriend 
think he was the father of her baby. A man is sorry he lost touch 
with his daughter for years. A woman blames herself for getting her 
sister addicted to drugs. They apologize, they confess, they grovel. 
And then, at the prompting of the host, a woman named Mother Love, 
they stand before a door on stage and nervously open it. If their 
victim is on the other side, they kiss and make up. If no one is there, 
the guilty one is left to dissolve in tearful desperation before the 
camera. Then there is the Scarlet Letter ethic. This summer, a judge 
in Massachusetts said chronic drunk drivers could be ordered to put 
bright orange bumper stickers on their cars announcing their problem 
and urging other drivers to report ``erratic driving'' to the police. 
In Minneapolis, the police department has organized ``shaming details,'' 
in which people arrested for soliciting prostitution and other street 
crimes are hauled in front of community members waiting at the precinct 
house. As the accused stand before them handcuffed, the citizens let 
loose with a kind of verbal stoning. They scold, saying things like, 
``You're the reason our children aren't safe in this neighborhood,'' 
said Lt. Marie Przynski, who started the shaming program in the police 
precinct she commands. Afterward, the accused are released, but the 
arrests stay on their records and their names and license plate numbers 
are given to neighborhood leaders. ``The community loves it,'' Lieutenant 
Przynski said. Last year, Kansas City, Mo., started ``John TV,'' in 
which the names, mug shots, birth dates and hometowns of men arrested 
for trying to buy sex, and women arrested for trying to sell, it are 
broadcast on the municipal cable channel. Mug shots of such dignitaries 
as a fire department captain and a former federal prosecutor have 
been shown, said Teresa Loar, the city councilwoman who sponsored 
the legislation that created ``John TV.'' Thanks to popular demand, 
she said, the show is now run four times each Wednesday, up from once 
when it started. Its popularity has inspired another show, ``Slumlord 
of the Month.'' The slumlord theme is big from Syracuse, which last 
year began posting ``Slum Property'' signs in front of decrepit buildings, 
to Des Moines, where officials recently decided to publish the names 
of the owners of the city's worst properties. With all this energy 
invested in humiliation, does it work? Nobody really knows yet, experts 
say. In Kansas City, Sgt. Jim Connelly, supervisor of the police department's 
vice unit, said the success of ``John TV'' was hard to measure. The 
recidivism rate has not changed, he said, but some men seem to be 
more cautious about whom they pick up, fearing that the women may 
be undercover officers. ``It's not a cure-all,'' he said. ``I wish 
it was.'' And was the decision of a woman in Eau Claire, Wis., a positive 
result or a negative one? Convicted of welfare fraud, she chose to 
go to jail instead of suffer the embarrassment of wearing a sign that 
said, ``I stole food from poor people.'' Dan Kahan, a professor at 
the University of Chicago Law School, thinks shaming is generally 
a good idea because it provides an inexpensive and morally satisfying 
alternative to imprisonment. ``Fines and community service don't strike 
people as appropriate,'' he said. ``They don't seem to be serious 
enough to fit the crime, and community service seems uplifting rather 
than downgrading.'' Some critics object to shaming because it can 
also humiliate innocent family members who live in the house with 
the sign outside or drive the car with the bumper sticker on it. June 
Tangney, a professor of psychology at George Mason University in Fairfax, 
Va., says shaming may make society feel good, but it is unlikely to 
succeed at changing the behavior of the person being humiliated, especially 
since those people are used to flouting society's rules. ``Feelings 
of shame can actually have some pretty unintended negative consequences,'' 
said Tangney, who has studied shame among people who have made non-criminal 
mistakes. ``When people feel shamed or humiliated, they're likely 
to want to hide and likely to avoid taking responsibility,'' she said. 
``If we are holding the person up to public humiliation, the offender's 
focus then is on themselves and how they're being badly treated, rather 
than a focus on the behavior and the consequences of the behavior.'' 
Will Rogers may have had the best advice. ``Live in such a way,'' 
he said, ``that you would not be ashamed to sell your parrot to the 
town gossip.''
