In the days before Hurricane Georges struck the Gulf Coast last week, 
storm forecasters faced one of their most trying responsibilities: 
predicting the inherently uncertain behavior of a hurricane in time 
to move people out of harm's way. The basic problem is that even though 
experts have improved their ability to forecast the track of a hurricane 
by 30 or 40 percent in the last decade or so, the predictions are 
still off, on average, by about 200 miles 72 hours before the storm's 
expected landfall. In extreme cases, it takes 72 hours to carry out 
a mass evacuation. Even 12 hours ahead, the error is still 40 to 50 
miles. When it comes to predicting the intensity of a storm when it 
reaches land, forecasters admit they have even less skill. And they 
have almost none in forecasting how large an area the hurricane will 
affect once it comes ashore. ``We're back in the dark ages relative 
to that,'' said Jerry Jarrell, the director of the National Hurricane 
Center in Miami. ``I'm not sure anyone knows where to begin to attack 
that problem.'' So what do forecasters do? ``The cardinal rule is 
that you can't afford to get people killed because you're underprepared,'' 
Jarrell said as the center began to wind down from its encounter with 
Georges late last week. ``So you have to overprepare. It's just that 
simple.'' That means erring on the side of caution and issuing hurricane 
watches for areas where the odds of the storm striking may be low. 
But this carries a risk of its own. ``If you overprepare too much,'' 
said Jarrell, ``you're going to have a public that doesn't believe 
you.'' After Georges ripped through the Caribbean, killing more than 
300 people and leaving more than 150,000 homeless, it forced 30,000 
to flee the Florida Keys and prompted the authorities to urge or order 
some 1.5 million people to evacuate Louisiana alone. Thousands more 
were told to leave coastal areas of Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida 
panhandle. But clearly not everyone fled. In fact, more people stayed 
in the Keys than left. The use and misuse of predictions in many fields 
is a topic only now receiving attention from scientists, and uncertainty 
haunts almost all attempts to predict natural phenomena. The atmosphere 
presents a particularly tough problem because its fluid behavior is 
so chaotic and unpredictable. With hurricanes, ``There is always error 
in the forecast, and always will be'' said Dr. Jerry Mahlman, director 
of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical 
Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton University. ``The trick is 
to pound the error down.'' Mahlman's laboratory has played a major 
role in reducing the margin of error. Its global computer model of 
hurricane behavior, in operation since 1995, is largely responsible 
for the recent improvement in forecasting hurricane tracks. It is 
now the official lead prediction model _ first among a group of models 
_ used both by the National Hurricane Center and the Navy. Thirty-six 
hours before Georges hit land, the center correctly predicted that 
the storm would curl to the northeast of New Orleans. As coastal development 
along the Gulf and the Atlantic has blossomed in the last few decades, 
expanding populations have made evacuation an increasingly time-consuming 
and disruptive exercise. But it isn't simply a matter of inconvenience. 
Estimates have put the cost of evacuating a hurricane-prone stretch 
of built-up coastline at hundreds of thousands of dollars a mile or 
more. A false alarm, then, is not to be shrugged off, nor is the burden 
it puts on forecasters. ``These folks in the hurricane center are 
under incredible pressures and I think they do marvelously well in 
the face of those pressures,'' Mahlman said. The Hurricane Center 
errs on the side of safety in two ways when it issues hurricane warnings, 
Jarrell said. First, it expands the area that it expects will actually 
experience hurricane-force winds. ``We know we're overwarning probably 
by a factor of two,'' he said. This, he said, is an attempt to issue 
an honest forecast while at the same time ``telling people how to 
allow for error.'' The second way of building in a margin of safety, 
he said, is to encourage local officials and other disaster managers 
to make their preparations as if the hurricane will be one category 
stronger than the forecast specifies. Hurricane intensity is rated 
in categories from 1 to 5, with 5 the strongest. Sometimes, Jarrell 
acknowledged, the caution does seem to be excessive in retrospect. 
He also acknowledged the risk that if this happens too much, people 
will not accept the forecasts in the future. But the exercise is a 
tradeoff between that risk and the need for people to respond to the 
threat of immediate danger. ``I guess you hope their memory's not 
that long,'' he said. In the end, Jarrell said, the greatest value 
of improved hurricane forecasts may be that bigger stretches of coastline 
can now be eliminated from concern when warnings are issued. ``We 
are expanding the number of people who don't have to worry,'' he said.
