A new law that tightens U.S. borders by tracking every foreigner who 
enters the United States has been postponed because immigration officials 
say they are not ready to handle the job and Congress is not sure 
it really wants the measure enforced. Congress now has until Oct. 
15 to either repeal the law or delay it long enough for the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service to develop a system for keeping tabs on 
the millions of noncitizens who enter and leave the United States 
at every airport, border crossing and seaport in the country. Border 
states and the governments of Canada and Mexico strongly opposed the 
measure after experts warned that requiring even simple checks could 
cause huge lineups at the borders and delays of up to 24 hours that 
would hurt businesses and cost millions of dollars in delayed or lost 
trade. The measure officially took effect Thursday, but Congress voted 
to delay it because the INS made it clear it had not developed adequate 
technology to gather the information without causing delays. The agency 
also does not have a system to process information estimated to be 
so vast that in one year it would exceed all the data in the Library 
of Congress. ``This temporary delay will provide several more days 
for Congress to pass a legislative fix and prevent gridlock at our 
borders,'' said Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., who wrote the stopgap 
legislation. The Senate has already voted twice to repeal the strict 
border measure. The House of Representatives, however, had voted to 
delay its implementation one year, until Oct. 1, 1999. But because 
both houses could not reach a compromise, the measure went into effect 
Thursday. And when the immigration service did not enforce it, the 
government agency was in the position of technically violating the 
law. ``We told Congress early on that the technology and system did 
not exist and would not be in place by Oct. 1,'' said Russell Bergeron, 
an immigration service spokesman. ``And it's impossible to project 
when such a system would be in place.'' Canadian business executives 
and Mexican officials were relieved that the delays they feared had 
not materialized, but they remain concerned that uncertainty on the 
border still can cause hardship. ``You can't make plans to build cars 
in Detroit based on parts made in Canada that might be held up by 
10 to 20 hours crossing the border,'' said Peter Eide, head of labor 
law policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and chairman of Americans 
for Better Borders, an organization started by individuals worried 
about the effect of the new law. Gustavo Mohar, minister of governmental 
affairs at the Mexican Embassy in Washington, said Mexico wants the 
measure repealed. ``Regardless of the technology available,'' Mohar 
said, ``it doesn't make sense.'' This latest border battle started 
with a measure buried deep in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant 
Responsibility Act of 1996. Section 110 of that act required the immigration 
service to develop an automated system to track the entry and exit 
of all noncitizens, thus providing a way of identifying immigrants 
who stay longer than their visas allow. While the new law would affect 
both the Canadian and the Mexican borders if applied, opposition has 
been strongest in the north, where millions of Canadians are accustomed 
to crossing the border without being checked.
