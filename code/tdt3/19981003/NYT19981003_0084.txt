In an instant, millions of people disappear from the face of the earth, 
shedding their clothing, shoes, eyeglasses and jewelry. While terrified 
relatives grieve, the speculation begins. Were they snatched by aliens? 
Vaporized by a spontaneous chemical reaction? Kidnapped by terrorists? 
No, what has occurred is the Rapture. Jesus Christ has returned to 
take the genuine Christians to heaven, fulfilling the biblical prophecy 
in the Book of Revelation. The rest of humankind is left behind to 
suffer seven years of social chaos, wars, a killer earthquake and 
the wrath of the Antichrist, who achieves global omnipotence as secretary 
general of the United Nations. So goes the plot of ``Left Behind,'' 
a series of four books of apocalyptic fiction that have sold nearly 
3 million copies, about as many as the typical John Grisham novel. 
The series made publishing history in September when all four of the 
books ascended to the top four slots on Publishers Weekly magazine's 
lists of religion best sellers in hardcover and paperback. The ``Left 
Behind'' phenomenon, scholars say, is one indication of the public's 
fixation on the approaching millennium and the widespread anticipation 
that the year 2000 portends some earth-shattering event. While the 
``Left Behind'' series, co-written by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, 
relies on a controversial interpretation of the Bible embraced by 
many evangelical and fundamentalist Christians, publishing analysts 
say that the books have crossed over into a broader audience, attracting 
even secular readers with prose that reads like a paperback thriller. 
``They're cashing in on the public preoccupation with the year 2000,'' 
said Paul Boyer, a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin 
and author of ``When Time Shall Be No More: Prophecy Belief in Modern 
American Culture'' (Harvard University Press, 1992). ``The message 
is that you can't do anything about what's happening in the world. 
The larger pattern of prophecy is unfolding, but you can save yourself, 
so accept Christ today, and you will be among those who are Raptured. 
You will be saved.'' The ``Left Behind'' books are among a proliferation 
of books on the final days that are best sellers at Christian bookstores. 
Among them are ``Prosperity and the Coming Apocalypse'' by Jim Bakker, 
the television evangelist once tainted by scandal, with Ken Abraham, 
and ``Final Dawn Over Jerusalem'' by John Hagee, a religious broadcaster. 
Both books were published this year by Thomas Nelson Publishers. But 
the ``Left Behind'' series has managed to cross over from Christian 
to secular audience by selling well in commercial outlets like Wal-Mart, 
Target and Kmart, said Phyllis Tickle, contributing editor in religion 
at Publishers Weekly. ``This says that indeed they have pervaded our 
culture,'' she said. The most recent book in the series, all published 
by Tyndale House Publishers, is ``Soul Harvest.'' It was released 
in June and occupies the top spot on the religion hardcover list, 
while the top three religion paperback spots are occupied by the series' 
first three books: ``Left Behind'' (1995), ``Tribulation Force'' (1996) 
and ``Nicolae'' (1997). Readers are writing the publisher's Web site, 
which receives about 80,000 electronic visits every day, to say that 
the books have prompted them, their friends or family members to become 
born-again Christians. The books have also generated a companion children's 
series, a music CD and hats and T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan 
``Don't Be Left Behind.'' The authors plan to write at least four 
more books for the adult series and a movie is in the works. LaHaye 
is an evangelical Christian minister, a conservative political commentator 
and the author of 35 books on family life, creationism and biblical 
prophecy. Jenkins is a former journalist who has written more than 
100 books, including marriage and family advice, biographies of sports 
figures, and who writes a syndicated comic strip, ``Gil Thorp.'' Both 
authors say they believe that the Rapture could take place at any 
moment because, they say, every major prophecy that the Bible says 
will precede the Rapture has already been fulfilled. Even though the 
books make no explicit reference to the year 2000, they are set in 
the present or the very near future and make reference to popular 
fears of social, economic and political turbulence. LaHaye even interprets 
the year 2000 computer problem, in which computers that use two digits 
to indicate the year may interpret 2000 as 1900, as a sign of the 
coming apocalypse. ``It very well could trigger a financial meltdown,'' 
LaHaye told readers on the Web site, ``leading to an international 
depression, which would make it possible for the Antichrist or his 
emissaries to establish a one-world currency or a one-world economic 
system, which will dominate the world commercially until it is destroyed.'' 
The ``Left Behind'' books are intended to appeal not only to committed 
Christians, but also to half-hearted churchgoers and skeptical seculars, 
Jenkins said. The formula combines Tom Clancy-like suspense with touches 
of romance, high-tech flash and biblical references. ``The way to 
make prophecy clear to people,'' Jenkins said, ``is to put it in fiction, 
to say, `If this was you, here's what would happen, here's how a normal 
person would react if they were left behind.' I don't think I'm going 
to be left behind, but you can just imagine the horror if that happened 
to you.'' Carol Robison, a day-care worker in Ozark, Mo., said in 
an interview: ``The book puts it in focus for you _ this is what is 
going to happen. I think the Antichrist is going to come the way it 
does in the book. There's going to be world peace, and one-world religion, 
and the currency will turn to one currency. And I honestly think it's 
going to come in the next couple of years.'' The books are being used 
as a tool for evangelism, drawing in non-Christians or those who have 
left the church. Aaron Williamson, 33, who said he had become ``disillusioned 
with religion'' and left the church as a teen-ager, was given a copy 
of ``Left Behind'' by his supervisor at a warehouse company in Richmond, 
Va. Williamson said he had been apprehensive about starting the book 
but finally read one page and was hooked. ``It impacted me more than 
any book I've ever read before,'' Williamson said. ``I do read a lot 
of science fiction, but this is the first one that actually seemed 
like it could happen.'' In their collaboration, LaHaye wrote out chronological 
charts explaining his interpretation of the sequence of events in 
the Book of Revelation, and Jennings used those as a framework for 
creating the characters and plot twists. Revelation is the New Testament's 
final book, which has been interpreted through the ages in myriad 
ways. Some consider it a historical allegory about the Roman Empire's 
oppression of Jesus' followers, while those who read the Bible literally 
tend to regard Revelation as prediction. The heroes in ``Left Behind'' 
are Rayford Steele, a 747 airline pilot whose devout Christian wife 
and young son have disappeared in the Rapture, and Buck Williams, 
a cynical journalist for a weekly magazine whose assignment is to 
find out the truth behind the disappearances. After realizing what 
has happened to his wife and son, Steele turns to Christ and gradually 
convinces his skeptical daughter, Chloe, and Williams to believe the 
Rapture has occurred, confess their sins and accept Christ. The three 
of them join the ``Tribulation Force,'' a crew of committed Christians 
secretly fighting the evil Antichrist. The Antichrist appears disguised 
as a charismatic Romanian politician named Nicolae Carpathia, who 
takes over the United Nations and quickly establishes one-world government, 
one religion and one currency. The plot's suspense relies on the assumption 
that the people ``left behind'' after the Rapture still have a chance 
to declare for Christ and save their souls. But this is an interpretation 
of the Book of Revelation that, while defended by LaHaye with citations 
from Scripture, many Christians and scholars of the New Testament 
find highly unorthodox. John J. Collins, a professor at the University 
of Chicago Divinity School and an editor of the ``Encyclopedia of 
Apocalypticism'' (Continuum, 1998), said in an interview: ``What I've 
not heard of is an interval for repenters after the first Rapture. 
That's news to me. It's an interpretation that is far from standard.''
