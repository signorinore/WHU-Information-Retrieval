Jay Leno does not see himself as a political or human rights activist. 
And his wife, Mavis, generally has, as she describes it, ``less than 
no interest'' in drawing public attention to herself. But they both 
feel strongly that the world is not paying enough attention to the 
catastrophe that has fallen upon the women of Afghanistan. In a telephone 
conversation last week, Leno said, ``I remember being in the sixth 
or seventh grade and we were reading about World War II. And I remember 
kids asking, `So when they were rounding up the Jewish people and 
killing them, why didn't people do something?' ``And I remember thinking, 
`I guess people were just different then. It was a different time. 
That couldn't happen now.''' What is happening in Afghanistan now 
is nothing short of a war on women and girls. Most of the country 
is under the control of the Taliban, an extremist Islamic movement 
that has thrown a blanket of absolute oppression over the lives of 
all females. Women are not allowed to work outside the home. Girls 
are not allowed to go to school. No female is permitted to leave her 
home unless she is accompanied by a close male relative _ a husband, 
father, brother or son. Homes and other buildings in which women or 
girls might be present must have their windows painted so no female 
can be seen from outside. Women who leave their homes must be completely 
covered by a burqa, an all-encompassing garment with a small mesh 
opening through which the wearer can see and breathe. Women are not 
allowed to wear shoes that make any noise when they walk. Their footsteps 
must not be heard. They must come and go in silence. Violations of 
any of the Taliban's edicts are treated summarily and brutally. It 
is like a reprise of some dark, medieval period. Women who ventured 
from their homes unaccompanied or improperly clad have been whipped, 
beaten and at times killed. A woman was dragged from a vehicle and 
viciously beaten because her arm accidentally slipped into view. Another 
woman was stoned to death when she attempted to leave the country 
with a man who was not a relative. Very few medical facilities are 
available to women, and women are so frightened of being flogged or 
beaten in the streets they often are reluctant to seek the little 
help that is available. Even the most serious illnesses are going 
untreated. The prohibition against work has had a profound effect. 
Women and girls who do not have male relatives to support them have 
been left destitute. Not surprisingly, human rights groups are finding 
extraordinary levels of anxiety and depression in the women they see. 
Mavis Leno is on the board of the Feminist Majority, an organization 
that is committed to easing the plight of the women in Afghanistan. 
She will help lead the group's effort to bring the story more fully 
to public view. ``Every person I've spoken to about this is outraged,'' 
she said. ``And so many have had the same reaction: `Why don't I know 
about this? How can this be going on and I haven't heard about it?' 
And that's what I want to remedy.'' The Lenos are contributing $100,000 
to assist the Feminist Majority in its efforts to assist the victims 
of the Taliban. The idea is to focus a brighter spotlight on the tragedy. 
A press conference will be held next week to formally announce the 
campaign to bring more and more information about this overwhelming 
injustice to the public's attention. Ms. Leno, in an interview, mentioned 
that her father had once been buried for a time in a mining accident. 
``He was dug out and he was fine,'' she said. ``But he told me that 
while he was buried the hardest thing was that he had no way of being 
sure that anybody was looking for him. They could think that maybe 
he hadn't gone to work that day, or that he was someplace else, not 
buried. Or maybe they would think, yes, he was buried, but he was 
dead. Maybe they wouldn't look for him. ``That's what came to my mind 
when I heard about the situation with the women in Afghanistan. They 
don't even know if anybody knows what has happened to them. They don't 
even know if people are trying to save them. And that seemed so terrible 
to me that I felt I had to be one of the people that was looking for 
them.''
