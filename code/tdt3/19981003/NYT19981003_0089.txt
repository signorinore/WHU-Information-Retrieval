Some have questioned the wisdom of Kenneth Starr's hanging the fate 
of the Republic on the neurotic girl talk of two dingbats. But the 
massive, 4,600-page, three-tome ``Communication'' released on Friday 
by the prosecutor will be an eye-opener for his critics. Linda Tripp 
and Monica Lewinsky have been depicted as epic quisling and epic minx. 
But this Niagara of secretly taped small talk from the government 
Printing Office reveals them to be so much more. Once you get past 
her Valley Girlisms _ ``da, da, da,'' ``blah, blah, blah,'' ``ugh,'' 
``yech,'' ``like, Hel-lo?'' and ``the me issue'' _ young Monica turns 
out to be something of a philosopher. At the Pentagon City Ritz-Carlton, 
over a hamburger, crispy french fries and coffee with artificial sweetener 
_ ``I need both the pink and the blue,'' she informs the waitress 
_ the 24-year-old expounds on the meaning of truth. Like her former 
boyfriend, Monica is a relativist. Ms. Tripp: ``The truth shall set 
you free. Yeah.'' Ms. Lewinsky: ``But think about the truth _ OK? 
Think about truth. Truth is synonymous with good. Truth is supposed 
to be good ... OK? ... This is how I have looked at it, and this is 
from my Christian Scientist, from talking to this woman, and I have 
talked to her and I've said, `Well, what about' _ you know, I said, 
`If truth is synonymous with good, then truth is good and good is 
God, OK? If all those things are synonymous, then the right thing 
to do is not hurt someone.' That's true ... So the truth, well, what 
is truth? I mean, I'm not trying to have an existential conversation 
with you.'' After a few ``Hmpfs,'' Ms. Tripp muses: ``I think everybody 
has a moral code of some sort.'' Ms. Lewinsky: ``We do. But to everybody 
it's different. Do you see what I mean? OK.'' Ms. Tripp catches on: 
``But what I understand you saying is ... that if an issue of any 
sort arises that if the ultimate good is _ and _ and the truth _ the 
truth should match the ultimate good and be both.'' Ms. Lewinsky: 
``Mm-hmmm.'' Ms. Tripp: ``I see what you're saying. I do.'' Ms. Lewinsky: 
``You know?'' Monica later takes another Pilate-like crack at the 
meaning of truth, telling Linda that ``The truth is _ the truth is 
_ what it should be,'' and explaining: ``God is synonymous with good, 
truth and kindness and happiness and all sorts of good things.'' Ms. 
Tripp: ``This is too big to worry about goodness and kindness.'' Both 
women have a sophisticated grasp of history. Monica explains that 
her mother wants her to lie about the Presidential affair because 
she is fearful for her daughter's safety: ``She keeps saying `Mary 
Jo Chappaquiddick' or whatever her name was.'' Linda also reflects 
on the historical dimension of the drama. Ms. Tripp: ``The president 
of the United States.'' Ms. Lewinsky: ``Right.'' Ms. Tripp: ``Which 
is huge.'' Ms. Lewinsky: ``Right.'' Ms. Tripp: ``Huge.'' Ms. Lewinsky: 
``Mm-hmmm.'' Ms. Tripp: ``Don't you think?'' Ms. Lewinsky: ``Yeah, 
I do.'' Linda later says of Vernon Jordan: ``He's like the biggest 
... He is huge.'' The pair are wise in the Byzantine ways of Washington. 
Ms. Lewinsky: ``There are three kinds of people in this administration: 
peons, peons who know stuff, and FOB's. OK. Maybe not peons who know 
stuff. In between. Do you know what I mean? Do you know what I'm saying 
now?'' Ms. Tripp takes up the question of status and fate: ``It's 
interesting to me as a low-level peon ...'' Ms. Lewinsky: ``If you're 
a low-level peon, what am I?'' Ms. Tripp: ``You're a player in this. 
I'm a low-level peon.'' Ms. Lewinsky: ``If I'm a player, you're a 
player.'' Ms. Tripp: ``No, I'm no player.'' Monica is patriotic. ``To 
me,'' she ruminates about her Oval Office trysts, ``a little bit of 
_ it's for the country. Every president we ever had has always had 
lovers because the pressure of the job is too much. Too much ... Too 
much, to always rely on your wife, with whom you have too much baggage 
_ which you inevitably will if you got to that point ... Would you 
agree with me on that? ... Can we get some ketchup and mustard?''
