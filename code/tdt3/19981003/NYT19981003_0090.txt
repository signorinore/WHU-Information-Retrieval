Transparency International, a small independent organization that 
has been tracking for four years how the public and international 
businesses view corruption worldwide, has published its largest survey 
to date, looking at 85 countries and ranking only one completely clean: 
Denmark. The 1998 Corruption Perception Index, like its predecessors, 
is a ``survey of surveys,'' using a combination of studies by risk 
analysts, opinion polls and research institutions to rank countries 
by how they are perceived. ``No surveying approach is perfect,'' Frank 
Vogl, vice president of Transparency International and a former World 
Bank official, said of the report released in late September. ``At 
best we get a good set of impressions.'' The impressions this year 
are that all but 3 of the top 10 countries in the least-corrupt category 
are European _ Denmark, followed by Finland, Sweden, New Zealand, 
Iceland, Canada, Singapore, the Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland. 
At the other end of the scale, from the bottom up, are Cameroon, Paraguay, 
Honduras, Tanzania, Nigeria, Indonesia, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, 
Russia and Vietnam and Kenya in a tie. The United States falls behind 
most European countries and Hong Kong, tying with Austria at 17th 
place. The annual index has provoked criticisms from countries that 
rank low on the trust scale, among them Cameroon. ``The Cameroon government 
condemns strongly the arrogance of certain bodies that are in the 
pay of neo-colonial clusters of people at work to impede the progress 
of our countries instead of supporting efforts and sacrifices made 
by our people,'' the government said in an official radio announcement. 
But Transparency International is not alone in drawing attention to 
corruption through its branches in all parts of the world. In September, 
the U.N. Development Program and the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development joined forces to publish a study of anticorruption 
initiatives in 25 countries that serve as models in the battle against 
bribery, money laundering and other impediments to economic growth. 
``The international community's concern with corruption issues is 
not a passing phenomenon,'' top officials in the two organizations 
wrote in a preface to the report, ``Corruption and Integrity Improvement 
Initiatives in Developing Countries.'' It called for ``concrete measures 
_ preventive as well as punitive _ that address issues of accountability, 
transparency and inequity at various levels of social and economic 
systems.'' Djibril Diallo, public affairs director of the U.N. Development 
Program, said at a news conference that corruption is thought to siphon 
billions of dollars out of development each year. The OECD has been 
working toward making the payment of bribes illegal in Europe, where 
some countries still permit tax deductions for such payments by businesses. 
The United States, with its 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, has 
been a leader in trying to stem the tide of bribery in international 
business. Officials at Transparency International say they are now 
working on a Bribery Propensity Index to balance its Corruption Perceptions 
Index in the future. The 1998 corruption index can be found through 
the Internet at www.transparency.de.
