Not only have Dick Gephardt and Bill Clinton never been close, but 
sometimes they have acted as if they belonged to separate political 
parties. So it seems strange, and occasionally gives the White House 
a bad case of the jitters, that the phlegmatic House minority leader 
from Missouri is now the president's first line of defense as the 
House prepares to vote this week on whether to open a full impeachment 
inquiry. Gephardt can only say of his role, ``I've given up thinking 
that anything in politics is weird or ironic, because so much is. 
It's kind of like life.'' Though he is a very contained man, he does 
not hide his frustration with Clinton. ``I'm angry at him,'' he said, 
emphasizing the word ``angry,'' during a break in his now constant 
whirl of meetings with nervous Democrats looking for a way to survive 
the Clinton scandal in the coming mid-term elections. ``But I would 
assume he's angry at himself,'' he added. ``I mean this was not good. 
This was bad. At some point I'll talk about it in greater detail. 
It was very wrong. It has not helped anything or anybody. It has been 
harmful. The question is what do you do about it?'' He might have 
let the president twist in the wind, in the same way that House Democrats 
feel Clinton treated them by governing, for a period, with congressional 
Republicans. After all, the president's Oval Office fling with a White 
House intern, and his deceptions about it, have now probably dashed 
Democrats' hopes that they might win back the House this year, a victory 
that would have propelled Gephardt forward as speaker to replace Newt 
Gingrich. But this is a high-stakes moment, not just for the president 
but for his reeling party. And so Gephardt has taken a firm hands-on 
role in leading House Democrats in these dangerous days, through events 
that some strategists fear could ruin the party's chances in 2000 
and for as much as a decade to come. Democrats may complain about 
Gingrich playing a part in impeachment. But the fractious Democrats 
on the House Judiciary Committee meet regularly and unabashedly with 
Gephardt and his senior staff in his jumbled suite of offices off 
the House floor. It was Gephardt who took the lead in selecting the 
House Judiciary Committee's Democratic impeachment staff _ from senior 
investigator Abbe Lowell, a hard-driving Washington lawyer, to the 
aggressive press spokesman James Jordan, who was seasoned by representing 
Democrats in the bitterly partisan campaign finance hearings in the 
Senate and in House investigations into the Teamsters union. In ceaseless 
meetings with every faction of the House Democrats, Gephardt has searched 
for a party consensus on just how far to go to protect the president 
from the impeachment drive. ``He is the greatest listener in the world,'' 
said one Democratic strategist of Gephardt. ``People laugh about Clinton 
_ you sit down with him and don't get a word in. Dick Gephardt will 
listen to individuals for hours.'' Asked whether he has held many 
one-on-one meetings with House Democrats. Gephardt answered: ``Ones, 
fives, tens, 20s, 50s, 100s. You name it. We've done it.'' At the 
moment, White House officials insist they are delighted with Gephardt, 
who in August refused to rule out Clinton's impeachment but now has 
become a leading voice lambasting the Republicans and crying out for 
a ``fair'' inquiry. But perhaps it should serve as a warning to the 
president that when Gephardt is asked precisely whom he represents, 
he says emphatically that his first responsibility is to House Democrats. 
``They elected me,'' he said. ``They want me to be their leader, and 
that's my job.'' He also notes that the president's rebound in the 
polls may not last. ``I have no idea what's going to happen,'' he 
said. ``None. Because it is volatile and I think all of us, I think 
every American that's looking at it, has very mixed and complicated 
feelings about it.'' Gephardt has a lot riding on his personal balancing 
act. He has been steadily charting a different course from Clinton's 
on pocketbook issues like trade policy. He opposed the president on 
the balanced budget agreement and on the 1996 welfare overhaul. And 
he is considering making his second presidential bid in 2000 as the 
liberal standard bearer against Clinton's ideological heir, Al Gore. 
He might yet, watchful Democrats say, emerge from the Clinton wreckage 
with greater stature as the not very flashy lawmaker who helped the 
country to a sensible resolution to the scandal engulfing the White 
House. On the other hand, he could very well alienate the left wing 
of the Democratic party which was supposed to be his base if he chose 
to make a presidential run. ``This is unquestionably a very tough 
situation to be in,'' said Bill Carrick, a California-based political 
consultant who was Gephardt's campaign manager in his failed bid for 
the 1988 presidential nomination. ``We've got a lot of hard-core Democratic 
voters in the country who have a view that what Ken Starr initiated 
is a modern-day witch hunt and everything the Republicans say or do 
on this is politically motivated.'' ``I think as a matter of responsible 
leadership Dick has to take a step back from that and try to make 
a more objective judgment,'' Carrick said. ``As a consequence, politically, 
it is not the best place for him to be in terms of winning a primary 
contest in 2000.'' Clinton tried to emphasize that point to Gephardt 
in August. Aides say Clinton was infuriated by Gephardt's early comments, 
in which he said he could not rule out the possibility that the president 
could be impeached. Gephardt quickly heard complaints about his stance 
_ not from Clinton, but from liberal stalwarts like the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson, labor leaders John Sweeney and Gerald McEntee, and Terry 
McAuliffe, who has served as a lead fund-raiser to both Clinton and 
Gephardt. Denise Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Sweeney, the head of 
the AFL-CIO, said Sweeney did talk by phone with Clinton once or twice 
while the president was on vacation on Martha's Vineyard but called 
Gephardt on his own to talk about Gephardt's position. ``He called 
because he thought it was hurtful to Gephardt and hurtful overall,'' 
she said. But Gephardt's aides said that several of those who called 
said they were doing the president's bidding. Gephardt and House Democratic 
aides sent their own volleys across the bow of the White House last 
week. James Carville, a Clinton confidant, brashly called impeachment 
a war between himself and Gingrich, and a host of liberal Democratic 
interest groups announced that they planned to sponsor a television 
ad campaign to strengthen Clinton and encourage Democratic turnout 
in the elections. The House strategists complained that such partisanship 
could backfire and that the ads could draw money away from needy Democrats 
in heated campaigns. Such a Clinton-based defense, they worried, might 
not help endangered Democrats in swing districts. In these strange 
days in Congress, Gephardt says he has been trying to write down his 
thoughts about politics, working on airplanes or before going to bed. 
``At some point I'm going to say something about what I think has 
happened to our political system,'' he promises. ``And it's larger 
than this.'' ``If you think about it,'' he said, ``the foundation, 
the heart, the fabric of democracy is motivated, interested, participating 
citizens, and we're eating away at that in the way this rolls out.'' 
But as if to disprove his point, Gephardt also admits he can't escape 
the citizenry. At 11 p.m. one night last week, he stopped into a Virginia 
supermarket after a late-night House session only to be accosted by 
shoppers who wanted to talk about Clinton. ``People in there came 
up and said, `I know who you are, now let me tell you,' '' Gephardt 
recounted. ``One person said, `Do not get rid of him. Do not get rid 
of him. What he did was wrong. He should be punished, but don't impeach 
him.'' Only under some prompting does he admit what the other shoppers 
told him. ``Others say, `Get rid of him,'' he said. `` `Oh absolutely. 
Tell him to resign. He's got to get out.' '' ``You can't say to them 
they don't know enough,'' he said, starting to laugh at the absurd 
turn politics has taken in an era when presidential indiscretions 
are transmitted on the Internet. ``They say, `I know too much.' ''
