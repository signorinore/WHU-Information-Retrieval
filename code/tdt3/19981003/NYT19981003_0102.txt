The New York Yankees had their way with the Texas Rangers and turned 
them into one-hit wonders. Next. ``They did what they wanted to do 
with us,'' Mark McLemore said early Saturday. ``They shut down our 
offense.'' McLemore was one of the Rangers' five one-hit wonders, 
the players who batted second through sixth in their lineup. McLemore, 
Rusty Greer, Juan Gonzalez, Will Clark and Ivan Rodriguez each managed 
one hit in the Yankees' sweep of their three-game division series. 
They batted a collective .093. Considering that the Rangers swung 
bats at opposing pitchers like machetes all season and joined the 
Yankees as the most ferocious offensive teams in the American League, 
the Yankees' pitchers have sent a frightening message to the next 
team or two they will play in this post-season. They held the Rangers 
to one run, a lone run, a mere run, a measly run. No pitching staff 
had ever held a team to one run in a post-season series, never in 
any of the 165 post-season series that had been played before this 
year, not in a strike-created extra series, not in a division series, 
not in a league championship series, not in a World Series. The Yankees 
held the Rangers to one run. They do not have to post the message 
on the signboard atop Yankee Stadium or on the message board alongside 
the Deegan or on the ribbon running around the building in Times Square 
for the remaining teams in the playoffs to learn of the remarkable 
feat. Those teams had scouts scrutinizing the Yankees in their past 
three games, and the scouts will write and relate horror stories to 
their employers. Just like they will tell frightening tales about 
Shane Spencer, whom Clark called ``the reincarnation of Babe Ruth'' 
after he hit his second series home run and his ninth home run in 
his last 10 games. ``The one guy we didn't know as much about was 
Spencer,'' said Doug Melvin, the Texas general manager, said. ``I 
don't know if he realizes this is the playoffs. Did he recognize that? 
He's not supposed to do that.'' Now the phenomenal rookie is someone 
else's problem. So are the pitchers. Todd Stottlemyre, son of the 
Yankees' pitching coach and victim of the first of those frighteningly 
good pitching performances, offered his own scouting report on David 
Wells, Andy Pettitte and David Cone: ``It starts with Wells. In August 
he pitched five or six innings and gave up five runs. Earlier in the 
year he pitched three, and he gave up nine. But in his last start 
against us, he executed. He pitched a great game here in September. 
He had the ball in on the right-handers, used his changeup, was always 
ahead. This is a free-swinging club. They swing early in the count. 
He stayed ahead. He executed that same type of game plan in Game 1. 
``Pettitte, to me, was so tough because he was ahead pretty often. 
He pitched different than some of the films we've seen. He threw the 
ball away from the hitters a lot more. He wasn't just jamming the 
cutter in on right-handers. He executed that game plan. ``I think 
sometimes when Cone picks his leg up he's not sure what he's going 
to throw. I think he invents it on the way there, so how can you come 
up with a game plan against a guy like David Cone? He's awesome. He's 
one of the great inventors. He has great stuff. He's a big-time pitcher. 
He's a gamer. He's the right guy that you want on the mound when you're 
trying to close something out.'' Cone closed out the Rangers with 
five and two-thirds innings of nifty pitching Friday night. The only 
reason he did not pitch longer was a torrential downpour that delayed 
the Rangers' demise and the Yankees' advance for 3 hours 16 minutes. 
Before the rain, after the rain, it did not matter. The Yankees' pitchers 
retired McLemore, Greer, Gonzalez, Clark, Rodriguez. Gonzalez, the 
one in the middle, the heart and soul of the Rangers' lineup, the 
one who drove in 100 runs before the All-Star Game break, battered 
the Yankees in the division series in 1996. He hit five home runs, 
drove in nine runs, batted .438. In this division series, other than 
his second-game double (he scored THE run), he batted the ball out 
of the infield twice. ``The pitchers throw much better in this series,'' 
he said, clearly pained by the developments. ``They throw great. Great 
location. When a great pitching staff throws great, you don't have 
a chance to win ball games. They throw good; they throw in, out, low. 
In the playoffs, they throw more curves, throw in, throw out, use 
the corners a lot, throw a lot of slow pitches.'' Greer said the Yankees' 
pitchers were often ahead in the count. ``That, in turn, makes you 
widen your zone,'' he added. ``It makes you swing the bat, and that 
makes it a lot tougher when you're not in a hitter's count.'' Melvin, 
whose late July trades put the Rangers in the playoffs, said he had 
not seen any team pitch the Rangers as effectively for three consecutive 
games. ``From top to bottom they did a pretty good job pitching our 
guys,'' he said. ``In the third game we still weren't making quality 
contact.'' Yes, McLemore said, but the Yankees can be beaten. ``But 
these three nights weren't the nights,'' he added.
