Responding to years of public complaints, District of Columbia officials 
have acknowledged that parking-enforcement workers often felt that 
they had to rely on predatory, aggressive measures to meet quotas 
for writing tickets. In an effort to improve the image of the city 
and of its employees, the Department of Public Works has announced 
a new policy to develop what Cellerino Bernardino, the director of 
public works, termed ``a more customer-focused work force.'' Under 
the new rules, which took effect last month, parking-ticket writers 
will no longer have to reach a quota, and they will be required to 
improve the accuracy and legibility of the tickets they write and 
to reduce response time in dealing with questions about residential 
and commercial parking. They will also take on the role of helping 
pedestrians and motorists with directions. ``We'd like the parking 
control aides to be ambassadors for the city,'' Bernardino said. ``People 
should not have to fear the parking situation in Washington.'' The 
uniformed employees responsible for issuing parking tickets, perennially 
the least popular public works employees in Washington, had been expected 
to write 90 tickets each day during a six-hour shift _ an average 
of one ticket every four minutes. The ticket writers issued 2.1 million 
tickets last year, which resulted in $49 million in fines. ``I think 
the general perception of the public is that parking tickets have 
been used just to generate revenue,'' Bernardino said. ``People thought 
we were trying to balance the budget by writing tickets.'' Ticket 
writers will be required to complete a one-day customer service training 
seminar, officials said. No one questions the fact that Washington 
has a parking problem. About 750,000 cars are registered in the city 
and 850,000 more cars are driven here by commuters each weekday, city 
officials say. But with all this traffic, there are only 15,000 metered 
parking spaces and no municipal parking lots. ``Of all the issues 
I have faced since my arrival here in January, parking has been cited 
universally,'' Camille Barnett, Washington's chief management officer, 
said in a statement. ``It is an obvious problem in need of a solution, 
and I believe we are taking the right steps to fixing it.'' The city 
has also replaced old and vandalized parking meters with high-tech, 
vandalproof models. The $24.9 million, seven-year parking project 
is administered by Lockheed Martin IMS, which must install, maintain 
and collect coins from 15,000 new meters. Lockheed Martin faces financial 
penalties if at least 97 percent of the meters are not working properly 
at any given time. At the end of the contract, the city will own the 
meters outright. The new digital meters will produce about $15 million 
of revenue a year, officials predict. In addition to the new rules 
and parking meters, the Department of Public Works is installing new 
traffic and parking signs to replace those that are missing, faded 
or vandalized. Bernardino, the public works director, said he was 
confident that the parking situation would improve. ``I know people 
won't believe me, but a year from now people will have a much different 
perspective on parking and parking enforcement in our city,'' he said.
