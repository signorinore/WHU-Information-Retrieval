Jerome Dempsey, an actor who worked in theater, film and television, 
died on Aug. 26 at his home in New York. He was 69. The cause was 
heart failure, his family said. A versatile artist who took on a wide 
variety of roles, Dempsey began his career in Toledo, Ohio, his hometown. 
When he came to New York, he joined the Actors Studio and by the 1960s 
had won roles in ``The Deputy,'' ``Spofford'' and ``The Love-Suicide 
at Schofield Barracks,'' among other plays. As a member of the Lincoln 
Center theater company under Jules Irving, he appeared in ``A Cry 
of Players,'' ``King Lear'' and ``The Crucible.'' He also worked with 
the Yale Repertory Theater under Robert Brustein's direction. In 1977, 
Dempsey played Dr. Van Helsing in ``Dracula'' opposite Frank Langella 
in the title role, winning a Drama Desk award for his performance. 
He also appeared in ``Trelawney of the Wells'' with Meryl Streep, 
Mandy Patinkin and John Lithgow, in ``The Threepenny Opera'' with 
Raul Julia and in ``The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' with Betty Buckley, 
Cleo Laine and George Rose. His film credits include ``Network,'' 
``Brewster's Millions'' and ``Tune in Tomorrow.'' Television viewers 
saw him in productions including ``Gore Vidal's Lincoln'' and ``The 
Kennedys of Massachusetts.'' He is survived by a sister, Joan Devers 
of Sylvania, Ohio.
