Lila Katzen, a sculptor whose abstract works have adorned spaces from 
Fordham University's campus at Lincoln Center to the U.S. Consulate 
in Hamburg, Germany, died Sept. 20 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. 
She was 72 and lived in Manhattan. The cause was liver cancer, said 
her husband, Philip. Ms. Katzen was born and raised in Brooklyn. Early 
in life, when she realized she wanted to be a painter, she began studying 
at the Art Students League in Manhattan and later graduated from Cooper 
Union. Ms. Katzen also studied with the abstract painter Hans Hoffman. 
She began her career as a painter and as early as 1955 had a solo 
exhibition at the Baltimore Museum of Art. A decade later she began 
working with plastic, and in 1968 she created a multicolored plastic 
floor with ribbons of black and gold for the Architectural League 
of New York. In 1970, she made a series of light tunnels for the Sao 
Paulo Biennale in Brazil, and in 1988 she was the U.S. representative 
to World Expo '88 in Brisbane, Australia, where she exhibited a 20-foot-high 
sculpture of Cor-Ten steel. Ms. Katzen's work is in the permanent 
collection of museums across the country, including the National Gallery 
of Art, in Washington, the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford and the 
Milwaukee Art Center. Throughout her life Ms. Katzen was a visiting 
professor at schools around the country, including Wichita State University, 
Lehman College in New York and Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield 
Hills. She is survived by her husband, a daughter, Denize, and a son, 
Hal, all of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
