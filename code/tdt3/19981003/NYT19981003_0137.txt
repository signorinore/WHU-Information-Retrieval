Twelve bearded men bow their heads for grace in the dining room of 
a mountaintop monastery. Behind each chair rests a German shepherd, 
each with a placid mien to match its master's. The dogs are never 
far from the monks of New Skete, except during morning and evening 
services. Then the monks greet or close the day with soothing a cappella 
chanting in their hand-built church, made of weathered barn siding 
and topped with an onion dome. The dogs are both companions and livelihood 
to the monks here, who belong to the Orthodox Church in America, an 
offshoot of the Russian Orthodox Church. Over the years, the monks 
have built a reputation for breeding and training exemplary German 
shepherds, sweet-natured and obedient. The fact that the monks care 
for their breeding dogs as if they were pets is emblematic of the 
monks' philosophy. They advocate cuddling and massaging a dog as much 
as possible from the time it is born, and molding the training regime 
to the animal's stages of neurological development. The monks call 
their technique ``inseeing,'' a word as resonant with holiness as 
the incense that billows through their church. ``We learn to think 
the way the dog thinks,'' said Brother Christopher, the primary trainer. 
``We listen to what is needed rather than imposing our will. In that 
way the dogs play a crucial role in our growth and consciousness, 
because only by getting outside of yourself can you find God.'' The 
monks, who came to upstate New York in 1966, found their second vocation 
serendipitously. After building their rustic compound amid the birch 
and pine forests near the Vermont border, they set about finding a 
way to support a contemplative life. Since they lived atop shale cliffs, 
unsuitable for growing crops, the monks raised animals _ chickens, 
goats, and beef and milk cows _ to feed themselves. They earned pin 
money by selling liturgical books, music and icons, since the guests 
who came here on retreat rarely donated enough for room and board. 
Soon they decided to capitalize on their skill with farm animals, 
building a smokehouse and producing fancy meats and cheeses. Later, 
they affiliated with a small order of nuns. This common monastic enterprise 
gradually gave way to the unusual dog-breeding business, which began 
when the monks got a German shepherd as a pet. They found that the 
animal's guileless affection added warmth to their celibate lives, 
so when it died, they replaced it with two others. Soon guests were 
begging for a puppy and the brothers began studying veterinary medicine, 
animal nutrition and breeding techniques. ``One thing led to another,'' 
Brother Mark said. ``There was no grand design that led us down this 
road.'' Each year, the dogs from New Skete grew more popular. Now, 
there is a two-year waiting list for a puppy, which costs $1,000. 
The monks have written two books about their techniques and produced 
a training video. They also train dogs of all breeds, charging $800 
for three weeks of individual obedience instruction. Each monk is 
responsible for one or two breeding dogs, which sleep in the monks' 
cells, join them at meals and wander with them through the russet 
woods during the quiet hour between the end of the workday and the 
evening meal. ``They have become part of our community life,'' Brother 
Mark said. ``And since they reflect our spiritual life, they are our 
ambassadors.'' Not all the monks work with the dogs. Brother David 
runs the smokehouse. Brother Barnabas makes the cheeses and Brother 
Elias the pickled pineapple relish and other condiments. Everyone 
pitches in for the weekly manufacture of sausages. And all come together 
for meals and services. One evening last week, as a cold wind set 
the birches rustling and 17 bells tolled, three visitors joined them. 
One was a dog lover from Rockland County. The others were relatives 
of a resident monk. Candles lighted the dim church. The monks and 
nuns, in robes and sandals, faced each other in two rows. In four-part 
harmony, they chanted Slavic and Byzantine melodies, translated into 
contemporary English. The air was sweet with incense. Across the way, 
in the residence hall, the dogs of New Skete slept.
