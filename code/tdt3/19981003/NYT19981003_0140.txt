It was not a standard airplane banner that caught the eyes of sunbathers 
from Jones Beach to the Hamptons on the Labor Day weekend. Instead 
of hawking suntan lotion or happy hour drinks, the sign read: ``Make 
a Friend in a Very High Place. Marblechurch.org.'' That was the abbreviated 
version of a print and poster advertisement for the Marble Collegiate 
Church that also says: ``Everyone knows it helps having friends in 
high places, and no one's higher than God. So stop by Marble this 
Sunday and make a powerful new friend. Or just strengthen your friendship 
with an old one.'' God's messenger these days is as likely to be a 
Madison Avenue account executive as a missionary. Religious advertisements 
have become savvier, slicker and certainly wittier than the staid 
church announcements found on the religion pages of newspapers. And 
they have turned up in the strangest places. In the past, church ads 
were generally found in magazines and newspapers and on radio broadcasts. 
Now, with the ascendance of a generation of clergy raised on television 
and video, the ads might also appear on the airborne streamer, the 
telephone kiosk, the construction site and the Web page. ``Folks are 
saying, `If we want to reach out to people and we are not out pounding 
on doors, we must do something we haven't done before,'' said Roy 
Lloyd, the broadcast news director for the National Council of Churches, 
who also works in print media. In addition, he continued, ``People 
no longer join a church because that's where their family belonged, 
and denominational loyalty is a thing of the past. Today, people are 
looking for places that coincide with their values or challenge them 
in ways that are appealing. An impression built over time that mainline 
religion is dull and boring and you have to give them a different 
perspective,'' he said. The church is on Fifth Avenue and 29th Street. 
Marble Collegiate's current advertisements, which were introduced 
in summer resort publications like Hamptons magazine and Dan's Paper 
in the Hamptons and The Fire Island Tide, are now running in New York 
magazine, Time Out New York and The Village Voice, and are attached 
to boarded-up construction sites around the city. They will also go 
up on more than 30 telephone kiosks in December. And the airplane 
trailer is scheduled to make another overhead appearance on Oct. 18 
at Giants Stadium, during a New York Giants-Arizona Cardinals game. 
Among the five other messages in the campaign is one proclaiming ``You 
Don't Have to Be a Sinner To Attend Our Church. But It Helps.'' That 
ad and others were meant to counteract the image of church as judge. 
``There is an enormous amount of bad feeling because of the sense 
that you are a sinner, you are wrong,'' said Dr. Arthur Caliandro, 
the church's senior minister. ``That is not what Marble is all about, 
nor, in fact, what true religion is about.'' John Follis, president 
and creative director of Follis/N.Y., the church's ad agency, said, 
``In my 20 years in the business, I have worked on everything from 
Coca-Cola to infant thermometers, but never have I worked on a product 
that does absolutely everything and is free. Advertising Marble Church 
is essentially selling God.'' If so, God is being sold elsewhere as 
well. Last fall, the Church of the Heavenly Rest, the majestic Episcopal 
house of worship at Fifth Avenue and 90th Street, began using similarly 
amusing ads and is now running two campaigns a year geared to subway 
poster display. A typical message: ``Sex Doesn't Mean a Thing.'' In 
smaller type, it continues: ``Neither does race, age, economic status, 
political affiliation. Or whether you believe in God. If you need 
help, you won't be turned down. You've got to start somewhere. Start 
now.'' Paula Paluszek, a senior copywriter for Grey Advertising, and 
a member of the Church of the Heavenly Rest, wrote the copy. ``I didn't 
want them to even remotely look like church ads but to be constructively 
provocative, she said. ``I wanted to combine a New York in-your-face 
challenge with a warm welcome and a promise of Christian hope.'' Actually, 
she continued, she was inspired by Christ himself. ``When he was working 
among the people, he spoke the vernacular of the time and there were 
compelling bold images in his parables,'' she said. ``Some of his 
images were very graphic, and I took a cue from his style in a way. 
I felt that the ads should be part of the fabric of New York City 
life.'' New York is not alone in the phenomenon, which is being taken 
to an extreme in London, where Charles and Maurice Saatchi, the advertising 
tycoons, will open the Saatchi (named for their parents, not themselves) 
Synagogue this month. An ad has already appeared showing a piece of 
gefilte fish with the catch line, ``At our new synagogue, this is 
the only thing which gets rammed down someone's throat.'' Most religious 
institutions are not so brash. The Rev. James Burns, rector of the 
Church of the Heavenly Rest, had a simple goal when he broached the 
idea of the advertising campaign shortly after becoming its spiritual 
leader two years ago. ``I was after two groups of people,'' he said, 
``people not affiliated with any particular church, who slog up the 
subway stairs each day and wonder `Is this all there is?' and parish 
members who might want to rethink what their church and their participation 
in it is about. When people come in who are new to the church, we 
ask, `Did you see the ad?' and about 50 percent say `Oh, yeah.' Then 
we have a job delivering something worth staying for.'' Still the 
church's goal was not primarily to bolster membership. ``We are a 
fairly large church with 1,600 members and are in good financial shape,'' 
said the associate rector, the Rev. Steven Woolley. ``We are not trying 
to bring in members for the sake of growth or to raise money. We are 
trying to feed the spiritual hunger, doing what God told us to do: 
proclaiming the good news.'' Caliandro said he was disturbed by the 
waning assumption that church is a normal part of Sunday. ``Religious 
worship is no longer an expected part of what we do on Sunday,'' he 
said. Citing the lures of ``staying home and washing the car, playing 
golf or reading the Sunday newspaper,'' he said, ``thirty years ago 
there would have been a fourth option. You might want to go and worship, 
but that is no longer in the thinking of people. In New York City, 
there is such intense competition for attention that religious institutions 
need to let people know they are there and have something to offer.''
