Mayor Rudolph Giuliani arrived here Saturday to lend New York City's 
support in rebuilding the hurricane-battered nation. Giuliani flew 
into Las Americas International Airport at 10 a.m. on a twin-engine 
jet from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., then headed into the capital city 
of Santo Domingo, where he met the president of the Dominican Republic, 
Leonel Fernandez. The mayor was accompanied by the New York City police 
commissioner, Howard Safir, and Jerome Hauer, the director of the 
mayor's Office of Emergency Management. Giuliani met privately with 
Fernandez at the presidential palace, where the president described 
the extent of the storm damage for the mayor and detailed the support 
that the nation needed. Giuliani pledged to help. ``As mayor of the 
second-largest Dominican city in the world, we owe this assistance 
to the Dominican people,'' he said at a news conference after the 
meeting. ``The connection between New York and the Dominican Republic 
is very, very strong.'' The mayor later left the presidential palace 
and, traveling in a seven-car motorcade, headed 32 miles west to the 
coastal city of San Pedro de Macoris, in one of the hardest-hit areas. 
He was scheduled to meet there with the family of Sammy Sosa, the 
Chicago Cubs slugger. Sixty-three New York City firefighters, police 
officers and emergency medical technicians have already been deployed 
there to assist in rescue and rebuilding efforts, including repairing 
major damage to the city's main hospital. Giuliani was also scheduled 
to visit Puerto Rico Saturday and survey the damage wrought there 
by Hurricane Georges. Giuliani's visit came as this country struggled 
to rebuild itself 11 days after being battered by the most devastating 
hurricane to strike here in 20 years. The government here estimates 
that more than 500,000 homes were damaged and that more than 500 people 
were injured during the storm. So far, estimates place the number 
of dead at 249 people. ``The devastation and damage is even greater 
than has been able to be reported,'' the mayor said at the news conference. 
Dominican and U.S. officials estimate the cost of the destruction 
to be about $3 billion, or $500 million more than the nation's annual 
operating budget. Giuliani said Saturday that New York had already 
shipped 1 million pounds of food, clothing and water in 12 shipments 
aboard commercial and military aircraft. He said that the city had 
another half-million pounds of provisions to send, but that it had 
limited means for transporting them. He called on commercial airlines 
to make available more cargo space on their planes to help deliver 
the supplies. Giuliani also said he planned to send a team of city 
officials next week to help the Dominican authorities coordinate the 
cleanup effort and restore power to some of the hardest-hit areas. 
He did not provide any additional details. He also said he would call 
on Consolidated Edison for technical support to help restore power 
to some areas here.
