Roddy McDowall, who provoked tears of sadness, sympathy and joy from 
millions of moviegoers for his boyhood roles in ``How Green Was My 
Valley,'' ``Lassie Come Home'' and other film classics of the 1940s, 
died Saturday at his home in Los Angeles. McDowall, who went on to 
become a versatile character actor on screen and on stage, was 70. 
The cause was cancer, said Robert Lantz, a friend. Roddy McDowall's 
unaffected, poignant performances in his first Hollywood films brought 
him instant fame and respect as an actor. In a career that spanned 
more than 60 years, he made 130 movies and appeared in scores of plays 
and television dramas. He also found time to become a skilled photographer 
and to publish five books of his photos. In addition to his work as 
an actor, he was known for the company he kept. He was a friend of 
the famous, beginning with Elizabeth Taylor, with whom he had an extraordinarily 
close relationship. They acted together in ``Lassie'' and also ``Cleopatra,'' 
and became friends for life. Not only did he meet almost every artist 
of stature in movies and theater, but he also photographed most of 
them. Although he was one of Hollywood's great storytellers, McDowall 
never told tales out of school, one key to the longevity of his friendships. 
As he said, ``I'm a great believer in the private existence of public 
figures.'' In a business marked by competitiveness and cold-bloodedness, 
he was known as a man to be trusted. His sense of loyalty could be 
traced back to his earliest years, when he took heart and also a moral 
lesson from those idealistic films that first made his reputation. 
``The experiences as a child inside those movies were a particular 
life enhancement,'' he said. ``The values had great influence in shaping 
my character.'' Along with Ms. Taylor, McDowall grew up in the movies, 
and more than many actors who had been stars as children, he matured 
and maintained his equilibrium about his celebrity. Acting, he said, 
was ``like being a fruit picker _ it's seasonal,'' and no matter how 
popular an actor is, he worries about his next job. His response was 
to keep working, sometimes accepting assignments that were beneath 
his talent, but generally finding something of value in whatever he 
did. He tried not to concern himself with critical reaction. In his 
interview, he said he had once asked Noel Coward how he was able to 
survive rejection and vilification by the critics. Assuming a crisp 
Coward voice, he recalled the response: ``It's perfectly simple. They're 
wrrrong.'' He loved movies and was an assiduous collector, with a 
large library of films, tapes and memorabilia, including still photographs 
and autographs. His knowledge of the business was so encylopedic that 
if he so desired, he could have been a film historian. In his own 
private way, he was an historian, and among his many cinematic activities, 
he was actively engaged in the film preservation movement. ``My life 
has been absolutely demented by the moving image,'' he said. ``I think 
movies must be preserved, because they're such an important part of 
our heritage. They have clocked absurdities and monitored style and 
have offered a moving account of 100 years, some of it fanciful, some 
of it accurate.'' He regretted that he was too young to have been 
alive at ``day one'' of the movies when audiences were first transported 
into a world of the imagination. As he said, ``I would have loved 
to have been part of the formation of this great art form, which nobody 
knew was an art form, except Lillian Gish.'' Roderick McDowall was 
born in London on Sept. 17, 1928. His father was in the merchant marine 
and his mother, who had lived in the United States as a child, had 
always wanted to act in the movies. By the age of 5, he was enrolled 
in elocution classes. Two years later, guided by his mother, he was 
acting in his first movie, ``Murder in the Family.'' In that English 
mystery, he played the brother of two young actresses, Jessica Tandy 
and Glynis Johns. Encouraged by his mother, he appeared in more than 
20 movies, but because he was under 14, the age allowed under a child 
labor law, he had to be smuggled into film studios hiding on the floor 
of a car. With the outbreak of World War II, he came to the United 
States with his mother and his sister. Within several weeks of his 
arrival he did a screen test for ``How Green Was My Valley.'' Lew 
Schreiber, the casting director at 20th Century Fox, disliked him 
because he was not, in the actor's words, ``cute and adorable'' in 
the Hollywood tradition. When the test came on the screen, Schreiber 
put his hands over the projector, and said to William Wyler, ``You 
don't want to see this kid.'' But Wyler, who was scheduled to direct 
the film, insisted on seeing him, and hired the young English actor. 
The movie was momentarily shelved, but young Roddy took time out to 
act in Fritz Lang's ``Man Hunt.''2 wds Then then John Ford decided 
he wanted to direct ``How Green Was My Valley'' and persuaded Darryl 
F. Zanuck to go ahead with the project. Ford kept the boy in the cast, 
and he was soon acting alongside Walter Pidgeon, Maureen O'Hara and 
Donald Crisp. As Huw, the youngest member of a Welsh coal-mining family 
confronting tragedy, he was a splendid combination of stoicism and 
sensitivity. The movie won five Academy Awards, including one as best 
picture of 1941. The child star was quickly in great demand in Hollywood, 
appearing a series of family movies surrounded by horses and dogs 
_ in adaptations of the Mary O'Hara novels ``My Friend Flicka'' and 
its sequel ``Thunderhead: Son of Flicka,'' and in ``Lassie Come Home,'' 
in which he played Lassie's loving master and Ms. Taylor played a 
supporting role. He loved Lassie the collie and disliked Flicka the 
horse. ``There were a lot of Flickas,'' he said, and one of them stepped 
on his foot. Although the original Lassie had doubles, there was, 
he said, ``only one Lassie, who was an extraordinary dog.'' He always 
rated ``How Green Was My Valley'' and ``Lassie Come Home'' very high, 
along with another, personal favorite, ``The White Cliffs of Dover,'' 
in which he fulfilled one of his dreams by acting with Irene Dunne. 
In 1955 he did three plays, ``The Doctor's Dilemma'' at the Phoenix 
Theater, ``The Tempest'' at Stratford (he played Ariel to Raymond 
Massey's Prospero) and ``No Time for Sergeants'' on Broadway. Often 
he had to fight typecasting. After playing a Southern soldier in ``No 
Time for Sergeants,'' he had difficulty getting roles as Englishmen. 
After acting in ``Compulsion'' on Broadway, he was typed as a psychopath. 
That was followed by ``Look after Lulu,'' ``The Fighting Cock'' and 
the stage musical ``Camelot,'' in which he played Mordred. He also 
acted on television, and after about five years he returned to the 
movies, eventually acting in movies as varied as Orson Welles' production 
of ``Macbeth'' (he played Malcolm both on stage and on screen), ``Cleopatra'' 
(he played Octavian) and the ``Planet of the Apes'' series of films. 
His other films included ``The Subterraneans,'' ``The Longest Day,'' 
``The Loved One,'' ``Lord Love a Duck,'' ``Evil Under the Sun,'' ``Fright 
Night,'' ``Dead of Winter,'' ``Last Summer in the Hamptons'' and ``The 
Grass Harp.'' At one point, the actor who had once played such warm-hearted, 
well-behaved children was in demand to play villains. As a collector 
of performances, he was outspoken about such favorites as Laurette 
Taylor and Bette Davis and also about actors who were trapped by their 
stardom. ``Celebrity sometimes is the most dangerous component in 
the continuance of a career,'' he said. ``Certain people are wildly 
talented but their legend becomes the currency in the marketplace.'' 
Among those underrated actors he named Mae West, Jean Harlow, Alice 
Faye, Alan Ladd and Tuesday Weld. Last year, he was back on stage 
in New York as Scrooge in the musical version of ``A Christmas Carol,'' 
a role of the greatest distance from him and from the character of 
Huw in ``How Green Was My Valley,'' but one that he approached with 
his customary diligence. As always, he looked incredibly young _ until 
makeup transformed him into Dickens' elderly miser. He gave an assured 
performance as the centerpiece of an otherwise overblown production. 
He is survived by his sister Virginia, who lives at the Actors Home 
in Los Angeles, where McDowall often visited elderly actors. Although 
Roddy McDowall never turned his back on his childhood acting, it also 
became something to overcome. It was, he said, a ``demon walking with 
you.'' He added, ``My whole life I've been trying to prove I'm not 
just yesterday.'' The fact is he had to keep reinventing himself in 
his many guises as an actor. But as a student of film he also knew 
that yesterday's treasure, like ``How Green Was My Valley'' and ``Lassie 
Come Home,'' was eternal. Because of all his personal attachments 
and his memories connected with those films, he had difficulty watching 
them again. In common with other moviegoers, he would weep at the 
grief of the little boy on screen.
