The decline of the Downtown Athletic Club has been mirrored at private 
clubs across New York City, many of which have been forced to close 
in recent years by changing fashions, economics and their own inefficiency. 
``About four or five years ago, we drew up a list of 25 clubs that 
had gone out of business,'' said Dan Condon of Condon, O'Meara, McGinty 
and Donnelly, an accounting firm that specializes in clubs. ``And 
there were only about 60 private clubs in New York in 1970.'' Dutton 
and others said that the hardest hit have been clubs in lower Manhattan, 
an area that lost many businesses in the late 1980s, and smaller clubs 
that lack gyms or private rooms where members can stay overnight. 
There are signs that things have bottomed out, Condon said: Club membership 
has inched up by 2 percent to 3 percent in each of the last two years. 
But that is too late for the City Midday, Drug and Chemical Club at 
140 Broadway, which ceased operations in December 1997. The original 
City Midday Club was founded in 1901. ``There was a decline in membership,'' 
said Leonard Dome, a lawyer who is overseeing the club's demise. ``Lifestyles 
changed.'' The clubs that have survived, Condon said, have done so 
by updating their menus, renovating their buildings, and easing up 
on dress codes and old attitudes. In the late 1980s, for example, 
the situation began to look rather grim at the Down Town Association, 
a club on Pine Street in lower Manhattan that dates from 1860. Membership 
had fallen from around 1,100 in the mid-1980s to below 500 in 1989. 
But the current president, Mark Altherr, said the club had rebounded 
somewhat from those dark days. Today, membership has inched up to 
about 580. ``We renovated the building,'' he said. ``We brought in 
new management and upgraded the food.'' Alan Dutton, the president 
of the local chapter of the Club Managers Association of America and 
the general manager of the Yale Club, on Vanderbilt Avenue in midtown 
Manhattan, said that other clubs were getting the message. ``They 
have been improving the rooms, adding fitness equipment and bringing 
in creative cuisine,'' he said. ``The stuffy old club doesn't make 
it anymore.''
