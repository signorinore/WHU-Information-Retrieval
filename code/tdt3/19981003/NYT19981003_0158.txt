Warning that Democrats in the U.S. Senate were ``perilously close'' 
to losing even minimal influence over that body's deliberations, Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan on Saturday urged the election of Rep. Charles 
Schumer, saying he would help block the passage of ``radical, reactionary 
legislation.'' In a rare foray into a New York state campaign, Moynihan 
went to the house where Schumer grew up in Flatbush, Brooklyn, to 
hold a news conference and voice his support for the congressman, 
the Democratic candidate for the Senate seat held by Alfonse M. D'Amato. 
Moynihan, 71, looking grim as he framed the emerging consensus among 
Democrats in Washington, warned that the party was in danger of dropping 
below its 45-seat minority _ and, in fact, might emerge from the November 
election with less than the 40 votes it needs to sustain a filibuster. 
``We are going to go perilously close to a point where we can't use 
a blocking 40 votes against radical, reactionary legislation,'' Moynihan 
said. ``The more, then, do we need a Chuck Schumer, who will not be 
there just to vote, but to organize.'' In most cases, the endorsement 
by a Democratic senator of a Democratic candidate for Senate would 
be less than surprising. But this case is noteworthy because Moynihan 
has long enjoyed cordial relations with D'Amato _ whose name he did 
not mention once on Saturday _ and because Moynihan has frequently 
been criticized for failing to tend to the parochial needs of the 
Democratic Party and its candidates in New York. Therefore, there 
was much curiosity, even among Schumer's supporters, over whether 
Moynihan would venture an opinion on D'Amato's campaign advertisements 
attacking Schumer as a Brooklyn liberal who is out of touch with the 
interests of voters upstate, where Moynihan lives. As it turned out, 
Moynihan never answered those questions. As the news conference proceeded, 
the senator looked increasingly flushed. When Moynihan was asked if 
he considered D'Amato's campaign divisive, the senator appeared confused 
and his speech was halting. ``I'm going to have to go over there and 
sit down for a minute,'' Moynihan said. ``I have a fever.'' Schumer, 
who was watching Moynihan's difficulties with evident concern, said, 
``The senator had a cold and wasn't going to come today and then decided 
to come.'' Then, assisted by Schumer and aides, Moynihan walked stiffly 
over to a folding chair in the back of the postage stamp of a yard 
where Schumer grew up and tried unsuccessfully to sit down. ``Would 
you mind if I just went off to the car?'' Moynihan inquired. ``You 
can answer all those questions. I've got the damnedest flu.'' Moynihan 
than left. Moynihan called from Washington later in the day, saying 
that he had been battling a flu for much of the last three days and 
had decided to try to return home to recuperate. In response to a 
question, Moynihan said he did not think that D'Amato had been doing 
anything unfair _ or, for that matter, unusual _ in stoking regional 
divisions. ``It's a perfectly normal pattern of political statement,'' 
Moynihan said. ``It's the way things are done. George Washington Plunkett 
once said, `New York City is pie for the hayseeds.' That kind of perception 
goes back and forth. In upstate, you'll find the opposite.'' Moynihan 
declined to comment on Schumer's advertisements, which accuse D'Amato 
of lying. ``I don't want to get near that subject,'' Moynihan said. 
``I'm not aware of it. As you might be aware, we have a lot going 
on down there.'' And finally, Moynihan declined to offer any critical 
words about Schumer's opponents. ``I'm for Schumer,'' he said, before 
ending the conversation. Moynihan could help Schumer by rebutting 
D'Amato's portrayal of Schumer. Moynihan has also endorsed Peter Vallone, 
the New York City Council speaker, in the race for governor, and has 
campaigned for him at times. Schumer's campaign manager, Josh Isay, 
said he hoped that the senator would do the same thing for Schumer. 
Schumer's aides were clearly unsettled by Saturday's news conference. 
Nonetheless, they portrayed Moynihan's endorsement as a boost for 
Schumer, noting that in 1992, the senator did not endorse D'Amato's 
Democratic rival, Robert Abrams, until Oct. 19. Moynihan as a rule 
refrains from criticizing D'Amato, and the two frequently attend events 
together that serve them both well politically. ( Moynihan and Schumer 
are to appear at a news conference on acid rain in Washington on Tuesday.) 
D'Amato's aides said they were not worried about the endorsement and 
quickly came up with examples in which Moynihan had been equally nice 
to D'Amato. ``Senator Moynihan has been quoted as saying that Senator 
D'Amato is passionate and detailed in his work for New York state,'' 
said Harvey Valentine, D'Amato's campaign spokesman. ``It's more extraordinary 
that a Democratic leader like Senator Moynihan would have this high 
praise for Al D'Amato than a perfunctory endorsement for Chuck Schumer.'' 
Even as he avoided mentioning D'Amato, Moynihan offered warm words 
for the representative from Brooklyn. He credited him for sponsoring 
legislation to restrict the spread of guns. He noted, approvingly, 
that Schumer was one of the Democrats who voted for legislation that 
used tax increases and spending cuts to eliminate the deficit. Moynihan 
said he and Schumer had made a practice of having dinner together 
once a month for 20 years. ``He is an extraordinary legislator with 
an unequalled record of achievements in the House of Representatives,'' 
he said.
