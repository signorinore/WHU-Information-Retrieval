He was supposed to be the secret weapon in the New York Giants' passing 
attack this season, but he has been kept in hiding so well that some 
fans may have forgotten he was on the team. Sooner rather than later, 
it's likely that the Giants rookie wide receiver Joe Jurevicius will 
get another chance to show why the team made him its second-round 
draft pick out of Penn State this spring. The mystery is why he hasn't 
seen more action already. The 6-foot-5-inch Jurevicius was the team 
leader during the preseason in every receiving category _ passing 
yards (218), average gain per catch (27.3), receptions (8) and longest 
gain (59) _ but since the second quarter of the opening game of the 
regular season, he has barely stepped onto the playing field except 
for his role on special teams. With his size and surprisingly good 
downfield speed, Jurevicius was supposed to be the big-target wide 
receiver the Giants desperately need on a receiving corps that lacked 
height. And he immediately impressed his coaches in summer training 
camp as a polished, poised receiver with good hands. But in the 14 
quarters since he caught a 22-yard pass in the second quarter of the 
Giants' opener against Washington, Jurevicius has had two balls thrown 
his way _ both were incomplete passes during garbage time at the end 
of a Giants defeat. Last week, in the Giants' victory at San Diego, 
Jurevicius didn't get onto the field for a single play from scrimmage. 
The week before, he was in on just a few plays. When the team has 
gone to four-wide-receiver sets, Jurevicius has been the odd man out. 
He is the fifth receiver on a team that dresses five receivers. Greg 
Comella, an undrafted rookie fullback, has had twice as many balls 
thrown his way as Jurevicius has. Comella has caught one pass for 
3 yards. David Patten, the team's fourth receiver, has had three times 
as many balls thrown his way and has one reception for 5 yards. It 
would be a natural suspicion _ this being a team sport with lots of 
strict rules, regulations and a complex set of plays _ that Jurevicius 
has got on someone's bad side, that maybe he missed a meeting or a 
curfew, or hasn't sufficiently learned the offense. Not so, said his 
coaches. ``The biggest reason he hasn't been out there is he's playing 
behind Chris Calloway,'' Giants coach Jim Fassel said, referring to 
the team's most experienced and reliable receiver, whose 20 receptions 
tie him for the team lead with Ike Hilliard. ``It's nothing Joe hasn't 
done. Sometimes it's just hard to get on the field when the guy in 
front of you is such a good player. But you'll see Joe again.'' Jurevicius, 
team officials said, has also been slowed by a toe injury sustained 
in the final preseason game and by some other foot ailments, although 
he has been healthy enough to play on special teams. The biggest factor, 
the coaches have said, is that the Giants have some depth at wide 
receiver for a change. ``Lately, for Joe to play we're taking somebody 
off the field who's been playing pretty good,'' the Giants' receivers 
coach, Jimmy Robinson, said. ``If Calloway comes out, you're taking 
out a guy who has touchdowns in three of the four games we've played. 
And Amani Toomer has emerged as the third receiver. He has caught 
six balls, and two of them were for touchdowns. ``It's a tough thing 
because we've got some very capable people, Joe being one of them. 
But we're not displeased with him. His time will come.'' Jurevicius 
does not seem upset by his lack of playing time. ``Let's wait and 
see,'' he said, perhaps knowing his role could increase in Sunday's 
game with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. ``I'm confident they believe in 
my abilities or they wouldn't have drafted me where they did. My job 
on this team right now is on special teams.'' Unintentionally, it 
is on the punt team that Jurevicius has drawn the most notice. He 
has twice been called for 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. 
The first was for a hardly perceptible shove of an opponent at or 
after the whistle, and the second for supposedly blocking after the 
whistle. The penalties were so borderline in the view of the Giants 
coaches that they didn't reprimand Jurevicius for them. ``The coaches 
didn't say a thing,'' said Jurevicius, whose greatest contribution 
to the Giants this season might be as a tall receiver when the offense 
is near the goal line. ``That's just one of those things. Maybe they're 
just picking on the rookie.'' Someone besides the referees could be 
singling out Jurevicius in games to come. At 6-5 and 230 pounds, he's 
too big to keep hidden for long.
