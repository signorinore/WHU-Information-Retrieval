Who could blame Sammy Sosa for not wanting this season to end? He 
hit a remarkable 66 home runs, leading the Chicago Cubs to the post-season 
for the first time since 1989. He battled Mark McGwire with class 
during a historic home run race that mesmerized the sports world. 
And during his joyous ride, Sosa has been embraced by fans everywhere, 
as he was in Atlanta on Wednesday and Thursday, when he received a 
standing ovation on both days before his first at-bat. Sosa has refused 
to believe he has come this far, and accomplished this much, only 
to see the Cubs eliminated by the Atlanta Braves. So as he prepared 
for Saturday night's Game 3, with the Cubs trailing 2-0 in the three-of-five-game 
series, Sosa sounded more confident than concerned. ``We are probably 
going to come back and win three in a row,'' said Sosa, looking forward 
to swinging his bat Saturday in front of the home faithful at Wrigley 
Field. ``We've done it before, and we are probably going to do it 
again.'' No matter what Sosa did on Saturday night, he knew Wrigley 
would be rocking with Cubs fans, eager to see their team extend its 
season at least another day. Chicago was 51-31 at home this year, 
and the Cubs hoped the atmosphere created by their supporters would 
help shift momentum their way. Sosa gets an adrenaline rush at Wrigley 
just by hearing people react when he steps onto the field. The love 
affair between Sosa and Cubs fans is strong, and instead of being 
flustered by spending a season in the spotlight, Sosa has basked in 
the experience. ``It's been the most beautiful thing I've ever seen 
in my life in Chicago,'' said Sosa. ``It has been unbelievable. I 
have a lot of respect for the fans in Chicago. They have always been 
there for us.'' But the Cubs, who have not won a World Series since 
1908, entered Saturday's game on the verge of falling short again. 
And how Sosa fared Saturday will probably go a long way toward determining 
Chicago's fate. In the first two games of the series at Turner Field, 
Sosa went 2 for 7 with a double and a single, but he was still looking 
for his first rbi or home run. Blame the Braves' excellent pitching, 
and their refusal to give Sosa much to hit until his teammates prove 
they can pick up the slack. Chicago entered Saturday night's game 
batting .150 in the series, and key players like Mark Grace (0 for 
8), Gary Gaetti (0 for 7), and Lance Johnson (1 for 8) were all struggling. 
Meanwhile, the Cubs faced another potentially frustrating experience 
Saturday against Greg Maddux, Atlanta's starter and four-time Cy Young 
Award winner. Sosa was a career .290 hitter against Maddux (9 for 
31) entering Saturday's game, but Maddux has handled Gaetti (.235), 
Grace (.222) and Johnson (.200) in the past. The stage was set for 
another possible pitchers' duel, with the Cubs relying on their 21-year-old 
rookie phenom, Kerry Wood, to help keep their season alive. The last 
time Wood faced the Braves, on July 21, he outpitched Maddux and led 
Chicago to a 3-0 victory, striking out 11 batters in 7 2/3 innings. 
But Wood has not pitched since Aug. 31, sidelined by a sore elbow, 
and nobody knew if he would have the stamina or control to pitch effectively 
on a chilly night after a long layoff. Sosa, however, liked the idea 
of having Wood on the mound. ``Kerry Wood is like Randy Johnson of 
the Astros,'' said Sosa. ``We have a lot of confidence in Kerry. He's 
going to be ready.'' But the Cubs were not ready for the season to 
end, and Sosa entered Saturday night's game still with visions of 
playing in the World Series. Considering Chicago's 2-0 deficit, a 
World Series was a long shot for the Cubs. But who believed Sosa would 
hit 66 home runs when the season started? Who believed that he would 
drive in 158 runs? Who believed he would be the leading candidate 
for the Most Valuable Player Award? Until the series was over, Sosa 
planned to keep swinging. There would be plenty of time later to savor 
the memories. ``I've got everything on video,'' said Sosa. ``After 
the year's over, I'll be at home relaxing and I will play the tape. 
And believe me, I'm going to jump.''
