Organizing a household almost always involves one crucial word: clutter. 
``Most people I deal with have too much stuff,'' said Linda Rothschild, 
head of Cross It Off Your List, a professional organizer and moving 
consultant in Manhattan. ``And most people with too much stuff have 
their stuff in all the wrong places.'' Usually, she said, ``stuff'' 
falls into three categories: useful things that are available when 
needed; useful things that are lost; and lost things that wouldn't 
be useful even if found. The latter two, she said, constitute clutter. 
``Some people have a tremendous resistance to getting rid of things,'' 
Ms. Rothschild said. ``I'm convinced that a lot of people don't even 
know what they really have. And when you let things go like that for 
a while, you end up with one overwhelming mess.'' The first strategy 
for dealing with household clutter, Ms. Rothschild said, is to assess 
what you have in terms of what you need. ``Are you really going to 
read that book or magazine again?'' she said, addressing one of clutter's 
most fertile areas: printed material. ``And do you really need to 
keep that ratty old sweater you got from your first boyfriend?'' The 
best way to deal with printed material, she said, is to get a file 
cabinet and use it judiciously. ``Papers need a place to live,'' she 
said. ``So every home needs a file cabinet.'' Having a specific place 
to store papers and documents, she said, makes a person address clutter's 
primary cause: indecision. Either a piece of paper is important enough 
to keep or it isn't. If it is, file it; if it isn't, put it in the 
recycling bin. When organizing closets, Ms. Rothschild said, the thing 
to do after getting rid of that ratty old sweater is to use every 
inch. ``Most people don't use all their storage space properly,'' 
she said, adding that while most clothes closets have a shelf installed 
over the hanger bar, many have a lot unused space between that shelf 
and the ceiling. ``Just adding a few more shelves and using them to 
store off-season clothes should free up a lot of room,'' she said. 
``Just make sure that what you're putting there is really something 
you're going to wear next summer.'' And anything that hasn't been 
worn for more than a year or so, Ms. Rothschild said, would probably 
look better on someone else. ``Give it to the Salvation Army,'' she 
said. ``That way you get rid of something you don't need and feel 
good about it at the same time.'' Pat Moore, a professional organizer 
in Richmond, Va., said that a significant cause of clutter is old 
shoes. ``I've had clients with dozens and dozens of shoes,'' Ms. Moore 
said, adding that in most cases, it is unlikely that shoes in the 
back of a bedroom closet will ever come in contact with feet again, 
unless they are donated to charity. For those with children whose 
shoes can end up virtually anywhere, Ms. Moore said, it is sometimes 
useful to put a small bookcase near the front door for quick storage. 
A curtain or piece of decorative fabric draped across the front can 
camouflage the function when company arrives. Another reason people 
find themselves with messy houses is that they don't stop clutter 
before it begins. ``I call it the psychology of clutter,'' Ms. Moore 
said. ``If putting something away properly is not comfortable, you 
won't put it away.'' For example, she said, many people can't understand 
why someone would insist on hanging coats or jackets on the back of 
a chair rather than in a nearby closet. ``That's because the closet 
is probably packed with wire hangers,'' she said, adding that since 
it is difficult if not impossible to extricate one wire hanger from 
a jumble, it becomes easier and more comfortable to use the back of 
a chair. So simply discarding unnecessary hangers and opening up space 
in a cluttered cabinet goes a long way toward keeping chairs available 
for sitting. Stephanie Denton, the owner of Denton &AMP; Co., an organizing 
service in Cincinnati, said that people who tend to let clutter get 
the upper hand should try to figure out why. ``Organization has both 
mental and physical sides,'' Ms. Denton said. ``Sometimes, being messy 
is just a lack of discipline. Other times, it's a lack of physical 
space.'' Generally, she said, the latter problem must be addressed 
first; even the most disciplined individuals need places to put things. 
``You have to be creative,'' she said. ``There is storage space all 
over the house,'' she said, ``if you just look for it'' _ over desks 
in dens and over dressers in bedrooms, for example. ``And the space 
in the closet beneath your shirts is dead air until you put a wire 
rack or shelf under it,'' she said. ``And don't forget that those 
behind-the-door shoe racks really do work, particularly when you're 
pressed for space.'' Attics, basements and garages, Ms. Denton said, 
should also be exploited, albeit cautiously. ``It's easy for these 
areas to become storage graveyards,'' she said, pointing out that 
see-through plastic storage containers are worth the investment since 
they make it easy to find stored items. At very least, she said, the 
content of all boxes should be marked clearly on the outside. Storing 
things in unmarked boxes, she said, can increase clutter if it becomes 
necessary to buy a duplicate because the original can't be found. 
``Some people put things in boxes and never see them again,'' Ms. 
Denton said. Finally, she said, once the physical space has been optimized, 
the more subtle mental component remains. ``If you don't have a designated 
place for every object, you end up thinking, `Now where is the perfect 
place to put this?''' Ms. Denton said. ``And if you can't think of 
the perfect place right away, you end up putting it just about anywhere 
until later. And later never comes.'' Ms. Denton, who is on the board 
of the National Association of Professional Organizers, a trade association 
based in Cincinnati, said that those who need professional help _ 
which can cost anywhere from $50 to $200 an hour _ can call the organization 
at (512) 206-0151 for a referral.
