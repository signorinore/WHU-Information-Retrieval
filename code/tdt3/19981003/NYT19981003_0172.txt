One minute 25 seconds before the Ohio State band marched on the field 
at halftime and 2:16 after it left was all the time it took for the 
top-ranked Buckeyes to turn a tense, well-played football game into 
a 28-9 drubbing of Penn State on Saturday. In that brief span, Ohio 
State converted a crucial fourth down, blocked a punt, scored two 
touchdowns and lost its quarterback coach, Tim Salem, to a bloody 
hand. In testimony to how tense the first half was, Salem shattered 
the window of the press box in a moment of cathartic celebration after 
his protege, Joe Germaine, found Michael Wiley for a touchdown pass 
with 23 seconds remaining in the first half. Suddenly a sluggish Buckeye 
team had a 14-3 halftime lead that it didn't really deserve. The good 
tidings continued when Ohio State returned for the third quarter. 
In the play that turned a classic game _ played before a rain-soaked 
crowd of 93,479 at Ohio Stadium _ into another drumming of a Top 25 
team, senior safety Percy King blasted through the Nittany Lion line 
and blocked Pat Pidgeon's punt. Worse, Pidgeon was punting from the 
end zone, and the Buckeyes' Joe Cooper flopped on the ball as Ohio 
State took a 21-3 lead. It was Germaine who was responsible for engineering 
the Buckeye offense's only first-half score. He ran the two-minute 
offense to perfection as time wound down on the first half. Ahead 
by 7-3, Ohio State took over at its own 49-yard line with 1:48 left 
in the half. The senior quarterback completed passes of 17 and 13 
yards to Penn State's 33. But as it had all day, the Nittany Lion 
defense stiffened to force a fourth-and-9. The Buckeyes' kicker, Dan 
Stultz, had missed from 40 yards in the first quarter and had his 
50-yard attempt blocked earlier in the second quarter. So coach John 
Cooper kept the ball in Germaine's hands, where it had paid off all 
afternoon. In the first half alone, Germaine kept drives alive _ twice 
by passing, on third-and-6 and third-and-9, and once by scrambling 
to convert a third-and-19. Taking a quick drop, Germaine found Dee 
Miller cutting across the middle of the field for an 11-yard gain 
and crucial first down. Three plays later, this time facing third-and-8, 
Germaine found Wiley, who streaked past the overmatched linebacker 
Mac Morrison, to catch a bullet at the goal line.
