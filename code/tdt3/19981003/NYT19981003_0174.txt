The former chief executive of Siemens AG, Karlheinz Kaske, died Sept. 
27 after a long illness, the company reported from Munich. He was 
70. Kaske, head of Siemens from 1981 until 1992, oversaw the growth 
of the German company into a global electronics and engineering giant 
during the 1980s. He masterminded the company's expansion overseas, 
particularly in the United States and East Asia, and strengthened 
its position in various fields, especially microelectronics. He also 
formed an alliance with the chip makers IBM and Toshiba, and signed 
a contract to cooperate with China in the field of electronics. Kaske 
was also responsible for the acquisition of the computer maker Nixdorf 
in 1990 and the takeover, together with General Electric Co. of Britain, 
of the Plessey Company PLC, in 1989. Born in 1928 in Essen, Germany, 
Kaske joined Siemens &AMP; Halske AG, as the company was then called, 
in 1950. He rose to join the management board in 1975 and six years 
later was named chairman. The acquisitions and a revamping of Siemens 
increased annual profits to 2 billion Deutsche marks ($1.19 billion 
at current exchange rates) when Kaske served as chairman. Sales during 
those years more than doubled, from 35 billion marks ($21 billion) 
to 79 billion marks ($47.2 billion). The number of employees rose 
to 413,000, from 338,000. After his retirement from Siemens, Kaske 
continued to serve on the boards of Eastman Kodak Co., Linde AG and 
MAN AG. In addition, he served on the German League of Science Foundations, 
the board of trustees of Munich University and as chairman of the 
administration board of Deutsches Museum in Munich.
