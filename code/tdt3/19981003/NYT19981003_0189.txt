Miami pulverized Rutgers 53-17 Saturday, and the margin might have 
been greater had the Hurricanes had their minds completely on the 
game from the start. Miami has drawn votes in the national polls, 
although not enough to push it into the top 25. Rutgers had lost 16 
straight games to Division I-A opponents until it upset Army last 
Saturday. Miami was a four-touchdown favorite in this Big East game, 
but there was a danger signal: Its next two opponents are Florida 
State and West Virginia, both nationally ranked. ``It's not going 
to take a crazy game plan to beat Rutgers,'' Scott Covington, Miami's 
senior quarterback, said this week. ``A week like this is really good 
for us because we can work on stuff that's not necessarily for this 
game, but for later games.'' College football coaches hate to hear 
their players talk like that, because the divided attention leaves 
their teams ripe for an upset. And for much of the first half Saturday, 
Miami left the door open. ``We played a somewhat poor first half,'' 
said Butch Davis, the Miami coach. But Rutgers could not match Miami's 
talent or its big-play capabilities, and when the Hurricanes turned 
on the switch, they overwhelmed the Scarlet Knights. At least Miami 
was quick and merciful once it got going. Its scoring drives took 
a total of only 8 minutes 28 seconds, and its 13-3 halftime lead ballooned 
with four touchdowns in the third quarter and two in the fourth. Three 
touchdowns came in a four-minute span on passes of 12, 28 and 71 yards 
from Covington to Santana Moss, the sophomore flanker. Midway through 
the first quarter, the 21,419 spectators at Rutgers Stadium watched 
Rutgers line up for what appeared to be a 35-yard field-goal attempt. 
But it was a fake, and Rutgers passed instead, incomplete. After that, 
it was all Miami, whose record climbed to 3-1. Rutgers dropped to 
2-3. Miami had the ball for only 20:51, but it gained 569 yards, 398 
by passing. Covington completed 21-of-30 passes for 312 yards, and 
Edgerrin James, the junior tailback, carried 15 times for 131 yards 
and two touchdowns. Moss caught six passes for 146 yards and is averaging 
22.5 yards a catch this year. Middle linebacker Aaron Brady and cornerback 
Reggie Stephens, both seniors and backbones of the Scarlet Knight 
defense, said Miami attacked where Rutgers was vulnerable. ``They 
really took advantage of our young players at the corners,'' Brady 
said. Stephens added: ``I told our young guys that if the other team 
makes big plays, you have to let it go. This is the best experience 
they're going to get.'' Covington's fourth-quarter relief pitcher, 
Kenny Kelly, threw two passes and completed both, one for 56 yards 
to set up a touchdown and the next for 30 yards and a touchdown. That 
did not thrill Rutgers. ``I don't like the way they ran up the score,'' 
said Bill Powell, the Rutgers flanker. Rutgers had good offensive 
numbers _ 452 yards from scrimmage, 177 yard rushing, 27 first downs. 
But Mike McMahon's passing (17-of-33 for 275 yards) and Dennis Thomas' 
rushing (19 for 88 yards) could not overcome poor field position. 
And as Coach Terry Shea of Rutgers said, ``I don't think we're going 
to beat anybody running the football.'' Rutgers has given up 40 or 
more points in 12 of its last 19 games. Still, the Scarlet Knights 
play hard and remain upbeat. As Thomas said, perhaps too optimistically, 
``I know we can play with any team in the Big East.'' EXTRA POINTS: 
Gill Ross, a starting outside linebacker for Rutgers, sustained a 
sprain of his left ankle in the second quarter and did not return. 
... This was the seventh game between Miami and Rutgers. Miami has 
won them all. ... At halftime, the Rutgers Football Hall of Fame inducted 
four newcomers _ defensive back Ken Smith (Class of 1981), inside 
linebacker Tyronne Stowe (1987), the late running back Charles Hoyt 
``Bus'' Terrill (1926) and historian Larry Pitt (1939).
