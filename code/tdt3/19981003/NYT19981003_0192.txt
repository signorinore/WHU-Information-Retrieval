Judge Norma Holloway Johnson of the U.S. District Court has reportedly 
appointed an outside expert to assist her inquiry into whether the 
office of the Whitewater independent counsel had illegally leaked 
grand jury evidence about the Lewinsky investigation. The appointment 
was reported Saturday by Associated Press, citing unnamed legal sources 
who said that Ms. Johnson last week secretly ordered the appointment 
of an expert, or special master. Normally, a lawyer or law professor 
would be appointed. The special master probably will review evidence 
submitted by Kenneth Starr to rebut allegations that his office leaked 
information. The special master will report to Ms. Johnson, who will 
decide whether a penalty is required. Charles Bakaly, a spokesman 
for Starr, and David Kendall, one of President Clinton's lawyers, 
declined to comment. Associated Press said its sources were outside 
Starr's and Kendall's offices. It is a violation of federal law for 
prosecutors or their investigators to reveal information being considered 
by a grand jury, but the law is rarely enforced. Rule 6(e) of the 
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure states that prosecutors ``shall 
not disclose matters occurring before the grand jury.'' Violations 
are considered contempt of court and are punishable by fines and even 
prison sentences. But two law professors interviewed in February, 
Gerald E. Lynch of Columbia University and Sara Sun Beale of Duke 
University, said they knew of no instance in which a prosecutor was 
charged with violating the rule. Clinton's lawyers have long complained 
about the leaks. Paul Begala, a senior adviser to Clinton, said in 
February: ``When I see story after story that cites sources close 
to the investigation, I think it's fair enough to call into question 
that someone somewhere is leaking information. And I'm pretty sure 
it's not the president's lawyers.''
