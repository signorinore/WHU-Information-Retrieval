NATIONAL FORECAST Very cool and unsettled weather will prevail from 
the northwestern states to the northern Mississippi Valley as a series 
of fast-moving disturbances circulate around a whirlpool of high-level 
chill over western North America. Onshore winds will promote light 
showers near the northwest coast, while the interior will have breezy 
conditions with variable clouds and few showers. A jet-stream disturbance 
will bring widespread showers and some high-elevation snow from Wyoming 
to the Bitterroot mountains of Idaho and Montana. Periods of rain 
and drizzle will dampen the northern parts of the Plains and Mississippi 
Valley as moist air flowing north from the western Gulf of Mexico 
will be forced to rise over the chilly air in place across the region. 
The steadiest rain is expected from the eastern Dakotas to northern 
Iowa. Meanwhile, a few thunderstorms will erupt in the warmer air 
over the central Mississippi and western Ohio valleys. Most of the 
Southeast will be warm and muggy under the influence of a broad flow 
of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. A cluster of heavy showers associated 
with a tropical disturbance will reach the central Gulf of Mexico 
coast. Farther north, scattered thundershowers will develop, especially 
along the east slopes of the southern Appalachians. The day will begin 
with low clouds and patchy light rain from the southern New England 
coast to the Middle Atlantic States. Gradual drying will develop during 
the middle of the day and the afternoon. High pressure will keep northern 
New England dry and cool with ample sun. FOCUS: Season of Color From 
the middle of September to the end of October, the trees throughout 
the northeastern states typically become a natural palette of brilliant 
color. The usual burst of crimsons and yellows during the period around 
the autumn equinox comes when leaves begin to die, losing their green 
color as the hours of sunshine steadily wane. The most vivid hidden 
pigments are revealed in years when dry, cool weather hastens the 
hibernation of the trees. Sometimes gusty winds and frequent rain 
defoliate trees too soon and dilute the delicate color from the leaves 
that remain.
