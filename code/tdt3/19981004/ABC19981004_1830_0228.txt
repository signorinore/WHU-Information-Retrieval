After ten months of scandal the formal debate over a possible impeachment 
begins tomorrow in the house Judiciary committee. ABC's Tim O'Brien 
is on Capitol Hill. In the same room where 25 years ago a different 
Judiciary committee considered the impeachment of Richard Nixon, history 
is expected to repeat itself. The debate that begins tomorrow, will 
not focus on whether to hold impeachment hearings but rather on the 
scope. We have to go where the evidence takes us, however long it 
takes. Chairman Hyde hopes the hearings will be over by January. But 
as republican colleagues are resisting any effort to impose a formal 
deadline. The problem with putting a artificial time limit, is that 
then we put a time factor ahead of the truth seeking factor. Republicans 
want to leave open the possibility of expanding the inquiry beyond 
the Lewinsky matter. Democrats object. I think that there are republicans 
who are determined to do impeachment but feel the Lewinsky material 
isn't strong enough. And what I'm afraid we will get is impeachment 
in search of a high crime. Relying heavily on the voluminous Starr 
report, the republican's chief counsel will present the committee 
the possible grounds for impeachment. Sources say he will reject, 
modify and may even add to the 11 grounds identified by Kenneth Starr. 
The way the republicans are doing this, they're taking first the vote 
whether we go forward before we've even had a public discussion, which 
we need of what are the standards of impeachment. The committee is 
expected to reject a formal request from the White House that it define 
high crimes and misdemeanors before inquiring into whether President 
Clinton has committed any. Tomorrow's hearing is the first impeachment 
proceeding under the law creating the independent counsel and there 
is uncertainty over how to proceed. Uncertainty likely to make the 
process even longer rather than shorter and even more partisan. Carole? 
Thanks. Tim O'Brien reporting from the capitol.
