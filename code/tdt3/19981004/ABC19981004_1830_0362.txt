The Lewinsky scandal has dominated debate on Capitol Hill since January. 
Now with one week left before a scheduled recess, there is a mountain 
of unfinished business. ABC's John Cochran has that story. President 
Clinton claims republicans are using the scandal as a smoke screen 
to hide the slow pace of legislative action. Well, he would say that 
wouldn't he? Surprisingly, some republicans agree. The Starr report 
has effectively shut down the Congress. No one seemed to notice when 
the Senate killed campaign finance reform. The vote came during the 
three-day period last month when the Starr report was delivered to 
Congress and then made public. I would say that if you don't want 
legislation to pass, this is the year to be in Congress. Because you 
can kill legislation and if you are voting against what the public 
wants, the puic isn't really going to be aware that you did that. 
Since the Lewinsky scandal became public in January, congressional 
initiatives have slowed to a crawl. First tobacco legislation went 
nowhere, then a move to reform managed health care bogged down. Now 
there's a stalemate over what to do with the budget surplus, use for 
tax cuts or keep all of it in reserve to protect social security? 
Big questions. But many in Congress say they are consumed with the 
other big question, to impeach or not to impeach? We didn't come up 
here to be judge and jury on President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. 
That isn't why we ran for Congress. And yet that, I would say, is 
the legacy at the moment. Even without the impeachment controversy, 
Washington might still be mired in stalemate. We have seen it before, 
long before we ever heard of Monica Lewinsky. The difference this 
time is that the public is not paying much attention, which means 
there's not much pressure on Congress to do anything about it. John 
Cochran, ABC News, Capitol Hill.
