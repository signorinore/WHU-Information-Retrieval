The architects of the world economy are brainstorming this weekend 
in Washington, trying to hold off the biggest economic crisis since 
world war ii. They haven't gotten very far. Here is ABC's Bill Redeker. 
All weekend, they've tried to figure out how to rescue the global 
economy. But beyond pledging intensified cooperation, the world's 
top financial officials have yet to come up with any specific proposals, 
certainly not anything economists would welcome. Probably what is 
needed are lower interest rates in the United States, tougher action 
by Japan to improve its banking system and to stimulate growth. The 
only thing they've done so far is issue a lukewarm endorsement of 
President Clinton's plan to reform the international monetary fund 
so that it can intervene earlier in propping up ailing economies. 
We have an obligation not only to others throughout the world but 
to our own economy. 30% of this growth we've enjoyed has come from 
selling things to people overseas who had enough money to buy them. 
So Friday, the president urged Congress to help fund the IMF, asking 
it to release the $18 billion the U.S. has committed. But today, Senate 
majority leader Trent Lott once again said that won't happen until 
the IMF changes. I mean, they urge countries to devalue their currency 
or to raise taxes, the exact wrong thing that you need to be doing 
when a country is in economic difficulty. While the debate over how 
to fix the world economy continues, individual investors looked out 
for themselves this weekend and crowded investment seminars like this 
one in northern Virginia. And when financial advisers talked, people 
listened. The key to investment is live long. So you know, put it 
away now and live long. Good advice because no one is saying that 
a worldwide economic recovery will happen anytime soon. Bill Redeker, 
ABC News, Washington.
