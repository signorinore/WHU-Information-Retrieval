For most Americans, the scope of the problem is just hitting home. 
But U.S. farmers have been feeling it for awhile. In Chicago this 
weekend, the 14th annual farm aid concert to raise money for family 
farms. With the economic crisis in Asia reaching the U.S., the help 
will be more than welcome. ABC's Jane Clayson is in the pacific northwest. 
In the apple orchards of central Washington, growers are forecasting 
a record harvest. But for Randy Smith, that will not translate into 
record profits. I have hopes of breaking even this year. Grower Doug 
Paulie has the same concern. We've seen all the varieties drop in 
price substantially from last year. The Asian economic crisis is affecting 
farmers in the pacific northwest. Asian countries once imported nearly 
half of this region's apple crop. But now they're looking for cheaper, 
lower-quality alternatives. And it's not just apples. The price of 
Washington wheat has dropped to a 21-year low. I've never seen it 
this bad in terms of the export market. At the port of Seattle, imports 
have increased 37% this year. But look at exports -- a 54% drop in 
lumber and wood sales, a 48% drop in crop exports and a 22% decline 
in computers and industrial equipment. We're sort of representative, 
or a microcosm, of the rest of the economy in this country. And that's 
why I think it's worrisome, and we need to pay attention. Beginning 
next week, Washington state apple growers will be trying to get your 
attention. Growers are so worried about the drop in Asian demand that 
with every box of apples they sell, they've levied a tax on themselves 
to pay for an ad campaign promoting apples in the United States. It's 
a $23 million effort. Washington apples -- they're as good as you've 
heard. If we can just remind people when they go to the grocery store 
that along with their snickers and cheerios -- I'm not going to try 
to get them to drop that altogether -- if they can buy some more apples, 
I think we'll be successful. And while Washington growers say they 
can ride out one bad year, in the long run, it may be a difficult 
struggle without an Asian recovery. Jane Clayson, ABC News, wanachee, 
Washington.
