President Clinton's national security team meets tomorrow to discuss 
possible military strikes against the Serbs. In the face of the threat, 
the Serbs are finally pulling their troops back. But the damage may 
already be done. Here's ABC's Mike Lee. This village, the scene of 
last weekend's massacre of 21 ethnic Albanians. Today, only a handful 
of villagers had come back home. And they worry it may have been too 
soon. Serb bombs were still hitting a neighboring village today, even 
as Serbian officials were telling the outside world the conflict was 
over and their troops had withdrawn. I've taken Shelter behind this 
stone wall. And I counted 12 more mortar rounds in 30 minutes. The 
local Albanians tell me its intermittent. It does not represent a 
major offensive. And it may be only some Serb units are protecting 
their rear flank as they withdraw. But it does illustrate that this 
conflict is slow to die out. A western diplomatic source told ABC 
News today, it appears that most Serb units have pulled back but many 
are within easy striking distance of the villages. Mou karheem and 
his wife savie are among the many Albanians still doubting it's over. 
Still wandering the country side. "One of my sons was killed and our 
home destroyed" savie. "We keep moving in order to stay alive." The 
other side also poses a risk to peace said western officials today. 
The Albanian rebel group the KLA is still conducting hit and run attacks 
on Serb police units. Throughout western Kosovo the humanitarian crisis 
continues. 250,000 Albanians displaced. Little Shelter or food. This 
woman says all she has S left is flour and salt. "We went to the hills 
but the Serbs came after us there, too. We just can't hide anymore." 
The nights are becoming colder. Emergency clothing, blankets and shoes 
have not reached many. Families huddle together and hope that the 
west has finally convinced the Serbs to back off. Mike Lee, ABC News, 
Kosovo.
