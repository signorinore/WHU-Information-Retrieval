Drug agents say every year, hundreds of tons of illegal marijuana 
are smuggled across the border into the United States. But which border? 
ABC's Lisa Salters reports on a surprising new front in the drug war. 
It's nighttime on the border. Cameras record yet another drug smuggler 
making his way across the border to the American side. But this is 
not Mexico, it's Canada. Is this a person on foot up in your area? 
There's probably not a night out here that we don't have activity 
taking place somewhere. The drug many smugglers here are carrying 
these days is marijuana, a new, more potent strain known as BC bud, 
even more potent than Mexican varieties. It's grown throughout British 
Columbia by Canadians looking to cash in on Americans' never-ending 
appetite for Pot. You could never produce enough Pot to fill the American 
market. The American market's insatiable. Canadian authorities have 
tried to crack down, but limited law enforcement resources, combined 
with tolerant attitudes, have earned Vancouver the reputation of being 
a drug haven. People don't get punished for growing marijuana, so 
this has become a place where people grow it for the deliberate purpose 
of exporting to the United States. a pound of BC bud in Canada costs 
$2,000. In Los Angeles or New York, it sells for $7,000. People smuggle 
things for one reason, to make money. They make a lot of money on 
BC bud. Customs officials say most of the Canadian marijuana enters 
the U.S. here, in blaine, Washington. And they say the traffic has 
quadrupled in the last two years. Creative smugglers use kayaks, private 
planes and even hollowed-out logs to bring BC bud across the border. 
But the most popular methods are still the simplest, by foot and by 
car. The U.S./Canadian border stretches for more than 3,000 miles. 
And with no major immigration problems, there are no fences to slow 
a smuggler's progress, which means in many cases, illegally crossing 
from Canadian to American soil is as simple as crossing the street. 
We have numerous situations where a car will pull up on the Canadian 
side, and it will stop. It will meet a car parked alongside of it 
on the U.S. side. And they'll simply throw the bag across the ditch. 
On this night, the agents end their shifts empty-handed and frustrated. 
No Pot smugglers tonight, but tomorrow night's another night. And 
there will likely be many more nights like this one, as the drug war 
heats up on yet another front. Lisa Salters, ABC News, at the U.S./Canadian 
border.
