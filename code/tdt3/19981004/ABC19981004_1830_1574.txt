Finally tonight, what cost tradition? Should taxpayers cough up millions 
to save an historic spot that's home to just a few hundred people? 
The place is Smith island, Maryland, first settled back in 1657. Here 
is ABC's Mark Mullen. For 300 years, the chesapeake bay has slowly 
been swallowing up Smith island, home to almost 400 people who harvest 
crabs from these waters. The problem, global warming is raising the 
level of the bay, making it easier for the island to flood. And erode. 
But erosion is not the only problem. There is also the theory that 
the island is irreversibly sinking. But it's not just land that's 
threatened. It's also a way of life. Probably to most folks it don't 
look like much sitting out here. Two-thirds of it's Marsh. But when 
you look into the history and all, then you find out how long it's 
been here. Islanders like their independence. There's no police department. 
No mayor. No council. In fact, the only recognized authority here 
is the local Methodist church. But for the first time ever, these 
proud people are asking for help. Residents are trying to lobby support 
for a $14 million plan by the army corps of engineers to slow erosion 
by erecting more of these wave barriers. If we can make them think 
that there's a future for them here, they'll continue on as a credible 
society. And they'll be here for us to visit or just to know about. 
But coastal geologist Stephen leatherman says slowing erosion on a 
sinking island is a waste of taxpayer money. I think just from rising 
sea level I give these people 10 years, 20 years tops. That's all? 
That's about it. They're out of time. This island's out of time. Leatherman 
points to a nearby island which was once home to a community of 400 
people. Now almost completely submerged, only a solitary house and 
a graveyard remain. Although we're getting few in number, we're still 
worth saving as long as we can. Smith Islanders know that one day 
their island home will be gone. Still, they hold out hope that somehow 
their historical way of life will continue even if it's just for a 
little longer. Mark Mullen, ABC News, Smith island, Maryland.
