BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Parliament votes Tuesday on 
whether to lift the immunity of France's National Front leader Jean-Marie 
Le Pen, so a German court can try him for calling the Holocaust ``a 
detail'' of history. The request for a waiver of Le Pen's parliamentary 
immunity came from prosecutors in Munich last April, after the far-right 
leader told a press conference ``the gas chambers were a detail in 
the history of the Second World War.'' The Front National refused 
to comment on the vote. ``We'll wait for Tuesday's result,'' a spokesman 
at the party's headquarters near Paris said. The vote will be held 
during the parliament's regular monthly meeting in Strasbourg, France. 
Munich's judicial authorities say they want to charge Le Pen under 
an article of the German criminal code which makes it an offense to 
belittle the Holocaust. If tried and convicted, Le Pen faces up to 
five years in prison. Under German law, members of the European Parliament 
cannot be prosecuted, unless the 626-seat European Union assembly 
votes to lift their immunity. French legislation gives European Parliament 
members less protection, and Le Pen has already been convicted in 
his homeland for assaulting a Socialist politician last year. The 
French court stripped Le Pen of his civil rights for two years, in 
effect banning him from holding office, running for office, or voting. 
He also was fined dlrs 3,300. Le Pen has appealed the French verdict. 
If upheld, the conviction could make Le Pen ineligible to run in the 
June 1999 European Parliament elections. He has said that in that 
case his wife, Jany, would run in his place. Last week, the European 
Parliament's 20-member procedures committee voted 16 to four to lift 
Le Pen's immunity. Le Pen is one of 12 National Front members in the 
European parliament.
