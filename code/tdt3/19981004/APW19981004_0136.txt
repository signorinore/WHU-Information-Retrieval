Pet owners brought a swarm of animals, including iguanas, pythons 
and a donkey, to be blessed at a Roman Catholic church in Manila Sunday. 
Our Lady of Remedios Church and an animal welfare group invited people 
to bring in their pets to mark the feast day of St. Francis of Assisi. 
But they were overwhelmed by the animals that turned up. The rite, 
offered for the first time at the church, was intended to draw public 
attention to St. Francis' cause of caring for animals and the environment, 
said the Rev. Francis Carey, the priest who led the animals' blessing. 
``I didn't realize there would be so many,'' he said. He counted at 
least 100 animals, including sheep, rabbits, parrots and a hedgehog. 
A group of men dragged in a donkey, and a small boy brought a fish 
in a glass bowl. Church-goers who attended mass stayed on to gawk 
at the animals, as the picturesque stone church began to smell and 
sound like a zoo. The blessing proceeded smoothly, except for some 
cats that squirmed when doused with holy water. ``I think the cats 
didn't like the water very much,'' Carey said.
