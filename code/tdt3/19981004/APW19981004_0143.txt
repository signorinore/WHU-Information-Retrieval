Police found an AK-47 assault rifle and seven bullet shells outside 
a court building Sunday, a day after police arrested four people believed 
to be involved in bomb attacks in this Portuguese enclave. The rifle 
was found after police said they received a report of a shooting by 
a man from a car which was carrying four people. The car was later 
found abandoned nearby. No one was injured in the shooting. On Saturday, 
police rounded up nine people following raids on a hotel and a bar. 
Four of them, including two former police officers, were detained 
on suspicion of involvement in a bomb attack in May in which the car 
of Macau's police director, Marquest Baptista, was destroyed. They 
were also suspected of a car bombing last month that injured five 
police officers and 10 journalists, police said. A district court 
on Sunday ordered the four to jail custody on charges of plotting 
bomb attacks and of being members of gangs. A spate of gangland-style 
killings, arson and other attacks_ many targeting government officials 
_ have plagued the enclave, famous for its gambling and tourism industries. 
Police say they believe the recent violence is linked to gang wars 
over gambling profits that have been shrinking because of Asia's economic 
crisis. Three government officials, including a gambling inspector, 
have been killed since March. Macau, which has a population of about 
450,000, will revert to Chinese rule next year. Earlier this month, 
China said it would send an elite detachment of soldiers to the territory 
to keep social order after it returns to Chinese sovereignty.
