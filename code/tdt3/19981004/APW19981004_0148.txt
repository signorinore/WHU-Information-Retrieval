Police killed 11 people, including a pregnant woman, in two weekend 
shootouts with groups of alleged criminals, Malaysian reports said 
Sunday. No police officers were injured in either of the firefights. 
Police said they killed six men in a van who refused to stop when 
intercepted late Saturday night and started to shoot at officers. 
The Kelantan state police chief said police had not identified the 
bodies, but that all the dead men were wanted on charges of armed 
robbery, firearms smuggling and drug trafficking. Five people were 
killed Friday night when police stormed a house in the capital to 
arrest the alleged kidnappers of a politician's son, The Sunday newspaper 
reported. The report said one of those killed was eight months pregnant, 
quoting her relatives. The woman and her husband were both killed, 
leaving daughters ages 5 and 8, the paper said. Two other men and 
a 19-year-old-woman who worked in a hair salon were also killed after 
police opened fire on the house. Police said those inside fired first 
and that the 3 million ringgit (dlrs 790,000) ransom was recovered 
in the house. The raid took place two hours after the ransom had been 
paid and the 11-year-old son of former Selangor state Gov. Muhammad 
Taib had been left uninjured by a roadside near the capital, according 
to news reports. Police said the kidnappers had threatened to kill 
the boy, but accepted half the ransom they had originally demanded. 
The boy was abducted while being driven to school on Sept. 28.
