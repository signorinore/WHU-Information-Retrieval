Police seized more than 2,000 tablets of the designer drug Ecstasy 
in raids Sunday on pharmacies and discos and arrested nine people 
on drug possession charges. Police accompanied by reporters and camera 
crews raided nine pharmacies before descending on the downtown Taipei 
Texound and Edge discos where they have staged lengthy undercover 
investigations seeking to identify drug suppliers. An American man, 
whose name was not disclosed, was also charged with working illegally 
as a disc jockey. Newspapers said 200 people ranging from ages 17 
to 56 were taken away for questioning. For many, it was the second 
or third time they had been caught in police raids, the papers reported. 
Police have stepped up efforts to stem the popularity among Taipei 
nightclubbers of Ecstacy, also known as MDMA, which induces a feeling 
of relaxation and euphoria. Users of the drug claim it adds to the 
appreciation of beat-heavy techno music played in clubs. Police send 
more than 30 stylishly dressed young male and female officers into 
Taipei clubs each weekend night to gain information on drug suppliers, 
the United Evening News reported.
