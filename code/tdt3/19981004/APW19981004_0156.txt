India's villagers may watch video e-mails in local post offices, but 
outside the special booths, thousands of children still die each year 
from preventable diseases. Even with one of the world's largest pools 
of scientists and engineers, India finds itself on both extremes of 
the information revolution. The disparity, as outlined in this years 
World Development Report, can be striking. In rural northern India, 
a conglomerate of computer software companies last week set up the 
first public video e-mail booth. In an experimental launch, illiterate 
village women who had never seen a computer before received video 
messages by e-mail from their husbands working in faraway Bombay. 
``The remotest village has the possibility of tapping a global store 
of knowledge beyond the dreams of anyone living a century ago, and 
more quickly and cheaply than anyone imagined only a few decades ago,'' 
wrote World Bank president James D. Wolfensohn in the forward of his 
agency's report. But among the 4 billion inhabitants of the underdeveloped 
world, huge gaps exist in access to education and technology, said 
the report released Sunday. India's problems are typical. In thousands 
of villages across India _ the World Bank's largest single borrower 
and the largest overall recipient of developments credits _ millions 
of people live with hunger, disease and misery. Preventable diseases 
like leprosy, tuberculosis, cataract blindness and malaria account 
for nearly 50 percent of all reported illnesses, leading to 470 deaths 
per 10,000 people, the report said. The HIV virus already has afflicted 
an estimated 3 million people, spreading largely because of lack of 
awareness about its prevention. India is riding a boom in cable television, 
telephony and Internet connectivity that promises a gradual change. 
But it is slow to absorb knowledge because it remains among the least 
educated countries in the world _ roughly one out of three school-age 
children is not enrolled in school, especially girls. ``For the poor, 
the promise of the new information age _ knowledge for all _ can seem 
as remote as a distant star.'' Wolfensohn said in the report.
