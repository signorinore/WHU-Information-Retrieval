Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the controversial ex-wife of President 
Nelson Mandela, feels threatened after a series of break-ins at her 
home, a newspaper reported Friday. In the third and most recent break-in, 
which occurred last week, one or more intruders ransacked her bedroom 
but took nothing, the Sunday Times reported. ``I think they are giving 
me a message that they will return for me very soon,'' Madikizela-Mandela 
was quoted as saying by the Johannesburg weekly. Police detective 
Inspector Mandla Hlakula said the intruder appeared to be ``a highly 
trained person,'' the newspaper said. No suspects were named. Madikizela-Mandela, 
who was divorced from Mandela in 1996, is the president of the ANC 
Women's League and a heroine of the anti-apartheid struggle. She was 
convicted in 1991 of kidnapping four young men and taking part in 
assaults on them. Initially sentenced to six years in jail, Madikizela-Mandela 
eventually paid a dlrs 3,200 fine on appeal. She has alienated many 
in the ANC by her criticism of the government's slow progress in solving 
social issues and her call for reintroduction of the death penalty 
to address soaring crime rates.
