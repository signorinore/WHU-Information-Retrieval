Philippine courts sentenced 48 people to death mostly on rape convictions 
last month, bringing to 748 the number of death row convicts since 
capital punishment was restored in 1994, an anti-crime group said 
Sunday. The Citizen's Drugwatch Foundation said that of the 48 death 
sentences, 45 were convicted on rape charges, two on murder charges 
and one parricide. Among those convicted of rape were 35 fathers accused 
of abusing their daughters, said the foundation, which includes as 
members many lawmakers crusading against crime and illegal drugs. 
Leo Echegaray, an impoverished house painter convicted of raping his 
10-year-old stepdaughter, is expected to soon become the first to 
be put to death by lethal injection. The Supreme Court has upheld 
at least 16 of the death sentences but has not yet given its final 
approval for the first to be carried out. A new Philippine constitution 
abolished the death penalty in 1987 but gave Congress the option of 
restoring it for crimes such as murder, kidnappings for ransom, rape 
and drug trafficking. A law restoring the penalty took effect in 1994. 
Philippine Roman Catholic Church leaders and other civilian groups 
oppose the death penalty, arguing there is no concrete proof that 
it could deter crime. The poor would be disadvantaged because they 
couldn't afford good lawyers for their defense, opponents say. Proponents 
say the death penalty has not caused a sharp drop in crimes because 
nobody has been executed to send a chilling example to would-be criminals. 
President Joseph Estrada has said he would not pardon Echegeray.
