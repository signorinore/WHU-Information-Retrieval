Mark Burton scored in the 24th minute Sunday to give New Zealand an 
upset 1-0 win over Australia in the final of the Oceania Nations Cup 
soccer tournament at Suncorp Stadium. The win gives New Zealand a 
spot in January's Confederations Cup tournament in Mexico City. Last 
December, Brazil beat Australia 6-0 in the Confederations Cup final 
at Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. New Zealand's winner came after striker Vaughan 
Coveny beat two diving tackles from Socceroo skipper Alex Tobin and 
Kasey Wehrman. Coveny darted around a poor diving tackle by Tobin 
before laying off for midfielder Burton who also beat a sliding tackle 
from Wehrman before slotting home. Australia's defeat was its first 
loss to New Zealand in nine previous clashes since the Kiwis downed 
Australia 2-0 in a World Cup qualifier in Auckland in 1989. Burton's 
goal also was the first time Australia had conceded a goal to New 
Zealand in eight matches. Earlier, Fiji survived a late comeback attempt 
by Tahiti to win 4-2 to finish in third place in the six-team tournament 
that also involved the Cook Islands and Vanuata.
