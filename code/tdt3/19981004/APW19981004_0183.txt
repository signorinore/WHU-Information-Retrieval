The price of shares in Switzerland's telephone company Swisscom has 
been set at 340 Swiss francs (dlrs 250) each, the company said Sunday. 
The issue was three-times oversubscribed, Swisscom said in a statement. 
Overall demand amounted to around 65 million shares, it added. The 
22,065 million shares, around 30 percent of the company's share capital, 
will raise around 7.5 billion francs (dlrs 5.5 billion), making it 
the largest European share offer so far this year. Swisscom, formerly 
the telecommunications arm of the Swiss government's postal service, 
confirmed in June its intention to float on the stock market. The 
Swiss government decided to go ahead with the sale, the country's 
biggest privatization yet, despite turmoil in global markets. Last 
month Ulrich Gygi, director at the Swiss Finance Ministry, said that 
``given extreme movements on the stock exchange, we are free to postpone 
the transaction.'' Also in September, officials said the initial price 
per share would be between 330 francs (dlrs 243) and 410 francs (dlrs 
301). The sale comprises 14.515 million shares of the government's 
holding in Swisscom plus 7.55 million new shares to be issued and 
sold by Swisscom. Trading of the shares starts Monday on the Swiss 
Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange.
