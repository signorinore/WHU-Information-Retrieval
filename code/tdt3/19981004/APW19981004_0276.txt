Fearing the conflict in Kosovo has reached a crucial point, the leaders 
of Bulgaria, Greece and Romania Sunday made an ``urgent appeal'' for 
an immediate cease-fire in the Albanian-dominated Yugoslav province. 
``The three leaders make an urgent and dramatic appeal to all sides 
involved and in particular the Yugoslav authorities, to work for a 
negotiated settlement of the conflict in Kosovo,'' they said in a 
joint statement issued at the end of a two-day meeting. Greek Premier 
Costas Simitis, Presidents Petar Stoyanov of Bulgaria and Emil Constantinescu 
of Romania all agreed that NATO military action in Kosovo could lead 
to an escalation and possible spread of the conflict. ``We who neighbor 
these countries can't be indifferent. That is why we decided to take 
a stand on this issue,'' Constantinescu said. Stoyanov added that 
``any conflict could create a chain reaction elsewhere.'' Their meeting 
in Delphi, home of the ancient oracle, came as U.N. secretary-general 
Kofi Annan prepared to submit a report on Yugoslav compliance with 
a Security Council resolution which demands an end to the offensive 
in Kosovo. The resolution threatens unspecified further action, which 
all three leaders hoped would not mean military intervention by NATO. 
``We believe that implementing this decision will lead to the avoidance 
of other measures, which we hope will not occur,'' Simitis said. But 
of the three countries, NATO and European Union-member Greece may 
be called on to provide assistance and support for a military strike. 
All three leaders said other countries seeking to play a role in the 
Balkans should consult with them before taking any action, pointing 
out that the European Union's weakness in forging a common foreign 
policy led to an escalation of the crisis in Kosovo. ``Neighboring 
states should be heard first. By resolving one conflict we should 
not create burdens for neighboring states. It should not impact negatively,'' 
Stoyanov said. One of their greatest fears, they said, would be a 
repetition of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the ensuing sanctions 
on Yugoslavia. All three countries lost billions of dollars when sanctions 
cut off a major European trade route through Yugoslavia. ``Because 
our countries are the closest they have the best knowledge on this 
and are the most affected, as we were affected by the conflict in 
Bosnia,'' Constantinescu said. Although all three leaders agreed with 
the need for greater autonomy for Kosovo's Albanians, they stressed 
their disagreement with their demand for full independence in Kosovo, 
the Serbian province which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian. Serbia is 
the dominant republic in what remains of Yugoslavia. ``A cease-fire 
should be put immediately into effect, parties should come to the 
negotiating table without preconditions, aiming at achieving a peaceful 
solution for a large autonomy for Kosovo within the internationally 
recognized borders of Yugoslavia ... so that another course of action 
be avoided,'' they said in their joint statement. Simitis added the 
meeting was a good opportunity for a discussion of the Oct. 12-13 
Balkan summit in Antalya, Turkey. During last year's summit in Crete, 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic spoke with Albania's prime minister, 
the first such high-level meeting in 49 years. ``Next Monday we will 
meet Milosevic and the Albanian prime minister in Antalya and we have 
said we will discuss it (Kosovo) there and try to find a specific 
solution to this specific problem,'' Simitis said.
