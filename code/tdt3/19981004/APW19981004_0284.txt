The National Union of Metalworkers ended a five-week long strike on 
Sunday by spare-part makers in the auto industry after agreeing on 
wage hikes. The strike was called off after union members endorsed 
the latest wage proposals, which include raises of up to 10 percent. 
The country's seven auto manufacturers had been nearly shut down because 
of a shortage of components caused by the strike.
