Romania and Bulgaria are still at odds over where to build a second 
bridge spanning the Danube river separating them, despite repeated 
discussions on the issue over the past three years, Bulgaria said 
Saturday. ``I won't hide that our positions continue to differ,'' 
Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov said after a two-day summit with 
leaders of Romania and Greece, but added that the disagreement is 
not ``at the core of a serious argument'' between the two countries. 
``Two neighboring countries with a common border of 300 kilometers 
(187 miles) should not have just one or two bridges connecting them 
but more,'' Stoyanov said. The bridge would be part of a trans-European 
highway currently under consideration which would originate in St. 
Petersburg, Russia, cross through Ukraine, Romania and Bulgaria and 
end in the northern Greek port town of Alexandroupolis. But the dispute, 
which has been around since Greece, Bulgaria and Romania held their 
first trilateral meeting in northern Greece in 1995, should no longer 
be seen in a purely political context, Stoyanov said. ``The conflict 
in Kosovo is bringing this issue to the fore because the bridge will 
make the shortest route circumventing Yugoslavia,'' he noted. The 
only bridge linking the two countries, from Bulgaria's Danube port 
of Ruse with Romania's Giurgiu, was unable to convey sufficient traffic 
because of economic sanctions levied on Yugoslavia as a consequence 
of the Bosnian conflict. Bulgaria says it incurred more than dlrs 
3 billion in trade losses because of the sanctions. Three ferry routes 
also span the Danube to link the two countries. Romanian President 
Emil Constantinescu said Bulgaria and Romania agreed to set up a committee 
of experts which will ``analyse all possible solutions and phases 
concerned with such ties between Romania and Bulgaria.'' During a 
previous trilateral meeting held in April on the Greek island of Santorini, 
the three countries had agreed to set up a working group to study 
the problems with the bridge.
