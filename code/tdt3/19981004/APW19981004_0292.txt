Israelis built makeshift huts and shopped for special fruits Sunday 
as they prepared to mark Sukkot, a festive Jewish holiday commemorating 
the desert wanderings of their ancestors. But this holiday, like a 
recent string of others _ including last month's Jewish New Year and 
Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement _ was shadowed by security fears. 
Israel sealed off the Palestinian lands and imposed tight security 
in Israel proper, citing warnings of attacks by the radical Islamic 
group Hamas. The seven-day Sukkot festival, also known as the Feast 
of the Tabernacles, was beginning at sundown on Sunday. Most shops, 
businesses and offices were to be shut Monday, and some will have 
shortened hours all week. Many Israelis use their yards or balconies 
to build a traditional sukkah, meant to remind them of huts used by 
the ancient Israelites during their 40-year trek across the Sinai 
desert after fleeing Egypt. Some religious Jews sleep in the huts, 
made of wood and palm branches _ or, in a more modern version, of 
plastic and canvas _ and decorated with hanging fruit. Sukkot celebrates 
the fall harvest as well. Yonah Berman, 17, of Teaneck, New Jersey, 
who is in Israel to study at a Jewish seminary, said he had celebrated 
the holiday in the United States but ``it's obviously a lot nicer 
here because everyone is doing it.'' At Jerusalem's covered Mahane 
Yehuda market, whole rows of tables sold only Sukkot-related items, 
including a prime symbol, inedible lemon-like citrus fruits called 
etrogs. Orthodox Jews scrutinized them carefully to make sure they 
were suitable. On the security front, police said a heightened alert 
would continue through the entire holiday. Measures included a total 
ban on parking in the walled Old City, and extra soldiers and police 
were patrolling busy public places. Sukkot has strong associations 
with nature, and Israelis escaped in droves to the country's national 
parks for camping or hiking. About 25,000 Israelis were expected to 
cross the border for trips to the Sinai peninsula. Not everyone was 
leaving the city, though _ Sukkot is one of three holidays of pilgrimage, 
when Israelis from all over the country come to Jerusalem. In biblical 
times, Jews journeyed here to take part in ritual sacrifices at the 
Holy Temple. Modern-day Sukkot commemorations include a ceremony involving 
hundreds of ``cohanim,'' or descendants of the priestly caste of biblical 
times, who converge at the Western Wall in the Old City. With white 
prayer shawls over their head, they recite a verse from Numbers _ 
``May the Lord bless thee and guard thee.'' That blessing was invoked 
daily in the temple in ancient Jerusalem by the cohanim, who trace 
their heritage to Aaron, Moses' brother and the first biblical high 
priest. The Western Wall is believed to be the outer wall of the temple 
rebuilt by King Herod in Roman times to replace the mammoth temple 
King Solomon built around 1000 B.C. Secular politics played a role 
in holiday observances, too. At a ceremony to usher in Sukkot, Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lightheartedly told an audience that its 
symbols also symbolized the strength of his ruling coalition.
