An anti-terrorist police unit will be moved to Mostar to investigate 
recent ``terrorist'' acts against Muslims trying to go return to the 
region they were driven out of during Bosnia's war, the Croat-Muslim 
Interior Ministry said Sunday. The police announcement was accompanied 
by a report of another anti-Muslim attack Sunday _ two bombs thrown 
at a house recently reclaimed by a Muslim refugee in a village near 
Stolac, in southern Bosnia. Stolac, 120 kilometers (about 70 miles) 
south of Sarajevo, is a disputed town in the south of the country, 
run by Bosnian Croats. All Muslims from the region fled their homes 
during Muslim-Croat fighting in 1993, part of the larger conflict 
against the Serbs. An agreement between local Muslim and Croat politicians 
was reached beginning 1998 to allow all refugees to return to their 
homes in the area. But more than 40 incidents _ most of them anti 
Muslim _ have been recorded since the refugees started returning in 
March. None of the perpetrators have been questioned or detained. 
One Muslim was killed and three others injured Friday in a series 
of explosions outside Muslim homes in nearby Tasovcici village, where 
Muslims returned three days ago. The area official responsible for 
police, Valentin Coric, a Bosnian Croat, resigned Saturday, presumably 
reacting to the latest incidents. Although formally linked in a federation, 
Bosnian Croats and Muslims remain suspicious of each other. Hard-line 
Bosnian Croat officials opposed to coexistence with Muslims are blamed 
for most of the tensions.
