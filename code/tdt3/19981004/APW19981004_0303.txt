Police detained 500 illegal immigrants in the Dardanelles strait region 
early Sunday as they attempted to board a ship headed for Italy, news 
reports said. In the largest operation this year, police detained 
a group of Syrians, Afghanis, Iraqi Kurds and Palestinians, including 
an unspecified number of women and children, the Anatolia news agency 
reported. Officials could not be reached for comment. Thousands of 
foreigners have been rounded up since the beginning of the year after 
European nations put pressure on Turkey to impose stricter control 
on its coasts and borders to prevent an exodus of Kurds and other 
foreigners to Europe.
