Germany's new Social Democratic-led government will repeal cuts in 
pensions passed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl before they take effect 
Jan. 1, a party leader said Sunday. In an interview with German radio, 
parliamentary faction leader Rudolf Scharping said his party will 
also ``immediately'' implement another campaign promise: repealing 
a 1996 law allowing employers to cut sick pay by 20 percent. Both 
measures were part of the modest economic reforms pushed through parliament 
by Kohl, who lost his bid for a fifth term last month to the Social 
Democrats, led by Gerhard Schroeder. The new chancellor-elect opened 
coalition talks Friday with the ecology-minded Greens party, setting 
combating unemployment, particularly in eastern Germany, as their 
top priority. While no talks were held over the weekend, all sides 
continued staking out positions. Industry leaders warned they would 
leave Schroeder's proposed roundtable talks on job creation if union 
leaders insist on a shorter work week or too-high wages. Hans Peter 
Stihl, chairman of the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce, also 
told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper that some proposals being being 
considered by the center-left government would actually lead to ``a 
renewed climb in unemployment.'' Those include raising energy taxes, 
canceling a high-speed train link between Berlin and Hamburg, and 
shutting down the country's nuclear power reactors, he said. In an 
interview with the same newspaper, Schroeder ruled out a significant 
rise in gasoline taxes, saying it would be unfair to commuters. Schroeder 
said he would accept an increase of no more than 6 pfennig (4 cents) 
per liter, not the 30 pfennig (18 cents) some Greens have demanded. 
Greens leader Juergen Trittin refused to comment on specifics at a 
mini party convention Sunday. But fellow Green leader Joschka Fischer, 
considered more of a pragmatist than Trittin, told the party faithful 
that it was time to move from old ideals to ``professional negotiating.'' 
Noting that the Greens actually lost votes this year compared with 
the 1994 election, Fischer blamed ``exaggerated'' proposals like raising 
the price of gas to 5 marks a liter (dlrs 12 a gallon). ``We almost 
pushed ourselves over the precipice that the new center-left government 
may support setting a speed limit of 120-130 kph (75-80 mph) on Germany's 
autobahns. The Greens met Sunday to confirm their party's 12-person 
team for coalition negotiations. The party's women's council called 
for at least half the Cabinet seats to go to women. The sides hope 
to complete talks by Oct. 17 so that Schroeder can be sworn in as 
chancellor by Oct. 27. Schroeder, who made his first post-election 
trip to Paris on Wednesday, plans to visit Washington on Thursday. 
Fischer, considered the front-runner to become foreign minister in 
Schroeder's yet-to-be-formed Cabinet, will accompany him, Scharping 
said.
