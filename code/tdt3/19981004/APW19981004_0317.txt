On a weekend meant to celebrate German unity, an estimated 1 million 
Berliners stormed a brand new shopping and entertainment complex on 
what used to be the no-man's land of the Berlin Wall. In scenes reminiscent 
of the exuberant days that followed the Wall's collapse in 1989, the 
10 new streets through Potsdamer Platz were full of shoppers and strollers 
admiring the brightly lit complex built by Daimler-Benz at a cost 
of 4 billion marks (dlrs 2.4 billion). ``It's like 1989, when they 
tore the Wall down,'' said one excited visitor. ``It's unbelievable 
here,'' said an elderly man, almost in tears. Most stores in Germany 
closed for Saturday's German Unification Day holiday. But those at 
Potsdamer Platz were open until midnight _ and were packed till the 
end. ``I've been waiting since 8 o'clock to go home,'' one flustered 
salesclerk said shortly before midnight. ``But with this chaos you 
can't even think of it.'' The newly opened Mendelssohn-Bartholdy-Park 
subway station was so jammed at times trains couldn't load or unload 
passengers, and just passed through without stopping. Before World 
War II, the square in the center of Berlin was one of Europe's busiest 
intersections _ site of the first traffic signal on the continent. 
What wasn't destroyed by Allied bombing during World War II, though, 
was torn down when the area became part of the ``death strip'' between 
the Wall's two sections. Daimler-Benz and Sony stepped in after unification, 
turning the wasteland into Europe's biggest construction site. The 
19-building Daimler-Benz complex, which officially opened Friday, 
includes apartments, shops, theaters, a casino, hotel and offices 
around a square named for actress Marlene Dietrich, a Berlin native. 
Italian architect Renzo Piano oversaw the project and designed the 
centerpiece, a 20-story, terra cotta office tower for the Daimler-Benz's 
financial service unit, Debis. Sony expects to have its European headquarters 
on the site finished by 2000.
