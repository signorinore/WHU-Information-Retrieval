Iraq has signed an agreement with the World Food Program, a U.N. agency, 
to expand its special feeding program for the poor, an Iraqi minister 
was quoted Sunday as saying. The labor and social affairs minister, 
Lt. Gen. Saadi Tu'ma, told the Al-Musawir Al-Arabi weekly that ``the 
ministry has signed a deal with the World Food Program, which Iraq 
has supported financially in the past, to increase food items for 
poor Iraqis.'' He said that the number eligible for the monthly food 
aid would increase to 943,000 from the current 240,000, starting in 
November, the paper said. Tu'ma did not make clear who would pay for 
expanding the program, which in the past was underwritten by the Iraqi 
government. The food aid is over and above the monthly food ration 
that all Iraqis receive under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program. 
The special feeding program makes available to the poor 5 kilograms 
(11 pounds) of flour, 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds) of sugar, 2 kilograms 
(4.4 pounds) of lentils and 2 kilograms of cooking oil. The monthly 
ration for all Iraqis includes flour, rice, sugar, tea, lentils, salt, 
cooking oil, soap and detergent. There's also a special ration of 
milk for babies. The United Nations hopes to add protein in the form 
of whole milk for adults to the November ration. The oil-for-food 
program is an exception from U.N. trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 
1990 invasion of Kuwait. It allows Iraq to sell limited quantities 
of oil to buy food, medicine and other necessities for its 22 million 
people.
