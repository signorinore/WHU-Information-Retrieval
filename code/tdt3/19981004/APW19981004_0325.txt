German Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder will address the annual 
conference of Britain's employers' organization, the Confederation 
of British Industry, next month, the organization announced Sunday. 
The speech will likely be Schroeder's first major statement in Britain 
since the Social Democrats' election victory last month. Italian Prime 
Minister Romano Prodi will also address the Nov. 1-3 meeting in the 
central England city of Birmingham.
