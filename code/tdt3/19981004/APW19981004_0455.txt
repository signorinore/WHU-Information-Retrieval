Iran's powerful parliament speaker left Sunday for talks in Italy 
and Spain, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. Ali 
Akbar Nateq-Nouri told reporters at the airport that the purpose of 
his week-long trip is to discuss political issues and to expand trade 
relations between Tehran and the two countries. Nateq-Nouri, a leading 
hard-liner in the Iranian government, will meet with a number of senior 
officials including Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi. In Spain 
he will meet with Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and King Juan Carlos. 
Nateq-Nouri's trip follows an announcement by the Iranian government 
distancing itself from the death edict on British author Salman Rushdie 
and the dlrs 2.5 million bounty placed on his head in 1989 by a semi-official 
Iranian foundation. The announcement last month by Foreign Minister 
Kamal Kharrazi angered hard-liners. Nateq-Nouri has not publicly commented 
on the government's position but 150 members of the hard-line parliament 
he heads said Sunday the death edict was irrevocable, Iranian television 
reported. ``As Majlis deputies, we assure Muslims all over the world 
that, in this case, nothing except the decrees issued by God and (Khomeini) 
in Iran have any credibility and no one has the power to follow any 
other path,'' said the letter, the television reported. Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini, the late Iranian leader, said that Rushdie must 
die for blaspheming Islam in his novel ``The Satanic Verses.'' The 
Rushdie affair strained ties with the European Union. Moderate President 
Mohammad Khatami, who defeated Nateq-Nouri in elections in 1997, has 
been trying to improve ties with the West since he took office. Tehran 
also wants to increase trade with Italy, its fourth biggest trading 
partner. Trade between the two countries totaled dlrs 2.3 billion 
last year.
