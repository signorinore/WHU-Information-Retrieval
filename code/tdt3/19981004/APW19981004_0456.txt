In the Arab world's biggest sing-along, at least half a million people 
joined in chorus with 23 top singers in a concert more about politics 
than Arab pop music's usual fare of love and romance. The show Saturday 
night in Beirut's main square was a live version of a popular music 
video called ``The Arab Dream,'' which is a plea for unity in the 
divided Arab world. In the video, the song is accompanied by old newsreels 
from the Arabs' long battle with Israel: Palestinians fleeing their 
homes at the founding of the Jewish state in 1948 and, more recently, 
Lebanese pulling bodies from wreckage left by Israeli artillery. The 
video has been distributed only to TV stations, and some Gulf satellite 
outlets say they're getting dozens of requests to broadcast ``The 
Arab Dream'' from viewers who want to tape it. It appears several 
times a day on Beirut stations. Performers at Saturday's concert hailed 
from 16 Arab countries and included such heartthrobs as Tunisia's 
Latifa, Egypt's Anoushka and Kadhem al-Saher of Iraq. At the climax 
of the concert, each of the singers sang a stanza of ``The Arab Dream,'' 
and audience and performers joined in the refrain about Arab unity. 
``The darkness of the night may have separated us. A beam of light 
can carry us to the farthest skies. This has always been our dream, 
one nation to embrace us all,'' goes the song. ``The Arab Dream'' 
was written to ``gently prod Arab leaders through art to ... convene 
a summit meeting,'' said Rabeh Ayyoub, spokesman for the organizers 
of Saturday's concert. The last Arab summit was in 1990 when Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait split the Arab world into pro- and anti-Iraq camps. 
Ayyoub said the ``darkness'' in the lyrics refers to ``the current 
Arab state of affairs ... the failure to take collective action after 
50 years since the establishment of Israel.'' Beirut radio stations 
estimated 500,000 to one million people crowded into or around Martyr's 
Square for the concert. The show started two hours late after scuffles 
broke out as police held back the vast crowds pushing toward the stage. 
Some in the audience carried placards of late Egyptian President Gamal 
Abdel Nasser, a symbol of Arab unity. Others shouted slogans and waved 
the flags of various Arab nations and the Palestinians. ``The Arab 
Dream'' was written by poets Midhat el-Adl of Egypt and Salem Seif 
al-Khaledi of the United Arab Emirates. The video, produced in August, 
and the Beirut concert were organized by Ahmed el-Aryan, an Egyptian-Palestinian 
who lives in the Emirates. Despite the song's theme of unity, divisions 
showed up at the concert. Iraqi singer al-Saher does not appear in 
the video _ apparently because of fears that popular Kuwait singer 
Nabil Shuail would refuse to join in if al-Saher was included. The 
Iraqi sang Saturday night. Just before the concert, it was announced 
the Kuwaiti would not appear.
