Jacky Durand of France clinched the Paris-Tours World Cup cycling 
race on Sunday after a winning a sprint finish against Italian Mirco 
Gualdi. Durand, who races for the Casino team, collects 100 World 
Cup points for winning the 254 kilometer (141 mile) race from Paris 
to Tours. Gualdi, who rides for the Polti team, picks up 75 points. 
In wet conditions, the two riders broke away from the pack two kilometers 
from the end, and Durand powered away to become the first French winner 
of the Paris-Tours race since Albert Bouvet's victory in 1956. Estonia's 
Jaan Kirsipuu, Durand's team mate, came third, 30 second behind the 
winner, ahead of Italians Stefano Zanini in fourth and Nicola Minali 
in fifth. Michele Bartoli, of the Asics team, could have regained 
his World Cup title with a good finish on Sunday but didn't figure 
among the leaders.
