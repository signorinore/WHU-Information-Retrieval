The flight plan filed by a Ugandan pilot of an airplane which crashed 
en route to eastern Congo was altered, apparently to conceal its real 
destination, a newspaper reported Sunday. The destination of the plane 
was erased and the town of Kasese, 390 kilometers (245 miles) west 
of Kampala, on the foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains, inserted, 
Sunday Vision reported. It quoted a sister of one of the passengers 
as saying the group was flying directly to Bunia in northeastern Congo 
en route to Kisangani, Congo's third largest town now controlled by 
Congolese rebels trying to oust President Laurent Kabila. Military 
officials earlier gave similar information and said the plane had 
been spotted over Kasese but never landed. The state-owned newspaper 
said three of the passengers had business links with Kenya, Uganda 
and Congolese towns of Bunia and Kisangani. The Civil Aviation of 
Authority in Uganda did no receive any signal from the pilot, but 
was informed from Kasese the airplane had taken off, Sunday Vision 
said. The twin-engine Islander, with 10 passengers, including a senior 
military official, crash-landed Sept. 25 near Kisomoro, about 60 kilometers 
(38 miles) north of Kasese, and it appeared that the disoriented survivors 
split into two groups to try to find their way out of the remote area. 
Uganda's army located five survivors Thursday and Friday. The pilot 
was killed. Lt. Col. Jet Mwebaze, a brother of acting Chief of Staff 
James Kazini, who had been on the plane, was among the four passengers 
missing. The passengers included an Israeli, an Asian, a Congolese 
and several Ugandans.
