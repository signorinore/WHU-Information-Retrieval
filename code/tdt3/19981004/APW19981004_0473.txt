Protesters took up Communist flags and banners for the second day 
Sunday to mark the bloody fighting between opposition lawmakers and 
government troops that broke out in Moscow five years ago. Bearing 
pictures of some of the estimated 200 people who were killed during 
the clashes on Oct. 3-4, 1993, about 3,000 people gathered at Smolenskaya 
Square in downtown Moscow to demand the resignation of President Boris 
Yeltsin and honor the dead. Protest organizers had predicted that 
more than ten times that number would turn out for the protest. ``For 
seven years we have had barbarians, betrayers and marauders in power,'' 
thundered Gennady Zyuganov, leader of Russia's Communist Party. ``Today 
comes the time of reckoning for the final results of this incompetent 
policy.'' Gen. Albert Makashov, one of the hard-liners at the center 
of the October 1993 troubles, called for Yeltsin and his reform team 
to pay for the pain they'd allegedly caused the Russian people. ``Yeltsin 
should be turned into soap,'' he said, adding that the other reformers 
should be led to the medieval site of executions on Moscow's Red Square 
for judgment and punishment. The protesters marched from the square 
to the main Russian government building, the White House, to continue 
their protest. Viktor Anpilov, head of the radical Russian Labor movement, 
delivered an equally blunt message at a Sunday meeting of the Fifth 
Congress of Officers of the USSR. ``Any politician who seeks to preserve 
the presidency is the enemy of the people,'' he said. ``And what should 
the officers do with the enemies of the people?'' ``Shoot them!,'' 
the crowd of about 300 hollered back. The 1993 skirmishes were sparked 
when Yeltsin decided to dissolve the conservative, Soviet-era parliament. 
Hard-line lawmakers refused to disband and barricaded themselves inside 
the White House. The standoff erupted into violence when an angry 
mob of supporters broke through police lines from the White House 
into the neighboring building housing the Moscow mayor's office. Armed 
hard-liners later attempted to storm the Ostankino television broadcasting 
center. The next day, Yeltsin called in troops and tanks that shelled 
parliament and forced his foes to surrender. The weekend rallies were 
precursors to what are predicted to be much larger, country-wide protests 
on Wednesday, organized by Russia's trade unions and the Communists. 
The leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexy II, expressed 
concern Sunday that the protests this week would bring bloodshed. 
``When people take to the streets, there are always those who can 
provoke disturbances,'' Alexy said, according to the Interfax news 
agency. He said that the Church, which had initiated negotiations 
between the opposed camps in 1993, would continue to be ``a conciliatory 
force in society.''
