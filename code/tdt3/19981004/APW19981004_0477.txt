As new stone-throwing clashes broke out Sunday in the West Bank, Israel 
and the Palestinians both said the other side held the key to an Israeli 
troop withdrawal. Security was tight in advance of a Jewish holiday 
beginning at sundown Sunday, and the Palestinian lands remained sealed 
off. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is due to arrive Tuesday 
for talks in advance of a hoped-for summit in Washington later this 
month, and both sides have been busy staking out positions in advance 
of her visit. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly 
accused the Palestinians of not doing enough to crack down on Islamic 
militants, said Israel's security was his paramount concern. ``Israel 
has shown its willingness to go the distance,'' he told reporters 
at a ceremony to usher in the Jewish holiday of Sukkot. ``Now it's 
up to the Palestinians to show their willingness to carry out their 
part.'' Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority has said it is working 
to contain militant groups like Hamas, but that even its best efforts 
cannot provide an ironclad guarantee against attacks. Two days before 
Albright's scheduled arrival, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat expressed 
hopes for a speedy accord, but said any movement must come from the 
Israeli side. ``She has one yes in her pocket; that is Arafat's yes,'' 
Erekat said of Albright. ``In order to reach an agreement she needs 
a second yes, and that is Mr. Netanyahu's.'' The Palestinians earlier 
this year accepted terms of an American-authored initiative on an 
Israeli troop pullback, but Netanyahu balked, citing security concerns. 
Erekat spoke to reporters during a break in talks with Israeli Cabinet 
Secretary Danny Naveh. The two were mainly discussing secondary issues, 
including the so-called safe passage that would permit Palestinian 
travel between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the status of Palestinian 
prisoners. In an intensified effort to resolve those issues, Erekat 
said he would meet daily with Naveh until the mid-October summit in 
Washington. He said that Albright is likely to participate in some 
of those meetings during her visit. American officials participated 
in the meeting between Erekat and Naveh. Sunday's West, 12th graf
