TOULOUSE, France (AP) - Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands beat No.1 
seed Gred Rusedski 6-4, 6-4 to win the dlrs 400,000 Toulouse Open 
tennis tournament Sunday. Siemerink took 62 minutes to beat the hard-hitting 
British player and win his fourth career title. Most recently Siemerink 
won the Rotterdam ATP tournament in March. No. 2 seed Siemerink got 
a breakthrough in the fifth game of the first set, when he broke Rusedski's 
powerful serve to go 3-2 ahead. The Dutchman hit a fine backhand return 
to go level at 30-30 and then hit another after Rusedski should have 
buried a comfortable-looking backhand volley. Rusedski, the world's 
No. 14, had his best chance to break back when Siemerink was serving 
at 4-3 ahead. But at 30-30, Siemerink made a fine smash and followed 
up with a ferocious first serve to hold the game and go 5-3 ahead. 
In the second set, the left-handed Siemerink broke serve in the third 
game and served consistently to clinch the title. Siemerink, 28, beat 
No. 3 seed Thomas Johansson of Sweden and Wimbledon junior champion 
Roger Federer, Switzerland, on his way to the final.
