Government soldiers fought through mortar fire from guerrilla ranks 
to advance farther northward from a town which fell to the military 
in fierce battles last week, the military said Sunday. Six rebels 
were killed in the fighting on Saturday near Mankulam town, but there 
were no military casualties, a military statement added. The area 
is 245 kilometers (153 miles) north of Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital. 
Last week, government soldiers and Tamil Tiger rebels fought fierce 
battles near the northern towns of Kilinochchi and Mankulam in which 
at least 1,200 people died. The battles along a northern highway the 
military is trying to capture were among the heaviest in Sri Lanka's 
15-year ethnic war. The capture of the highway, linking the isolated 
northern Jaffna peninsula with the southern mainland, will allow the 
government to transport supplies overland instead of by air and sea. 
The military has wrested two-thirds of the war-scarred highway. Meanwhile, 
the government is planning to hand over a report on 24 child Tamil 
rebels to the United Nations, a newspaper said Sunday. The report 
will be handed over to Olara Ottunu, United Nations Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan's special representative on children and war, the independent 
weekly ``Sunday Times'' quoted a senior foreign ministry official 
as saying. Ottunu visited Sri Lanka in May earlier this year, and 
got commitments from the rebels and the government not to use children 
in war. The children surrendered to the military on wednesday in the 
thick of fighting, according to the government. They are being detained 
and the government has not said what it plans to do with them. Under 
emergency laws, they can be held without trial indefinitely. In a 
photograph published by the government, the children appear to be 
treated well. More than 55,000 people have been killed since the fighting 
began in 1983 between the military and the rebels who want to form 
a separate homeland in the country's north and east.
