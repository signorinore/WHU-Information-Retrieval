England's Lee Westwood beat Sweden's Fredrik Jacobson in a playoff 
to win the Belgian Belgacom Open Sunday, keeping his chances alive 
of ending the European Tour season as the top golfer. Westwood took 
the lead for the first time on the 12th hole Sunday before Jacobson 
came back on the 17th with a birdie to force a playoff with both men 
tied at 16-under par. On the par 4 playoff hole, Jacobson hit his 
second shot to 14 feet (4.3 meters), compared to Westwood's 20 feet 
(6.1 meters), but the Englishman won his fourth tournament of the 
year with great putting. If Westwood now wins the season-ending Volvo 
Masters at the end of the month, he will dethrone Colin Montgomerie, 
a no-show here, as Europe's No. 1. Westwood, No. 2 in the rankings, 
shot a 5-under 66 Sunday, one shot better than Jacobson's 67 on Sunday. 
Jacobson, who was ranked 127th in Europe, needed a top-eight finish 
to hold on to his European Tour card next year and did considerably 
better. Another Swede, Robert Karlsson, finished joint third with 
New Zealand's Greg Turner, two shots off the lead. Jarmo Sandelin 
of Sweden and England's Peter Mitchell were another two shots back 
at 12-under. The 66,600 pound (dlrs 113,000) first prize brought Westwood 
within easy striking distance of Scotland's Montgomerie. He now trails 
the Scot's leading 760,077 pounds (dlrs 1.29 million) by just 45,400 
pounds (dlrs 77,000), which is less than the difference in prize money 
between the top two at the Volvo Masters in Spain. ``It's in my hands 
now,'' Westwood said. It was the first time the Belgian Open was held 
since 1994, when Nick Faldo won.
