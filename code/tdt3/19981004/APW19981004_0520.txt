A day after she was quoted as saying she was through with fashion 
shows, Claudia Schiffer said she was misunderstood. ``I'm not quitting,'' 
the German top model said in a statement issued Sunday by her publicists, 
Hoffmann Media. The 28-year-old Schiffer said that when she told a 
Rome newspaper she wouldn't work the runways anymore, she meant only 
in Milan. She said she has three new campaigns as model planned for 
1999, and continues under contract with L'Oreal cosmetics, Citroen 
cars and a mail-order firm. ``For me, the runway work was only a small 
part of my modeling career, and more important at the beginning to 
become known internationally,'' she said. But ``for almost two years 
now I've only done fashion shows occasionally and for special causes, 
for example, for Valentino.'' In Saturday's Il Messaggero, Schiffer 
was quoted as saying she was leaving fashion shows behind for movies 
and advertising. ``I love fashion but I never really liked the runway,'' 
she was quoted as saying.
