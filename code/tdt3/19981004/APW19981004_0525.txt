MILAN, Italy (AP) The Italian Spring-Summer 1999 collections just 
opened over the weekend, but already there is lots to talk about. 
The good news is that the Italian designers are thinking simple for 
next year's warm weather season. The bad news is that top model Claudia 
Schiffer announced her runway retirement. The non-news is that neither 
Monica Lewinsky nor the Rome based Gattinoni fashion house who offered 
the former White House intern dlrs 500,000 to model for its ``size 
plus'' line showed up for the ``moda Milanese'' fashion week. It's 
too early to declare the week's fashion winners, but the booby prize 
is sure to go to Francesco Coveri who Saturday showed a nude model 
bathing in a tub of lukewarm milk. ``It's a shame when fashion is 
transformed into a fourth rate circus,'' said Stefano Gabbana, of 
the Dolce and Gabbana duo, who presented their D&AMP;G line Saturday. 
The latest look of the label favored by the disco set harks back to 
the coffee shop waitress. In the contemporary version the prim black 
dress becomes a sexy tube dress and the apron is in transparent plastic 
with cargo pants pockets. Schiffer said goodbye to the runway at the 
end of her only scheduled appearance at the Milan collection's Friday 
night for designer friend Giorgio Ferrari. A radiant Naomi Campell 
made her first appearance of the week Sunday for Gai Mattiolo. Wearing 
a shimmering silver lame gown with demure front and plunging back, 
the other ``most famous'' top model walked down the runway arm in 
arm with the young Roman designer at the end of his much-applauded 
show. Rising star Mattiolo, whose body-hugging styles and love of 
bright shades reminded many of the late Gianni Versace, opts for a 
demure rather than daring look for next summer. His models have romantic 
pinned-up hair styles, wear little makeup and love soft fabrics, lace 
and empire waists. Already a favorite among the Italian entertainment 
crowd, and well known in Asia, Mattiolo may soon appear on the U.S. 
fashion racks. ``His fragrance is already doing very well,'' said 
Edward Menicheschi, a Vogue America publisher. Romeo Gigli, who showed 
Sunday on a circular runway in a new fashion hall of the Milan trade 
fair, was also in a romantic mood. Like Mattiolo, his models opted 
for innocence with childlike hair styles, pale makeup and high-waisted 
styles. Antique gold and silver gray were the favorite Gigli shades, 
and lace and sheer chiffon the favorite fabrics. Over the coming week, 
Italy's most famous fashion houses, including Armani, Ferre, Fendi, 
Gucci, Prada and Versace will present their version of the 1999 warm 
weather style. According to trend watchers the season promises to 
be soft and simple, bare but not too bold.
