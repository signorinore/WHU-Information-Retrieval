It's a tough one. In an apparent failure of royal liaison, Queen Elizabeth 
has been invited to two family parties on Nov. 14. Now she must decide 
whether to attend grandson Peter Phillips' 21st birthday celebrations, 
or a party marking her son Prince Charles' 50th birthday, organized 
by his longtime love, Camilla Parker Bowles. It's a duplication of 
dates unheard of in a world where diaries are carefully coordinated 
months, if not years, ahead of time, and has prompted speculation 
of royal rifts. ''The queen is aware that there is a clash, but no 
decision has yet been made,'' said a Buckingham Palace spokesman, 
speaking with customary anonymity. Princess Anne, the queen's only 
daughter, chose Nov. 14 to celebrate her son's birthday at Windsor 
Castle, west of London, although his birthday is not until the following 
day. Mrs. Parker Bowles is reported to have organized a private party 
the same night at Charles' country home, Highgrove, in western England. 
His birthday is Nov. 14. Buckingham Palace refused to comment on a 
report in The Mail on Sunday tabloid that the clash ''is the first 
public evidence of current tensions between senior royals,'' divided 
over plans to modernize the monarchy in the wake of the death of Princess 
Diana. The newspaper said Charles has angered his sister by trying 
to emulate Diana's more approachable, hands-on style during public 
engagements. Anne feels this is stealing the limelight from other 
members of the royal family, who do valuable charity work, The Mail 
on Sunday said.
