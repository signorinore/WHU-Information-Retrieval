The chief financial officer of Switzerland's Zurich Insurance Co. 
has resigned over an investigation into possible insider trading, 
the company said Sunday. Markus Rohrbasser, 44, offered his resignation 
over a Swiss investigation linked to the merger of Zurich's financial 
services business and that of British tobacco group B.A.T., Zurich 
Financial Services said in a statement. The procedure opened by the 
Zurich district attorney's office, which targets no named individuals, 
was prompted by unusual movements in Zurich shares prior to the announcement 
in October 1997 of the Zurich-B.A.T. merger. The merger, completed 
last month, created one of the world's largest insurance and asset 
management companies. The inquiry is still completely open, but Rohrbasser 
offered to quit in the interests of the company, the Zurich statement 
stressed. Zurich named Guenther Gose, a board member since 1990, to 
replace Rohrbasser, who has already left the company.
