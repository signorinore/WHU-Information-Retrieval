A top economic official said Sunday that reports of the government's 
alleged plans to prohibit use of the U.S. dollar in Russia were ``nonsense.'' 
First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said in an interview with 
the NTV television station that the state needed dollars for economic 
recovery. ``The more dollars in the country, the easier it will be 
to put the economy back on its feet,'' Maslyukov said. Russian media 
reported last week that the economic program under consideration by 
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government included many elements 
of the Soviet-era command economy. The plan leaked to the press, which 
included strict control over foreign currencies, was drafted by Maslyukov. 
Primakov has said that the government is considering several options. 
Meeting with foreign economic advisors on Saturday, he pledged to 
continue privatizing state property and appealed for more long-term 
foreign investment to help Russia fight its way out of the worst economic 
crisis since the Soviet collapse in 1991. He also stressed that the 
government had no plans to ban the circulation of U.S. dollars and 
other foreign currencies. But he said the government would take steps 
to staunch the ``dollar drain,'' the flow of dollars out of Russia. 
The Central Bank said Friday that Russian companies had stashed dlrs 
2.5 billion outside the country in September alone. In the NTV interview, 
Maslyukov said it would be ridiculous to talk of banning the dollar 
when only 20-30 percent of transactions in Russia are paid in cash 
and more than 70 percent in barter and other non-cash payments such 
as promissory notes. He said that use of another currency would help 
correct that imbalance, but did not elaborate how. ``There are no 
grounds to say anyone in this government plans to ban the use of the 
dollar, limit the import of dollars or the right of residents to buy 
or sell dollars,'' Maslyukov said. ``That is nonsense.''
