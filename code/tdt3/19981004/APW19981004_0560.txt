Reacting to the threat of a NATO strike on Yugoslavia, Russia's defense 
and foreign ministers called on President Slobodan Milosevic on Sunday, 
as his generals prepared to defend the country against attack. Foreign 
Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev met with Milosevic 
and Milan Milutinovic, president of Serbia the dominant Yugoslav republic 
that controls Kosovo. Despite Russia's opposition NATO is preparing 
for possible intervention in Serbia's southern province to end seven 
months of bloodshed. Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency reported 
that Yugoslavia's defense minister and top general had also attended, 
and that Ivanov handed Milosevic a message from Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin, but offered no details. A statement from Milosevic's 
office afterward said any NATO strike would be an ``act of aggression'' 
and asserted that in Kosovo the overall situation is ``improving daily.'' 
Russia is the Serbs' main ally, sharing bonds of religion, and joint 
Slavic roots. In Moscow, Itar-Tass carried a government statement 
again expressing opposition to any NATO intervention in Kosovo without 
the sanction of the U.N. Security Council, of which Russia is a veto-carrying 
member. ``Military interference ... would aggravate many times the 
confrontation in Kosovo and undermine diplomatic efforts'' to reestablish 
peace and dialogue, said the statement. Preparing for any attack, 
Yugoslav generals put the nation's air defense on high alert, even 
as Serbian authorities indicated they were ready for compromise by 
installing an interim government in the rebellious Serbian province. 
A Western diplomat also said that up to 120 Yugoslav army armored 
vehicles, including tanks, have been pulled out of Kosovo so far. 
The Serb side reported no fighting Sunday, beyond two attacks of civilian 
cars by Albanian ``terrorists'' about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south 
of Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital, in which one person was 
wounded. Elsewhere, a policeman was killed after stepping on a mine, 
said the Serb Media Center. But the Kosovo Information Center, which 
reports for the Albanian side, said there was heavy fighting between 
government forces and the guerrillas, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest 
of Pristina. NATO countries continued preparations. Speaking in, 9th
