The flight plan of an airplane carrying a senior Ugandan military 
official was altered after it crashed, apparently to conceal its real 
destination deep inside rebel-held Congo, a newspaper reported Sunday. 
The pilot had listed a Congolese destination in the flight plan, but 
the destination of the plane was subsequently erased and the Ugandan 
town of Kasese, 390 kilometers (245 miles) west of Kampala, was inserted, 
Sunday Vision reported. It quoted a sister of one of the passengers 
as saying the group was flying directly to Bunia in northeastern Congo 
en route to Kisangani, Congo's third largest town now controlled by 
Congolese rebels trying to oust President Laurent Kabila. The plane 
never landed in Kasese. Lt. Col. Jet Mwebaze, a brother of acting 
Chief of Staff James Kazini, was aboard the plane, and the crash of 
a plane headed deep inside rebel-held territory would have drawn attention 
to Ugandan ties with the rebels. Kabila has accused Uganda of involving 
its troops in a rebel insurgency. Uganda has strongly denied the charge. 
The twin-engine Islander, with 10 passengers, including a senior military 
official, crash-landed Sept. 25 near Kisomoro, about 60 kilometers 
(38 miles) north of Kasese, and it appeared that the disoriented survivors 
split into two groups to try to find their way out of the remote area. 
Uganda's army located five survivors Thursday and Friday. The pilot 
was killed. Mwebaze was among the four passengers missing. Other passengers 
included an Israeli, an Asian, a Congolese and several Ugandans. The 
state-owned newspaper said three of the passengers had business links 
with Kenya, Uganda and in rebel-held Congo.
