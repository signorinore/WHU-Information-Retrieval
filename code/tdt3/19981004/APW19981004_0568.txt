The government agreed on changes in its asylum policy Sunday to improve 
the treatment of refugees, after a Nigerian woman died during a deportation 
attempt two weeks ago. The center-left government left the key principles 
of its policy intact but created a special post of commissioner for 
refugee issues and gave a committee more say in which asylum seekers 
could stay. It also banned controversial deportation measures. But 
the government stuck to a core principle _ once an asylum request 
was finally turned down forced deportations would continue. It also 
rejected calls for a blanket amnesty of illegal immigrants. The government 
move came against a background of sustained protest against the current 
treatment of asylum seekers. On Sunday, over 5,000 people protested 
in Liege, 100 kilometers (65 miles) east of Brussels, demanding that 
refugees be better treated. The march was marred by skirmishes between 
police and demonstrators. Two weeks ago, Nigerian asylum seeker Semira 
Adamu, 20, died in a Brussels hospital from a brain hemorrhage, hours 
after police had stuffed a pillow over her mouth to restrain her on 
a plane which was about to depart for Africa. She became the symbol 
of inhumane treatment and Interior Minister Louis Tobback resigned 
over the incident. The head of the police unit responsible for deporting 
Adamu also stepped aside. ``Because of the dramatic death of Semira 
Adamu, there was an urgent need for need initiatives to make the policy 
more humane,'' said Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene Sunday. Government 
measures included a ban on the use of a pillow to subdue deportees, 
a standard practice up to now, and more independent outside control 
on the conditions within refugee detention centers. The government 
last week suspended the deportation of asylum seekers from Brussels 
international airport until new measures were approved. Tobback had 
resigned because a policeman who had been sanctioned for serious offenses 
against a deportee last year, was allowed to assist on Adamu's deportation 
attempt. Adamu resisted returning to Nigeria because she claimed her 
family was forcing her to marry a 65-year-old man who already has 
three wives. Belgium argued that was not sufficient to grant her refugee 
status.
