Two unidentified gunmen on Sunday held up a bus with 25 Ukrainian 
tourists aboard, robbed them of their money and jewelry, and escaped 
with a third accomplice on a waiting scooter. According to police, 
the 25 were traveling to the Ukranian capital of Kiev aboard the bus 
along with the two men. Police did not know their nationality. Authorities 
said the bus left central Athens in the early evening headed for the 
northern border with Bulgaria. Just 23 kilometers (14 miles) from 
the capital, the two men pulled out pistols, ordered the driver to 
stop the bus and robbed the passengers of an estimated dlrs 10,000 
and an unknown quantity of jewelry. An accomplice was waiting for 
them on a scooter. Police launched a manhunt, but were unable to locate 
the three men on the scooter. Although armed robberies are not rare 
in Greece, it was the first reported theft of its kind in recent memory.
