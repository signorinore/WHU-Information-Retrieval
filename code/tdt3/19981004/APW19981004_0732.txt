Ignoring pleas from authorities and the Roman Catholic Church to turn 
out for elections in troubled Chiapas state, voters opted Sunday to 
stay away in droves. Most of the 3,123 polling stations opened more 
or less on time without incident, but turnout among the southern state's 
1.9 million registered voters was extremely low. Chiapas had been 
a bastion of power for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party 
for decades, where it held sway through repression and fraud at the 
polls. But a combination of wide support among highland Indians for 
Zapatista National Liberation Army rebels; an increase in poverty 
and violence; and the feeble government response to last month's devastating 
rains and floods has eroded any support the PRI enjoyed. Bishop Arizmendi 
Esquivel of Tapachula, near the Guatemalan border, said Saturday it 
was the duty of all good Christians to vote. Despite warm weather, 
few turned out. In La Hormiga, a community of some 10,000 near San 
Cristobal de las Casas, only a score of people lined up to vote when 
the polling station opened on time Sunday at 8 a.m. Gabriel Samuel 
Gomez, 34, an unskilled worker, said he was voting for the PRI, because 
that's what he always did. But he added: ``What can you do? They're 
all the same. They promise a lot but when they get into power they 
forget about all of us poor people.'' It was the same in the big town 
of Ocosingo, in the heart of the rebel zone of influence, even though 
the Zapatistas had announced Saturday they would do nothing to interfere 
with the elections and people could do as they wished. The rebels 
staged a brief revolt in 1994 to demand democracy and better living 
conditions for the predominantly dirt-poor Indians. Hundreds have 
been killed in sporadic clashes between rebel and government sympathizers 
since then, including 45 people _ mostly women and children _ massacred 
by a pro-government paramilitary group on Dec. 22 in the village of 
Acteal. Up for election are all 40 seats of the state legislature 
and the presidents of 103 of the state's 111 counties. Elections in 
the other eight counties near the Pacific Coast were postponed until 
further notice because of flood damage. The PRI and two other big 
opposition parties _ the conservative National Action Party and the 
leftist Democratic Revolution Party _ and five other small political 
groups have fielded a total of 477 candidates.
