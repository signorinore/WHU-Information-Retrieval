Families of victims killed in the 1992 crash of an Israeli cargo plane 
tearfully marked the sixth anniversary Sunday amid new revelations 
that the jet was carrying an ingredient for nerve gas. Just meters 
(yards) from the crash site, hundreds of people gathered to remember 
the 43 people killed when the El Al Boeing jet carved a nine-story 
gash in an apartment complex on the outskirts of Amsterdam. The anguish 
triggered by the worst Dutch air disaster has began to ease, say some 
family members. But a confirmation last week by the Israeli government 
that the plane was carrying a chemical that can be used to produce 
the nerve gas sarin, has rekindled memories of that horrific crash 
on Oct. 4, 1992. ``I don't want to hear it anymore,'' said Dolene 
Johnson, who came to Sunday's memorial ceremony with her daughter. 
``Every time a new detail comes out, I have to start grieving all 
over again.'' Johnson's 24-year-old son, Ricki Tjin-Sie, was playing 
basketball with his friends in the Bijlmer neighborhood on the night 
of the crash. His body was found amid the smoldering rubble. ``He 
didn't come home and we thought he was just missing, but then came 
the dreadful news,'' said Johnson. The annual memorial ceremony began 
with a procession through the labyrinthian streets of the low-income, 
heavily immigrant neighborhood infamous for its massive apartment 
buildings. Led by Dutch Transportation Minister Tineke Netelenbos, 
families walked in silence through litter-strewn streets. Around them 
were towering apartments inhabited mostly by foreigners drawn to the 
cheap rents of the neighborhood. The procession ended at the crash 
site monument, where families laid their wreaths and muffled cries 
gave way to wails and sobs. Overcome by grief, one woman fainted and 
was treated by a first-aid worker. The ceremony also was attended 
by residents, many of whom have complained of health problems they 
said are linked to the crash. Last week, neighborhood doctors said 
some 300 residents are suffering psychiatric disorders and unspecified 
physical complaints as a result of the crash. Experts have yet to 
pin down the exact cause, but new details of the plane's ominous cargo 
have renewed calls for a comprehensive investigation. Last week, the 
Israel government acknowledged for the first time that the plane was 
carrying a chemical that can be used to produce the deadly gas sarin. 
Up to 190 liters (50 gallons) of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) 
on board the plane came from an American company in Pennsylvania and 
was headed for the Israel Institute for Biological Research in the 
Tel Aviv suburb of Nes Ziona. An Israeli government statement said 
the order had been made ``with the approval of the U.S. Department 
of Commerce for the testing of filters.'' There have also been conflicting 
reports on whether DMMP by itself is poisonous. Coinciding with the 
Israeli confirmation, the Dutch government announced it will hold 
a parliamentary inquiry to clarify exactly what was aboard the plane. 
``If this had happened in a rich area, we would have had the biggest 
investigation already,'' said Lidy Seinen, who attended the memorial 
ceremony with a friend. ``Nothing will be changed _ those people are 
dead _ but the truth must come out.''
