Arizona and Georgia are no longer sleepers. The Wildcats and Bulldogs 
muscled their way into the top 10 with impressive road victories over 
the weekend. Georgia (4-0) made the biggest leap in this week's Associated 
Press' Top 25 college football poll, moving from No. 12 to No. 7 after 
Saturday night's 28-27 win over LSU at Baton Rouge. Arizona (5-0) 
jumped four spots to No. 10 with a 31-28 victory over Washington at 
Seattle. Ohio State remained No. 1 for the fifth consecutive week 
after a 28-9 win over Penn State. The Buckeyes (4-0) were a near-unanimous 
choice, receiving 66 of the 70 first-place votes and 1,746 points 
from the 70 sports writers and broadcasters on the AP panel. Last 
week, Ohio State had 58 first-place votes and 1,737 points. Nebraska 
(5-0), with a close-call 24-17 victory over Oklahoma State, held the 
No. 2 spot with one first-place vote and 1,640 points. Last week, 
the Cornhuskers had seven first-place votes and 1,660 points. The 
rest of the Top 25 deck was shuffled a bit as UCLA (3-0), a 49-17 
winner over Washington State, moved up a spot to No. 3, while Tennessee 
(4-0) dropped a notch to No. 4 after a 17-9 win over Auburn. UCLA 
had one first-place vote and 1,575 points. Kansas State (4-0), which 
did not play on Saturday, remained No. 5 with two first-place votes 
and 1,519 points, followed by No. 6 Florida, No. 7 Georgia, No. 8 
Florida State, No. 9 Virginia and No. 10 Arizona. Florida (4-1) used 
a 16-10 win over Alabama to jump two spots, while Penn State, ranked 
No. 7 last week, fell to No. 13 after its loss at Ohio State. LSU 
dropped five places to No. 11, followed by No. 12 Wisconsin, No. 13 
Penn State, No. 14 Colorado, No. 15 Oregon, No. 16 West Virginia, 
No. 17 Virginia Tech, No. 18 Texas A-and-M, No. 19 USC and No. 20 
Arkansas. Missouri was No. 21, followed by No. 22 Notre Dame, No. 
23 North Carolina State, No. 24 Syracuse and No. 25 Tulane. In the 
USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, the top five were Ohio State, Nebraska, 
UCLA, Kansas State and Tennessee. Tulane, 4-0 after a 21-7 win over 
Southern Mississippi made the Top 25 for the first time since Dec. 
3, 1979. NC State (3-1), a 38-17 winner over Syracuse last Thursday 
night, rejoined the rankings for the second time this season. Washington 
and Michigan fell out of the Top 25.
