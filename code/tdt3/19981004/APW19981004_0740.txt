Sudan on Sunday demanded a postponement of talks on renewing a cease-fire 
agreement with rebels due to fighting in the south. Gen. Hassan Dahawi, 
the state minister for social planning, accused the rebels of using 
the three-month cease-fire to shift its forces to Eastern Equatoria, 
the scene of current fighting, the Sudan News Agency reported Sunday. 
The cease-fire ends on Oct. 15. Sudan called for a postponement of 
the talks ``because the time was not suitable due to fighting currently 
taking place,'' the agency quoted Dahawi as saying. The talks were 
to be held Monday in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, under the auspices 
of the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development. Sudan 
says the rebel offensive, which began on Sept. 14, aims to capture 
the provincial town of Juba, about 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) south 
of Khartoum. Rebels say they attacked government positions because 
the Sudanese air force was bombing civilian targets in rebel-held 
areas. Juba is the largest town in southern Sudan under government 
control. Dahawi also accused two of IGAD's members, Uganda and Eritrea, 
of aiding the main rebel group, the Sudan People's Liberation Army, 
in carrying out the offensive. The postponement of the talks cut hopes 
among aid agencies and donors that the three-month cease-fire to facilitate 
aid efforts would be extended. The government says the cease-fire 
applies to all of the south, while the rebels insist it is restricted 
only to Bahr el-Ghazal, where famine is widespread. Last month, the 
European Union said it hoped the cease-fire would not only be extended 
but also expanded to cover other provinces where aid is needed. The 
15-year civil war often has led to famine because rebels or government-backed 
militia burn or steal crops to deny food to their enemies. Some 1.5 
million people have died in the fighting and famines.
