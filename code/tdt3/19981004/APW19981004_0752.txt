French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine was meeting Sunday night with 
his British counterpart to discuss the situation in Kosovo where threats 
of a NATO strike loom, the Foreign Ministry said. A ministry spokesman, 
speaking on customary condition of anonymity, provided no details 
on the meeting between Vedrine and Robin Cook. The encounter was preceded 
by a lengthy telephone conversation between Vedrine and U.S. Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright, the spokesman said. Tension surrounding 
an eventual NATO strike was mounting as Western leaders sought a way 
to force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to halt attacks on 
ethnic Albanians and seek a political settlement to the Kosovo problem. 
Britain has said it will send four more ground-attack aircraft to 
a NATO base in southern Italy on Monday, doubling the number of Royal 
Air Force planes there in readiness for an attack on Kosovo. British 
Defense Secretary George Robertson said in a British Broadcasting 
Corp. television interview Sunday that ``a whole series of options 
have been worked through and that we are ready to move on them.'' 
France is not a member of NATO's military wing, but is nevertheless 
consulted.
