Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten won the dlrs 475,000 Mallorca ATP clay court 
tennis tournament Sunday, beating the favorite Carlos Moya of Spain 
in three sets. World No. 5 Moya took the first set 7-6, winning 7-5 
on the tiebreak, before losing the next two sets to the Brazilian 
6-2, 6-3. The two hours and four minute match disappointed the crowd 
that had packed into the local bullfighting ring on this Mediterranean 
island to support Moya _ a local hero. ``I like to play with that 
kind of pressure because it motivates me, while on the other hand 
I think it made Moya a bit nervous,'' Kuerten told reporters after 
the match. The Kuerten-Moya final was billed as duel between two Roland 
Garros champions, the Brazilian from 1997 and the Spaniard this year's 
winner. The tournament's doubles finals pitting Pablo Albano and Daniel 
Orsanic of Argentina against Jiri Novak and David Riki of the Czech 
Republic was called off because of rain. The organizers said the final 
would be played next week during the Palermo Open, the next ATP competition.
