Frank Pogson, a former British naval officer who married into one 
of Rome's most important noble families and helped open up the family's 
15th century palace to the public, has died in Rome. The Doria Pamphili 
family said Pogson, 75, died Friday in Rome. He had suffered from 
ill health for some time. After marrying Princess Orietta in London 
in 1958 and moving to Rome, Pogson took the initiative of opening 
up for public visiting hours the family's private apartments in Doria 
Pamphili palace, an complex of buildings near central Piazza Venezia 
with a base dating from the early 15th century and later, upper Baroque 
floors. He also worked to restore the palace gallery, one of Rome's 
most important private art collections which reopened two years ago 
to the public, allowing them to see masterpieces from artists such 
as Titian, Caravaggio and Velazquez. Marble busts and intricately 
mirrored rooms are among the highlights. Pogson and the princess met 
in a church in Ancona, an Italian seaport on the Adriatic, towards 
the end of World War II when she asked him what time it was. She was 
doing volunteer work to help Allied troops. He was serving in the 
British Navy. Born in Maidenhead, England, in 1923, Pogson went on 
to study history, one of his passions. He was active in philanthropy, 
including involvement with a home for the elderly poor in Rome, and 
made sure that some of the rooms of the family's palace in the port 
city of Genoa were given to sailors at low rent. Pogson is survived 
by his wife, son Jonathan and daughter Gesine and a sister, Margaret. 
The funeral was scheduled for Monday in the family's parish church, 
The Apostle Saints, which dates back to the 6th century.
