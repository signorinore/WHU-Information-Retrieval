French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine met Sunday night with his British 
counterpart to discuss the situation in Kosovo where threats of a 
NATO strike loom, the Foreign Ministry said. A ministry spokesman, 
speaking on customary condition of anonymity, provided no details 
on the meeting between Vedrine and Robin Cook. The encounter was preceded 
by a lengthy telephone conversation between Vedrine and U.S. Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright, the spokesman said. Vedrine and Cook 
were discussing ``the decisions that are to be made on this dossier,'' 
the spokesman said, refusing to elaborate. Tension surrounding an 
eventual NATO strike was mounting as Western leaders sought a way 
to force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to halt attacks on 
ethnic Albanians seeking greater autonomy for Kosovo province and 
find a political settlement to the crisis. Britain has said it will 
send four more ground-attack aircraft to a NATO base in southern Italy 
on Monday, doubling the number of Royal Air Force planes there in 
readiness for an attack on Kosovo. Prime Minister Tony Blair's Cabinet 
meets Monday to formally approve the use of force unless Milosevic 
backs down. Also Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is to deliver 
his own assessment to the Security Council on whether Belgrade is 
complying with U.N. demands to halt its assault on ethnic Albanians. 
If not, Washington has indicated that NATO air attacks will come within 
two weeks. France, active in seeking a solution to the Kosovo crisis, 
is not a member of NATO's military wing, but is nevertheless consulted.
