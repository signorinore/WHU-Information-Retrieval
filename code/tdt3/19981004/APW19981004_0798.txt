Champion Haka of Valkeakoski lost 1-0 away to VPS Vaasa Sunday in 
the last round of the Finnish soccer championship. Haka finished on 
48 points from 27 games, and VPS took the silver medals with 45 points. 
Haka, coached by Briton Keith Armstrong, secured the title the week 
before, as the third promoted team ever in Finland to be crowned champion. 
The bronze went to another league newcomer, PK-35 of Helsinki, coached 
by former German Bundesliga pro Pasi Rautiainen. The fate of the lesser 
medals, and the UEFA Cup qualifying spot to go with second place, 
was open to the very end. Haka pressed to score against VPS, and PK-35 
went forward in search of a winning goal against HJK in a local tie. 
The 1-1-result had PK-35 finishing on 44 points, one point behind 
VPS. This year's winning coach Armstrong is immensely popular in Finnish 
soccer after a stint as a studio commentator on national TV during 
the World Cup in France. Armstrong, 40, who hails from Corbridge, 
west of Newcastle in north-eastern England, has lived in Finland for 
19 years, winning three championship titles as a player. The British 
forward gained back-to-back gold with OPS of Oulu in 1979 and 1980, 
and also won with Kuusysi of Lahti in 1984. ``I scored at Anfield 
Road against Liverpool (for OPS) in the European Cup. It was great, 
but we lost 10-1,'' Armstrong said. As a coach, Armstrong led Haka 
to the promotion last year, and added the Cup title as well. But in 
this year's Cup winners' cup Haka was ousted last week by Panionios 
of Greece in the first round on an aggregate score of 5-1.
