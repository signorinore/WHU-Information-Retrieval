Champion Haka of Valkeakoski lost 1-0 away to VPS Vaasa Sunday in 
the last round of the season, but still took the Finnish soccer championship. 
Haka finished with 48 points in 27 games while VPS took the silver 
medal with 45 points. Haka, coached by Briton Keith Armstrong, secured 
the title last week, becoming only the third promoted team in Finland 
to be crowned champion. The bronze went to another league newcomer, 
PK-35 of Helsinki, coached by former German Bundesliga pro Pasi Rautiainen. 
Second and third place, as well as the UEFA Cup qualifying spot that 
goes with second place, were up for grabs to the very end. PK-35 tied 
1-1 against HJK, ending the season with 44 points, only one behind 
VPS. Armstrong is immensely popular in Finnish soccer after a stint 
as a studio commentator on national TV during the World Cup in France. 
Armstrong, 40, who hails from Corbridge, in northeastern England, 
has lived in Finland for 19 years, winning three championship titles 
as a player. He gained back-to-back golds with OPS of Oulu in 1979 
and 1980, and also won with Kuusysi of Lahti in 1984. ``I scored at 
Anfield Road against Liverpool (for OPS) in the European Cup. It was 
great, but we lost 10-1,'' Armstrong said. As a coach, Armstrong led 
Haka to the promotion last year, and added the Cup title as well. 
But in this year's Cup Winners' Cup, Haka was ousted last week by 
Panionios of Greece in the first round on an aggregate score of 5-1.
