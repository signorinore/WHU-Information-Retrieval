Wes Smith's broom-handled putter carried him to a one-stroke victory 
in the PGA Senior Club Professional Championship on Sunday. Closing 
out a 4-under-par 68 by sinking an 18-foot (5.5-meter) putt on the 
18th hole, the 53-year-old teaching pro in Hollywood, Florida, birdied 
four of the final six holes. Smith had a 4-under-par 284 for the four 
rounds, a shot better than Tommy Price of Hickory, North Carolina. 
Price shot a 70 on Sunday. Dick McClean of Kapalua, Hawaii, and Michael 
Zinni of Mankato, Minnesota, tied for third at 286 after closing with 
a 72 and 73, respectively. McLean led by two strokes through 13 holes 
before a double bogey at the par-4 14th hole and a bogey at the par-3 
16th.
