Andrew Musuva of Kenya won the Twin Cities Marathon on Sunday for 
the second straight year and Zinaida Semenova of Russia captured the 
women's division. On a cold day in which winds reached 20 mph (32 
kph), Musuva was timed in 2 hours, 15 minutes and 19 seconds _ 20 
seconds off his 1997 time. ``I stayed in the pack as long as possible 
to have others break the wind,'' Musuva said. ``Just like last year, 
I wanted to be patient. I decided to go hard about 22 miles and take 
the lead. I've been training in hot weather (in New Mexico), and I'm 
not too crazy about the cold.'' Andrey Kuznetsov, a 40-year-old Russian, 
was second in the field of 7,500 runners, finishing in 2:15:36. Semenova, 
running her first Twin Cities Marathon, broke away from Russian compatriot 
Alina Ivanova halfway through the 26.2-mile (42.2-kilometer) race 
and won in 2:32:06. Ivanova, second at Twin Cities in 1995 and sixth 
in 1996, was timed in 2:34:04. ``It was very lonely out there,'' Semenova 
said. ``The wind was just too strong to be running by yourself. I'm 
not thrilled with my time and had hoped to get under 2:30, but that's 
the best you can expect with these conditions.'' Bev Docherty, 40, 
of St. Paul, won the women's masters division in 2:43:23 and placed 
seventh overall. Mexico's Saul Mendoza won the men's wheelchair division 
for the third straight year.
