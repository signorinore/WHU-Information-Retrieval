Brazil and France will square off in the opening match of the Mexico 
1999 Confederations Cup, a highly anticipated sequel to the 1998 World 
Cup final in which the French hosts defeated the soccer-loving Brazilians. 
``Brazil doesn't have a chance,'' French coach Henri Emile joked following 
Sunday's draw for the Jan. 8-20 tournament. The opening game is to 
be held in Guadalajara's Jalisco stadium, where the French beat Brazil 
in the 1986 World Cup. The draw was presided over by FIFA Sports Director 
Walter Gagg and CONCACAF President Jack Warner.
