Bayern Munich players Mario Basler and Lothar Matthaeus Sunday joined 
striker Olaf Marschall in pulling out of Germany's upcoming Euro 2000 
qualifiers against Turkey and Moldova. Basler is suffering from a 
rib injury and won't be available for the Oct. 10 match in Turkey 
and four days later in Moldova, his club said Sunday. Matthaeus, tore 
a muscle later Sunday in a match against Borussia Dortmund, adding 
to the growing injury worries for new German coach Erich Ribbeck. 
``I suppose this proves you should never decide too early on a starting 
lineup,'' he said. Marschall, the Kaiserslautern striker who is Bundesliga's 
leading scorer with seven goals, said Saturday he had to miss the 
two matches because of a strained tendon and bruised heel. Ribbeck, 
who will make his debut in the Turkey match, also may be forced to 
do without expected starter Ulf Kirsten, who is still recovering from 
a bruise. The Bayer Leverkusen forward, who received his injury during 
Tuesday's UEFA Cup match against Udinese, missed Saturday's Bundesliga 
match against Kaiserslautern. Marschall, third on the national team's 
forward depth chart behind Oliver Bierhoff and Kirsten, left the match 
early because of his injuries after scoring his seventh goal in a 
2-2 draw. Ribbeck will also be without Bayern Munich defensive midfielder 
Thomas Strunz, who is recovering from leg surgery. The absence of 
Strunz and Basler will force Ribbeck to rebuild the right side of 
his lineup, with Jens Jeremies of Bayern Munich and Lars Ricken of 
Borussia Dortmund likely to move in. But Ribbeck said Sunday he may 
consider building his revamped squad around Munich and Leverkusen 
players, with newcomer Carsten Ramelow and Stefan Beinlich from the 
latter club filling the right side.
