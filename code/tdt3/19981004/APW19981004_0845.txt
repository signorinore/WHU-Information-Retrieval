Steve Elkington, coming from four shots back in regulation Sunday, 
parred the first playoff hole of the Buick Challenge to beat Fred 
Funk, who had led the first three days of the dlrs 1.5 million tournament. 
Elkington, sidelined for a month earlier this year with a bout with 
viral meningitis, shot a 5-under-par 65 for a 267 to tie Funk, who 
had a 68 in the final round over the par 72, 7,057-yard (6,451-meter) 
Mountain View course at the Callaway Gardens resort 75 miles (120 
kilometers) southwest of Atlanta. On the first playoff hole _ the 
par 4, 432-yard (395-meter) 18th hole, Funk hit into a fairway bunker, 
184 yards (168 meters) from the pin. His second shot hit the lip of 
the bunker and caromed into the fairway about 20 yards (18 meters) 
sideways, and his third shot landed in the deep rough, five yards 
(4.5 meters) off the green _ all before Elkington's second shot. Funk's 
fourth shot landed 8 feet (2.4 meters) beyond the pin. Elkington's 
second shot was in the middle of the green, and he calmly two-putted 
for his par and the ninth win of his career, the first since last 
year when he won the Doral-Ryder Open and Players's Championship. 
It was his second victory here, the first coming in four years ago. 
The dlrs 270,000 first prize gave Elkington dlrs 695,000 for the year 
in 15 events and raised his career earnings to more than dlrs 7 million. 
Bill Glasson shot a 69 and finished third at 268, one shot behind 
the leaders. J.L. Lewis had a 68 and was another shot back at 269. 
Skip Kendall, who had the day's best round with a 63, was next at 
271. Leading money-winner David Duval was another two shots back at 
273 after a 69. Elkington had seven birdies without a bogey in his 
round, including five birdies on the back nine, highlighted by a 15-footer 
(4.6-meter) on 18 for the tie. Funk, seeking a wire-to-wire victory 
on one of his favorite courses. He has had five tour wins, including 
one earlier this year at the Deposit Guaranty Classic. The field has 
19 of the top 30 money-winners, including Vijay Singh, the PGA champion, 
and defending champion Davis Love. Singh had a final-round 74 for 
283. Love had a 65-275. Hal Sutton, the winner of the Texas Open last 
week, had a 69-274.
