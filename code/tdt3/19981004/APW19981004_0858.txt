Gil Morgan rallied from four shots back with a final-round 5-under-par 
65 Sunday to win the dlrs 1.5 million Vantage Championship. Morgan's 
12-under-par 198 total earned him dlrs 225,000 as he edged Hale Irwin, 
who shot a 67, by one shot on the par-70, 6,600-yard (6,033-meter) 
Tanglewood Park championship course. It was the second major comeback 
win of the season on the PGA Senior Tour for Morgan. He came from 
five shots back in February to win the LG Championship. Meanwhile, 
Irwin has two wins and two seconds in his last four Vantage tournaments. 
Morgan tied Irwin, the leading money winner on the tour, with his 
sixth victory of 1998. Jerry McGee, who started the day with a three-shot 
lead, tied for third with Tom Wargo, two shots back. Wargo moved into 
contention late with a third-round 64, while McGee birdied the final 
hole to salvage a 1-over 71 after a disastrous triple bogey on the 
15th hole. Morgan's win was his 13th on the tour _ six more than his 
entire total on the PGA Tour over a 24-year span. Morgan did finish 
second or third 41 times on the regular tour. McGee was clinging to 
a one-shot lead over Morgan and a two-stroke margin over Irwin and 
had just saved par on the 14th hole with a 20-foot (6-meter) putt 
after escaping two sand traps. But then disaster struck. McGee, who 
has had trouble off the tee all season, hooked his drive into the 
lake on the 15th hole and three-putted for a triple bogey as his attempt 
for his first Senior Tour title went up in smoke. Meanwhile, Morgan, 
playing in the group ahead of McGee and Irwin, took the lead for good 
with a 15-foot (4.6-meter) birdie putt on the 16th. Terry Dill tied 
the course record with a 62 and finished at 8-under. Dill birdied 
five of the opening six holes Sunday to beat his career-best round 
by two shots. Irwin and Dave Eichelberger set the Tanglewood 18-hole 
record last year when the course played to a par-71. Dill's 62 was 
10 shots better than his second-round score and also tied the low 
round on the Senior Tour this season. Irwin has a pair of 62s, while 
Jay Sigel and Isao Aoki also posted that score. None were on par-70 
courses.
