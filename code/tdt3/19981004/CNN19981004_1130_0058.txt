The house Judiciary committee on Monday is expected to vote on whether 
there should be a formal impeachment inquiry of President Clinton. 
If it approves formal hearings, a full house vote on the matter could 
come by Friday. Mr. Clinton, the first lady and Chelsea are spending 
the weekend at camp David. Back in Washington, the question remains, 
how long the impeachment process should last. Polls show the public 
wants a quick resolution of the matter. Democrats and republicans 
are proposing their own deadlines. There is no one in the world who 
wants to close this down quicker than I. there may be some who want 
to close it as quick as I, but not quicker. But I would think that's 
a little optimistic. It depends on cooperation. If we get cooperation 
from the democrats. If they will produce witnesses and records and 
even stipulate to certain things, we could short-circuit a lot of 
this. But I have a new year's resolution, and that is we finish by 
new year's. You know how new year's resolutions sometimes get broken, 
but it's my hope and prayer that we can finish by new year's. This 
is Starr's fifth year in this report and $40 million. The public is 
up to here. And all the democrats on the committee say is this -- 
"let's put a timetable around this." Let's investigate by or around 
Thanksgiving and get this thing through. Henry Hyde says he will be 
done by the end of the year. Is that acceptable? He has told you that. 
He hasn't told me that. And we may be able to work that out.
