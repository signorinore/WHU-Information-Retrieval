America's family farmers say they're on the brink of disaster. Speaking 
at farm aid '98, farm leaders say failed federal policies have set 
the stage for forcing thousands of families off their farms. Dozens 
of artists joined farm aid founder Willie Nelson yesterday for the 
annual concert outside Chicago. Farmers say commodity prices are the

every bushel of corn they raise and $40 on every hog.
