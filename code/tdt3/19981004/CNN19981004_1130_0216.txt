The world's leading industrialized powers are endorsing a plan to 
ease the economic crisis gripping Asia and Russia. Treasury secretary 
Robert Rubin and federal reserve chairman Alan Greenspan represented 
the U.S. at yesterday's meeting in Washington of finance ministers 
from members of the G-7. The group issued a statement stressing the 
need for cooperation, but said details will be worked out later. Members 
agreed in principle to many of President Clinton's proposals, including 
allowing the international monetary fund to provide more money faster 
to countries threatened by fleeing investors.
