About 6,000 Russians marched through the streets of Moscow today to 
Mark the fifth anniversary of a coup attempt by the Soviet-era parliament. 
Jill Dougherty reports. It was a somber March, more like a funeral 
procession, in memory of the more than 100 people who died during 
the attempted coup against President Boris Yeltsin in 1993. Five years 
later, grief and anger remain. "If you ask me whether I lost anyone 
in that day, I'd say, yes, it was my country that I lost," she says. 
"All those people who were killed and whose portraits are behind me 
were my friends and my compatriots." This March takes place in the 
midst of economic and political crisis, yet virtually no one here 
says they want a return to the violence and bloodshed of five years 
ago. We are against bloodshed, this woman says. It was the Yeltsin 
government that was gunning us down, and now it's making fools of 
us. Communists aren't just the proletariat, we're educated people. 
Communists and trade unionists are planning what they say will be 
massive anti-government demonstrations across Russia, Wednesday. The 
head of the communist party, Gennady Zyuganov, says they're doing 
everything possible to avoid any disturbances. Any time there's been 
violence, it's been provoked by the executive power, by Yeltsin and 
his gang, he says. They generated disorder. We will ensure order and 
safety. As preparations for the March continue, striking miners from 
Russia's far north, who've been camped out for four months behind 
Russian government headquarters in Moscow, say they're ending their 
protest. Some, however, say they won't go. Let them shoot at me. I 
have no way out. It is either to die here or die there, in the north, 
from hunger, he says. After his Sunday March, the communist leader 
visited the miners' camp. He says they're not leaving, that the demonstrations 
next Wednesday will be in support of the miners' and other workers' 
demands. Jill Dougherty, CNN, Moscow.
