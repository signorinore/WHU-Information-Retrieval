Britain's defense secretary says NAto may have to put troops on the 
ground in Kosovo to enforce any settlement between Serbia and the 
region's ethnic Albanians. But he refused to comment on a report in 
"the Sunday telegraph" that Britain is considering sending several 
thousand troops with tanks. The United States and Britain are threatening 
air strikes against Serbian targets if Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic does not stop the violence against Albanians there. Russia 
says air strikes against the Serbs are not a good idea. In a statement, 
the Russian government said strikes would be a "flagrant breach" of 
United Nations rules if NATO does not first get approval from the 
security council. Russian authorities also say military intervention 
would only deepen the conflict and undermine efforts to get the two 
sides to negotiate.
