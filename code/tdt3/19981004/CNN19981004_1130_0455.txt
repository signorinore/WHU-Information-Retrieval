Authorities are investigating the attempted bombing of two women's 
clinics in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The bureau of alcohol, tobacco 
and firearms says an unidentified caller told authorities there was 
a suspicious package outside one clinic yesterday. Officials found 
a bomb made of several sticks of dynamite near the front door of the 
clinic. As a precaution, they checked another clinic three miles away 
and also found an explosive device there. Both clinics were the target 
of arson last month. Authorities described the bombs as potentially 
deadly.
