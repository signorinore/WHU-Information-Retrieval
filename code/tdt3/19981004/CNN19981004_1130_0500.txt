the Rockies and the plains, generating a chance of heavy rain and 
some snow in the region. Also watch a low-pressure system across portions 
of the gulf, bring rain showers to the upper Texas coast, into Louisiana. 
And rain gradually spreads across the deep south, as a cold front 
moves in from the west. We'll also look for increasing showers, stretching 
from Oklahoma and Texas, into the Great Lakes. High pressure loosens 
its grip on the northeast, so cloudier skies and a chance of rain 
enters the forecast during the workweek. Look for a Ridge of high 
pressure across the west. Western temperatures will be in the 40s 
and 50s, with 60s, 70s and 80s expected for the southwest and much 
of the east.p portions of Texas will see temperatures in the 90s.
