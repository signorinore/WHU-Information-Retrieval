Hollywood is remembering a child actor who left Britain and became 
an award-winning star in television, film and theater. Roddy McDowall 
died of cancer yesterday at his California home. McDowall first emerged 
as a star in the John Ford film "how green was my valley." He may 
be best known for his role as cornelius in "the planet of the apes" 
and its sequels. Elizabeth Taylor, who co-starred with him in "lassie 
come home," said she is shocked and grieving. McDowall, who was also 
an accomplished photographer with five books to his credit, was 70 
years old.
