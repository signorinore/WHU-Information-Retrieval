The federal government has a plan to put the "guard" back in guardrail. 
As Ed Garsten reports, the goal is to save more lives. 42,000 people 
die on the nation's roads each year according to the federal government. 
About a third of those deaths were caused by so-called "run off the 
road" type accidents where a car or truck leaves the roadway. Now, 
new federal regulations will require stronger guardrails and barriers 
be used on new and reconstructed roads to help reduce the number of 
fatalities. New barriers must better control the G-force occupants 
feel after impact, reducing the risk of injury. The new regulations 
also require the barriers be built to accommodate today's popular 
sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, which sit higher. Older 
barriers were built with lower profile cars in mind. When a car strikes 
this barrier it's guided back onto the roadway. Damage to the car 
is minimal. When a pickup truck hits this shock absorbing guardrail 
at about 60 miles an hour, the guardrail collapses. There was no intrusion, 
no cracked windshield and almost drivable away. The federal highway 
administer says the death toll has decreased some 30% in the last 
ten years but he says that's still not good enough. With these new 
regulations, the government simply wants to increase the margin between 
damage and death. Ed Garsten, CNN, Detroit.
