Industry experts say traveling by plane could become very different 
by the next decade. Lori Waffenschmidt explains in this edition of 
"working ahead." Americans are taking flight more than ever before. 
Aaa says nearly twice as many people will be flying ten years from 
now, making airports more crowded and airline seats harder to find. 
And aaa is predicting that increased competition for seats will prompt 
airlines to do away with economy fares. According to aaa, air travel 
increased over 30% between 1987 and 1997. The report is based on federal 
aviation administration numbers forecasting about 900 million airline 
passengers in the year 2007. In December, Delta air lines begins phasing 
out first-class service on intercontinental flights in favor of an 
upscale business class. Delta says customer surveys indicate more 
passengers want souped-up business class than would pay for first 
class. Delta's move follows airlines such as continental, U.S. airways 
and virgin atlantic, all offering premium business class instead of 
first class on various intercontinental routes. But Delta may offer 
frequent fliers a break on redeeming miles. Delta's gonna stay Pat 
at the business class award level, which means it's a better value, 
getting a better product for the same amount of miles. Have pet, will 
travel. Once again, animals can travel as cargo on Delta and united 
airlines. Both carriers temporarily banned transportation of animals 
as cargo during the summer months, due to extremely hot temperatures 
in cargo holds. But fido may only have a short time to fly. As winter 
approaches, some airlines may ban travel due to cold weather. Lori 
Waffenschmidt, CNN, reporting.
