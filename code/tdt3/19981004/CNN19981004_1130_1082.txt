"Headline Sports" is next. Boundaries. From the very beginning... 
we have resented them. So what happens? Some of us grow up to be business 
people and what do we face? More boundaries! The telecommunications 
boundaries that separate local from long distance, voice from data, 
domestic from global. And force you to accept separate carriers, separate 
networks, a blizzard of bills. Ah, but these is a way through those 
barriers. Right through... here. The port of entry to a seamless global 
network that lets you have one carrier, one contact, one Bill. And 
makes it seem as though the old boundaries no longer exist. Because 
for you, they won't. On-net. From MCI Worldcom. I didn't need a wimpy 
laptop. I needed a desktop that travels. They said, "do you like movies?" 
and I said "are you talking to me?" Introducing your:)ware technology 
that grows with you. When you cl 1-800-gateway we can custom-build 
you a portable desktop with an Intel Pentium II processor and a dvd 
drive for movies. All for just $87 a month. And in two years you can 
trade it in toward the purchase of a new one. : I love this part. 
: me too. Call us, and let's talk about Your:)Ware from Gateway.
