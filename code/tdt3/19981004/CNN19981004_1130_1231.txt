Matt Yallof, "Headline Sports." If you don't think pitching and defense 
win playoff games, think again. Kevin brown came back on three days' 
rest and outdueled Mike Hampton for a 2-1 win. Tony Gwynn chipped 
in with stellar "D," cutting down moises alou at third, and Jim leyritz 
came through with his fifth career postseason homer. Came off Scott 
ellerton. And Trevor Hoffman finished things off. San Diego leads 
the series two games to one. That was a slider that was down, and 
like I said, I'm looking fastball the whole time, 'cause they told 
me he throws hard. It's the first time I've ever seen him, too. And, 
like I said, I just guessed right. And like I said, I wasn't trying 
to hit a home run. I was just swinging, and I was fortunate to hit 
it out. Game four tonight. Randy Johnson versus sterling hitchcock. 
One more win and the padres return to the nlcs for the first time 
in 14 years. The Braves are in the nlcs for the seventh time in eight 
years. Atlanta completed the sweep of Chicago with a 6-2 win. Greg 
Maddux allowed two runs over seven, and Eddie Perez cracked a grand 
slam. The magical season for Sammy Sosa comes to an end. 1998, nobody 
gonna forget it. It's been an unbelievable year. But, you know, I 
gotta get ready for 1999, so I'll have to say to myself, "I'm going 
to go home, relax and work hard." In the American league -- the Indians 
return to the league championship series for the third time in four 
years. They'll face the Yankees. David justice with a game-winning 
two-run double in the eighth. 2-1, your final. Cleveland beats the 
red sox in four. Game one Tuesday in the Bronx.
