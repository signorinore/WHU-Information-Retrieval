They're the lovable losers who charmed Saturday nights. Now they're 
chasing their dreams on the big screen. Lauren Sydney reports. hey! 
oh! ooh! So, anyways -- you guys want to make out or what? They are 
two wild and crazy guys, Steve and Doug butabi, and they spend their 
nights trying to catch the foxes. You're brothers? no! Yes, man! One 
thing's for certain, the brothers have scored big with fans on "Saturday 
night live." The head-bopping club hoppers were born from the observations 
of comedians will Ferrell and Chris kattan. We were out with a bunch 
of friends, just at a dance club, and yeah, I just saw this guy just 
kind of just like by himself, just, like, you know, checking out the 
room. He was, you know, scoping the place, bopping slightly to the 
music, not to the extreme that we do. He's there, and he had the, 
"do you want to dance with me? Somebody want to dance with me? Please, 
someone, dance with me." Hey, you from out of town? Hey, you from 
out of town? You from out of town? Yeah! For the brothers butabi, 
every night is Saturday night when you've got the fever. You can tell 
by the way I use my walk One of them thinks he is the handsome one, 
and one of them thinks he's the smart one, and they're both wrong. 
Which is kind of the truth. But one thing the brothers have going 
for them is they refuse to take no for an answer. I don't know if 
they ever even hear the words or know the word rejection. They're 
kind of, when a girl says no to them, it's kind of like, "all right, 
take it easy. Who's next?" But even lovable losers can realize their 
dream of being as cool as Richard Grieco for a night, if they can 
just somehow find a way to get into L.A.'s hottest club, the Roxbury. 
Whoa, excuse me. See you later, Grieco! Later, Richard! They're sure 
that something good will happen, even though there's no reason why 
they should even think that. To prepare for their roles, the comic 
duo bopped all over the L.A. club scene. Yeah, we've been doing research. 
What happened last night? Where are my pants? We did research! We're 
like, "honestly, we're doing research for this movie," and "please 
let us in." And they're like, "back -- back of the line." We're going 
to go wait in line. Maybe we'll Hang out later? There's no chance 
of that happening. Sounds good. Laurin Sydney, "CNN Entertainment 
News," New York.
