"Headline News," I'm Kate snow. It could be a day of judgment for 
President Clinton. Tomorrow, the house Judiciary committee will debate 
whether to launch impeachment proceedings against him. The president 
and the first lady took time off at camp David, while republicans 
and democrats spent the weekend staking out their agendas. Republicans 
are asking for an open-ended inquiry into whether the president's 
behavior merits impeachment. Democrats want a Thanksgiving deadline 
on the hearing and hope to limit it to the Monica Lewinsky matter. 
Committee chairman Henry Hyde says he hopes to finish the inquiry 
by year's end, and won't accept democratic demands for a time limit. 
This is a very simple, straightforward case. Everyone in America understands 
what this is about. Children understand what this is about. This is 
about illicit sex out of marriage, and lying about it. There's not 
a whole lot more evidence that's going to shed more light on it. So 
as of today, this moment, October, early October, the Congress of 
the United States has a set of facts facing it. An extraordinary, 
complete record. And we could make a very rapid judgment about whether 
this rises to the level of an impeachable offense, and if so, what 
we want to do about it.
