Yugoslavia is vowing to defend itself against any NATO intervention 
in the Kosovo conflict. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic met 
his defense council today after emergency talks with Russian government 
envoys. NAto is threatening military action unless Milosevic brings 
an end to violence in Kosovo. Thousands of ethnic Albanians have been 
camped out in the mountains for three months, seeking refuge from 
attacks by Serbian troops. One observer, a reporter for "the New York 
Times," says the ethnic conflict in Kosovo could have a widespread 
impact. Unlike Bosnia, which was an independent state, Kosovo is considered 
part of Serbia, and no one in the west wants these ethnic Albanians 
to win their independence. They are afraid it will throw the whole 
region into turmoil, because if the Albanians in Kosovo get independence, 
what happens to the Albanians in Macedonia? What happens in parts 
of Bulgaria? There is really a deep concern that the long-standing 
nationalist hatreds -- ethnic tensions in this part of the world, 
which led to world war I in the first place -- could start again. 
Senate majority leader Trent Lott says the United States is not prepared 
for military action in Kosovo three weeks before election day. Lott 
says he finds it "curious" that NAto wants to take action now that 
"the damage has been done." He says he's concerned the Clinton administration 
has no real plan in place.
