Secretary of state Madeleine Albright is scheduled to arrive in the 
mideast Tuesday. It's part of a continuing effort to move the peace 
process forward. Walter Rodgers tells us what she can expect. This 
is the mood on streets, as U.S. secretary of state Albright prepares 
to try to advance the Israeli/Palestinian peace talks -- Palestinians 
locked out of jobs. Israel has again sealed its borders, total closure. 
The intelligence information we have is extremely serious of the intentions 
of the Hamas to inflict a major terrorist blow against us. These daily 
clashes are a reminder to secretary Albright that, though she's coming 
to talk about peace, it is really an Israeli/Palestinian disengagement 
she is negotiating amid continuing hostility and suspicion. This summit 
can be a success if the Palestinians live up to their obligations, 
show a commitment to carry out, in concrete terms, their obligations. 
I think the man doesn't believe in land for peace. I think the man 
doesn't believe that the Palestinians should exist. Still, meetings 
continue to affect a further Israeli/Palestinian disengagement before 
secretary Albright arrives. An agreement in principle to hand over 
13% of the West Bank to the Palestinians has already been agreed to 
after months of wrangling. Security from attacks by militant Islamic 
fundamentalists, so long a sticking point for the Israelis, may now 
also be close to a deal. The American plan, the working plan for working 
against the terrorist organizations, is something that if the Palestinians 
follow will change the whole landscape here, as far as terrorism is 
concerned. What's missing now is the political will to close another 
Israeli/Palestinian disengagement agreement. Secretary Albright's 
coming to nudge the sides closer together, but analysts caution, even 
a mid-October White House summit will have its limits. It's quite 
possible that after we will declare a breakthrough in the peace process 
and the process is back on track. When they get down to implementing 
it, we'll find out that the distrust between the two sides, the fact 
that they don't believe each other, is still the more important fact 
of Middle East, and that there won't be implementation, and we'll 
be back where we started from. These are but some of the realities 
secretary Albright faces as she comes this week, representing a president 
badly in need of a foreign policy success before next month's congressional 
elections. Walter Rodgers, CNN, Jerusalem.
