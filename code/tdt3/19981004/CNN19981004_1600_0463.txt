African-American activists will head to the steps of the Supreme Court 
tomorrow, as the justices begin their new session. The group plans 
to protest the lack of minority law clerks working at the high court. 
Of the 34 currently serving, only one is nonwhite. Law clerks help 
decide which cases the justices hear, and sometimes write drafts of 
their rulings. The protest is sponsored by the naacp.
