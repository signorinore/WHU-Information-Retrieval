Remaining oil from the 1989 Exxon valdez spill may be hurting alaskan 
salmon for generations. According to government researchers, the buried 
oil pockets are able to release poisons into the water. They say the 
pollutants can lead to stunted growth and other chronic problems for 
the fish. The Exxon supertanker spilled 10 million gallons of oil 
into prince William sound. Scientists hired by Exxon say the government 
research is flawed.
