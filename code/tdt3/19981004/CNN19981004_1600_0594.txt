Proposed changes in organ transplant regulations are meeting with 
mixed response. They would require patients to meet a different set 
of criteria. Louise Schiavone explains. Around 60,000 people in the 
United States are waiting for a new heart, liver, kidney or other 
organ. 53-year-old guy hodge of Philadelphia is one of them. Well, 
I'm waiting for a liver. And I've been waiting ostensibly since last 
August when the doctors told me I had only three months to a year 
to live if I did not get a new organ. He keeps vigil for a new organ 
at a Virginia hospital specializing in transplants. If a new liver 
becomes available and it's compatible, he's next. He worries a lot. 
Is it going to come in time? Time's getting short. I don't feel well 
today. Proposed new federal changes in the system could make hodge 
wait even longer. The idea, from health and human services secretary 
Donna Shalala, is to even the geographic distribution of all-too-rare 
donor organs. Under the new system, someone even sicker than hodge, 
living somewhere else in the nation, could get first rights to the 
next liver that becomes available in his part of the country. Hodge's 
doctor thinks that's a bad idea. If you transplant only the sickest 
individuals, more of those patients require retransplantation because 
the liver doesn't always work right away. If you're sick, require 
blood-pressure support, require other life-support measures, sometimes 
the liver doesn't work at all. So then you do fewer total patients, 
not fewer total transplants. Defenders of the new proposal say the 
truly sick should not lose out to the less sick because of where they 
live. Transplantation was designed to save the patients who have the 
least time to live. And it was really for the -- it was a last hope. 
And we're not doing that. I mean, there are patients who are being 
transplanted when they could have had another therapy done. The single 
biggest challenge is the scarcity of donor organs. At least ten people 
in the nation die every day waiting for an organ transplant. Louise 
Schiavone, for CNN, Washington.
