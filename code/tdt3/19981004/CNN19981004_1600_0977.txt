Computers and the Internet are changing how we work, communicate and 
play. Now they may be changing how we eat. Danae Jones has more. Raiding 
this refrigerator will get you much more than cold pizza. The Internet 
fridge is just one of many high-tech inventions featured at the world 
PC expo in makuhari, Japan. This icebox for the 21st century comes 
equipped with a computer on the door. The manufacturer says a refrigerator 
is the perfect place for a computer because it's used so often. a 
refrigerator is turned on 24 hours a day, so it's an ideal setting 
for a server. Family members pass by refrigerators at least once a 
day. Usually, people tack on memos, such as neighborhood events and 
school schedules on the fridge with magnets. I want people to use 
the Internet instead of that. But the Internet fridge shouldn't be 
limited to just keeping track of your family's busy schedule. The 
developers recommend you make it the electronic heart of the home, 
with hookups to your security system, TV, phone and air conditioner. 
As you may have noticed, the fridge has no keyboard. But you can make 
a grocery list using the touchpad screen. And if you've run out of 
dinner ideas, talk into this microphone built into the refrigerator. 
The computer answers her request for a delicious recipe with a chicken 
terrine dish. The manufacturer hopes to have the refrigerator on the 
market next year. Danae Jones, "Headline News."
