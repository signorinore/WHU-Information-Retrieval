The latest highlights from the gridiron and the diamond, next in "Headline 
Sports." And later -- Chris kattan takes his search for love to the 
big screen. Flight 57, now boarding... hey, junior, we don't want

exactly. But, this company's fast. Oh, sure, sure. Can't we skip the 
rental counter like at hertz? Well, not exactly. : dah... hey, genius, 
I'm waterlogged. Doesn't your company have a canopy like hertz? Well, 
not exactly. Remember, there's hertz and there's "not exactly." Choose
