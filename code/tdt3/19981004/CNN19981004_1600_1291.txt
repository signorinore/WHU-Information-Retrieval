Baseball -- the only divisional series still to be decided continues 
in San Diego tonight. The padres can wrap up a date with Atlanta in 
the nlcs with a win. That's after a 2-1 win last night. The astros 
need a "W" to stay alive and force a fifth game in the dome. Houston 
sends big lefty Randy Johnson to the helm. The pads like their chances 
with sterling hitchcock. We think a lot about hitchcock and you know, 
again, this is the position we wanted to be in, and we know we have 
our work cut out going against Randy Johnson. There's no strategy 
to this. You know, I'll go out and do the best I can, and these guys 
will all go out there and do the best they can. I mean, I don't feel 
beaten. I feel like we still have an excellent chance to win this 
series, but I don't like being down 2-1, I'll tell you that.
