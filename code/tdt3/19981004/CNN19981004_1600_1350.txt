Golf now -- watch this approach shot from England's Lee Westwood on 
the tenth hole in the final round of the Belgium open. From 130 yards 
out, he hits his green, bites and falls -- amazing. Westwood would 
win this thing in a playoff with Frederick jacobson. And if Westwood 
wins the season-ending Volvo masters, he will dethrone Colin Montgomerie 
as Europe's top money-winner. Matt Yallof, "Headline Sports."
