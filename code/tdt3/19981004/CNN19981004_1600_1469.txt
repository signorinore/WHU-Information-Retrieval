Sumo wrestling champion akebono is enjoying a belated wedding celebration. 
He and his bride, Christine reiko kalina, held a lavish party at a 
Tokyo hotel yesterday, six months after their April wedding. They 
became the parents of a baby girl in may. The couple met after akebono 
moved to Japan from his native Hawaii. In 1993, he became the first 
non-Japanese to win the sumo championship.
