It might look like a prop from a cartoon, but it's a real weapon. 
The French defense ministry has developed a rifle that fires around 
corners. The weapon uses a miniature camera in its scope to transmit 
targets onto a tiny video screen attached to the soldier's helmet. 
The French hope the gun will become the weapon of the future, letting 
troops take cover while locking onto targets.
