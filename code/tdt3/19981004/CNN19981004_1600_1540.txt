Another spin-off from "Saturday night live" is in movie theaters. 
"A night at the Roxbury" stars Chris kattan and will Ferrell, as two 
guys looking for a party. Anna Hovind has a look at the actors behind 
the characters. What is love lady, don't hurt me don't hurt me no 
more Chris kattan and will Ferrell bring their losers of the night 
characters from "Saturday night live" to the big screen. In "A night 
at the Roxbury," the pair show off some new moves. I have this one. 
And then they got this one. And then they got that one. In the film, 
we find out the brothers have a life outside the clubs. Well, not 
much of one. The character has to be human, you really have to like 
that character, otherwise you're going to get sick of it in like, 
you know, two minutes, really. If it's going to be like the sketch, 
where you're just going around going like that, "hey, how's it going." 
You know, it's going to be like, "okay, three minutes are up, and 
I'm going to leave." So you really have to relate to these people. 
And I think that, you know, really comes across, you really -- they're 
lovable losers. Kattan and Ferrell created the characters after some 
late night research. We saw a guy at a bar, and he was, you know, 
alone with a beer. And he was looking around, scoping the place for 
some girls, you know, trying to get noticed, saying, "maybe I could 
choose a dance with her. Do you want to, you do? Oh, okay, don't worry." 
You know, he's looking for someone to do this, and everybody's rejecting 
him, and we thought that was funny. And we didn't laugh and point 
at him, but we did something worse, we stood next to him and we were 
mocking him right next to him and he never noticed. "A night at the 
Roxbury" is kattan's first film. While he enjoyed making it, he still 
enjoys being a cast member on "Saturday night live." There is nothing 
that's like the rush of "Saturday night live" because it's live, and 
it's like anything can happen, any moment. It's just, you know, there's 
nothing like that, that rush, it's pretty amazing. And you don't get 
that same feeling from film. "A night at the Roxbury" is now bopping 
in theaters. Anna Hovind, "Headline News."
