A former president's solution for ending the current White House crisis 
-- instead of impeachment, humiliation. Bill Clinton facing the entire 
Congress from the well of the house and accepting a harshly worded 
rebuke. From democrats, a positive reaction. I think former President 
Ford has made a suggestion that is constructive and worthy of consideration. 
From republicans, respectful rejection. President Ford is not someone 
to whom I would look for guidance on issues related to impeachment. 
A house committee begins deciding on a formal impeachment inquiry 
tomorrow. broadcasting company, inc.
