Good evening. The house Judiciary committee is about to decide whether 
to launch an impeachment inquiry against President Clinton. An the 
eve of that action comes a surprising session from a former president. 
Gerald Ford suggests that Clinton not be impeached but scolded. His 
idea has heated up debate on how the president should be dealt with. 
John Palmer is at the White House tonight. John? The White House still 
wants the committee to limit its inquiry to the Monica Lewinsky matter, 
but they know the republicans have the votes for a broader investigation. 
White House lawyers were at work today, dealing with a new proposal 
that would allow Mr. Clinton to short-circuit the impeachment process. 
Former President Gerald Ford, in an op-Ed article in today's "New 
York Times," proposed that rather than impeachment, the president 
be publicly rebuked in the well of the house, saying -- Ford goes 
on to say -- the former president said he was making the suggestion 
not to rescue Bill Clinton from impeachment but to rescue the country 
from further turmoil or uncertainty, just as he had done when he assumed 
the presidency from Richard Nixon and then pardoned him. My fellow 
Americans, our long national nightmare is over. Our constitution works. 
Our great republic is a government of laws and not of men. The chairman 
of the house Judiciary committee, who said today he hopes to wrap 
up the house inquiry by the end of the year, was cool to Ford's proposal. 
I think that's very unlikely. I think the president would not gladly 
suffer that humiliation. Others thought Ford's suggestion premature. 
We have a clear constitutional process on the way here. And I don't 
think that we can make a decision about whether or not punishment 
is justifiable, or what that punishment should be, until we have had 
a chance to see all the evidence. I don't think we are there right 
now. And we need to go through these other steps before we can get 
there. Former White House counsel lanny Davis reflected the White 
House view. I think the former president has made a suggestion that 
is constructive and worth consideration. White House aides say Mr. 
Clinton is not likely to agree to Ford's proposal. But they see this 
as a positive development, since it opens the door to something less 
extreme than impeachment. len? NBC's John Palmer at the White House, 
thank you.
