A reminder -- a complete text of the Starr report and President Clinton's 
grand jury testimony is available on our web site -- MSNBC.com. When 
"NBC nightly news" continues in a moment -- efforts to make peace 
in Israel, despite attempts to disrupt the process. And later, "in 
focus," what America's highest court will deal with this term. Hey, 
you want a green light to eat like never before? i do. Healthy choice 
has a whole menu of unbelievably delicious dishes. Incredible meals. 
New chicken stirfry with a crispy, fried egg roll. Big hearty handfuls 
stuffed end to end with gooey cheese. My favorite, shrimp and vegetables 
with bow-tie pasta... in a creamy basil garlic sauce, mm-hmm. All 
around five grams of fat. Five. There's no stoppin' me now. Healthy 
choice. your green light to eat what you like. Eating quaker oatmeal 
on a daily basis... can help lower cholesterol. Mine dropped 29 points. 
That's one under the speed limit here in Lafayette, Colorado. Just 
a reminder.
