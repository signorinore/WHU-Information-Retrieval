In the mideast today, Palestinians and Israelis held low-level peace 
talks in advance of Tuesday's visit by secretary of state Madeleine 
Albright. The Clinton administration is pressing both sides for a 
permanent peace agreement. But extremists on both sides want to block 
it. From Tel Aviv, NBC's Martin Fletcher tonight. Through the weekend, 
Israel is stopping all Palestinians from entering the country, a defensive 
measure by Israel. Islamic militants are threatening a major terror 
attack. These threats are extremely serious. Signs of progress in 
the peace talks in Washington have fired up extremists, Arab and Israeli, 
who want to kill the peace process at any price. The Islamic militant 
leader, sheikh Ahmed Yassin, has called on his men to bomb, shoot 
or kidnap Israeli soldiers or civilians. Arab extremists through the 
bomb. Israeli extremists through the ballot -- extreme right-wing 
supporters and government members say they'll bring down the government 
if prime minister Netanyahu gives up the 13% more land he's promised 
to the Palestinians. We will not sit idly by. The same commitment 
and determination that elected him to office will be put to use to 
topple his government. This is why -- four hand-grenade attacks in 
hebron this month. In each case, the Palestinian attacker escaped 
to the part of town controlled by Yasser Arafat. Jewish settlers warn 
of a bloodbath waiting to happen. That's why Netanyahu won't budge 
from his demand -- if there is not complete security for Israelis, 
he won't agree to give up more land to the Palestinians. Despite public 
optimism after privately, Israeli and Palestinian leaders say there 
was no real progress in Washington. They're still wide apart on security 
issues. And bear in mind, all the drama of the last year and a half 
has just been about implementing a minor stage of the peace process. 
The hard questions like the future of Jerusalem, the borders, even 
the existence of a Palestinian state, are yet to be addressed. Martin 
Fletcher, NBC news, Tel Aviv.
