To a clash of cultures in this country. Despite protests, a native 
American tribe is preparing to reclaim its heritage by hunting whales 
which had been on the endangered list. It's happening on Washington's 
Olympic peninsula, in neah bay. NBC's Mike Boettcher is there tonight. 
In front, the hunters. A scout boat from the makah Indian tribe surveying 
the area where they will eventually Hunt the grey whale. Behind them, 
another boat. Hunting the hunters, a vessel operated by sea Shepherd, 
an anti-whaling group, which has vowed to disrupt the Hunt. And not 
far behind, the U.S. coast guard, keeping an eye on this cat-and-mouse 
game, trying to keep it from getting out of hand. It doesn't matter 
if they're makah whalers, protesters or individuals intent on exercising 
their rights. We're here to make sure they are safe when they are 
out on the water. This high-seas posturing off Washington state's 
far northwest coast has continued for four days. The makahs were expected 
to begin their whale Hunt October 1st, but are waiting. We're on a 
stand by now. So, none of us are leaving town. Kind of like firefighters 
ready to go at a moment's notice. The anti-whaling forces vow to stay 
on, determined to block the Hunt, which is guaranteed to the makah 
by U.S. treaty and international agreement. They have a small flotilla 
of protest boats at their disposal and even a few members of the makah 
tribe supporting their protest. Can something so beautiful, intelligent 
and such a giant, is it right to kill it? Because I want to feel better 
about myself? The majority of the tribe says yes. Whalers for 2,000 
years, the makah stopped hunting whale 70 years ago, when European, 
American and Japanese commercial whalers almost drove the giant sea 
mammals into extinction. Now, the makah wants to Hunt again in an 
effort to revive their culture. The makah whalers, who have been practicing 
for weeks in the narrow, wobbly canoe they will use in the Hunt, insist 
they are ready to begin at any time, prepared to resume their place 
as whale hunters even as they themselves are hunted. Mike Boettcher, 
NBC news, neah bay, Washington.
