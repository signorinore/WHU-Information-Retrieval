In New York tonight, baseball star Darryl Strawberry is in stable 
condition, recovering from successful cancer surgery yesterday. Doctors 
are hoping his celebrity status will make him a role model for early 
detection. Here's NBC's Rick Davis. The New York Yankees got the word 
that Darryl Strawberry is alert and feeling strong during their workout 
today. But his bout with colon cancer seems to have delivered a message 
to some of the Yankees. I'm sure that with the awareness, people are 
going to seek it out and get tested and do that when they get their 
physicals. I'm sure. And the message may carry beyond the playing 
fields. Someone of his national presence will certainly awaken the 
American population that this is not only a disease of older individuals 
but certainly someone as healthy and young as Darryl. Initial reports 
are optimistic, but it may be a week before doctors at this New York 
hospital know if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and if Strawberry 
will need chemotherapy. But there are models for recovery. Eric Davis 
just had his best year in baseball. He had colon surgery in 1997. 
Brett Butler was back on the diamond four months after throat surgery 
for cancer. Can Strawberry come back? Typically, someone like this 
is going to recover very well from surgery. And Strawberry will be 
hearing hopes for his return when Yankee players visit him tonight. 
We are just going to show our support. It's like a family member. 
We are just going to go and see how he is doing. And for the rest 
of the season, the Yankees will be wearing Strawberry's number 39 
stitched to their caps. Rick Davis, NBC news, New York.
