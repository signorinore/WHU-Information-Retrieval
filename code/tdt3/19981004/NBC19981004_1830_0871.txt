ticket. It's not on cable. see it on directv. So what are you looking 
at? A ention shoppers: now get $200 worth of programming when you

on rye catches up with me. Heartburn big time. My passenger says "here, 
take a Zantac 75." I say, "what are you, a doctor?" And he says, "yeah." 
The medicine in Zantac 75 is the #1 doctor-prescribed acid reducer. 
It relieves even your toughest heartburn controlling acid for up to 
12 hours. A real gentleman, that doctor. Zantac 75. Another breakthrough... 
from the one hour labs of Lenscrafters. New featherwates plus lenses. 
They're lighter. they're thinner. They're more impact resistant. And 
now, they're twice as scratch resistant... compared to regular plastic 
lenses. Made in about an hour.
