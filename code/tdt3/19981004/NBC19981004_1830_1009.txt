In "focus" this evening -- the U.S. Supreme Court. It was established 
more than 200 years ago to be the last word when it comes to judicial 
matters. It is about to tackle a new round of cases where individual 
rights are at stake. A preview from NBC's Pete Williams. a legal battle 
from Chicago presents one of this term's most important issues -- 
how far America's cities can go in fighting the rise of youth gangs. 
Chicago's response -- a 1992 law giving cops on the beat the power 
to arrest people they thought were gang members, simply for the crime 
of loitering, staying in one spot for no apparent reason. Many residents 
pleaded for the tough new law, fearing that gang members were staking 
out Turf and trying to recruit new members. And police responded with 
big loitering busts like this one, arresting nearly 43,000 people 
over three years, until the city ordinance was declared unconstitutional. 
An Illinois court said it violated everyone's right to walk around 
freely. The court agreed with civil liberties groups, who argued that 
innocent people could be arrested for disobeying vague orders to move 
along. In the ordinance, it says they should move to another area. 
What other area? How far should the person move? A few feet? A half 
a mile? Out of the neighborhood? But many in Chicago neighborhoods 
where loitering lo arrests were common support the city's appeal to 
the U.S. Supreme Court. They say police didn't go after innocent young 
people, only gang members. The police know who they are. They're not 
going to go crack down on some good kid. And you can tell who they 
are. Good kids don't dress thug-like. Good kids don't Hang out on 
the corners, flashing street signals. Lawyers involved in the case 
say there's no other anti-loitering ordinance in the country as broad 
as the one Chicago had. But if the Supreme Court upholds it, many 
cities are ready to try something just as tough.
