One of the other major civil rights cases this term comes from the 
classroom of a Georgia school, where a fifth-grade girl said a boy 
in her class kept sexually harassing her, becoming so abusive she 
considered suicide. The girl's parents say the school refused to do 
anything to stop it, so they sued, but lost. A federal court ruled 
that students can sue schools over harassment from their teachers, 
but not from other students. But women's groups say schools must also 
be accountable for what students do to each other. If the school allows 
the hostile environment to persist and doesn't address it, the school 
is fostering a discriminatory environment for female students.
