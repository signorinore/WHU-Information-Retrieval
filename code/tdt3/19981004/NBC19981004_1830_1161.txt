Also this term, the court will decide who should set the rules for 
encouraging competition that could lower the cost of local telephone 
service, with billions of dollars at stake. Dozens of companies want 
to give consumers as much choice in choosing a local phone company 
as there is now in long distance. The court must also rule on whether 
the government can use statistical estimates to adjust the census 
that's used to figure seats each state gets in Congress. Without estimates, 
the census bureau says it would undercount racial and ethnic minority 
groups, depriving them of equal representation.
