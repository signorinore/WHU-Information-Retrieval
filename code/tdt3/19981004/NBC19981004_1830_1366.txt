To the embattled Yugoslav province of Kosovo now. NAto has threatened 
Serb forces with air strikes, because of their brutal tactics to squash 
a drive for independence. Tonight, it is clear the Serbs are working 
hard to avoid NATO intervention. But the question is for how long? 
NBC's Ron Allen is in Kosovo tonight. Troops withdrawn from Kosovo. 
Observers report some 200 military vehicles pulled back today. More 
proof, the Serbs insist, NAto has no reason to strike. Also today, 
Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, got more help from their 
most outspoken allies, the Russians, who have warned of dire consequences 
if NATO attacks. And now with envoy Richard Holbrooke, heading to 
Belgrade for talks. To many, it looks like Milosevic has escaped punishment 
once again. Milosevic now realizes that he has to lay low for while. 
We're on the brink of a NATO intervention. He doesn't want to see 
that. It's a familiar pattern. Milosevic avoids NATO air strikes by 
stopping his offensive long enough until the U.S. and its allies look 
away. Then, it's feared, he would resume the assault that so far has 
left more than 800 dead and 300,000 homeless. Analysts say Milosevic 
knows the U.S. and its allies don't want to get too involved in this 
conflict. The western states and the United States have been breathing 
fire and brimstone for the last six months, threatening him with final 
warnings, and nothing comes of it. But each round of cat-and-mouse 
causes countless people to suffer, more homes where some refugees 
want to return, burned to the ground. Most of these people, too afraid 
to stay overnight. At this point, a NAto decision whether to launch 
air strikes could still be several days away. Most people here think 
that would be too late -- the damage has already been done. Ron Allen, 
NBC news, Kosovo.
