When "NBC nightly news" continues in a moment -- how hip-hop is invading 
Japan. Another breakthrough... from the one hour labs of Lenscrafters. 
New featherwates plus lenses. They're lighter. they're thinner. They're 
more impact resistant. And now, they're twice as scratch resistant... 
compared to regular plastic lenses. Made in about an hour. I've just 
got this burning love for food. But sometimes it just doesn't love 
me back. Heartburn surging up to here. What my doctor calls acid reflux. 
When I get it, he says get gaviscon. Only regular gaviscon forms a 
soothing, protective barrier to help keep stomach acid down -- where 
it belongs. Mylanta can't -- pepcid ac can't. Only gaviscon can. So 
my heartburn doesn't come back to burn me. It helps keep acid down 
where it be longs.
