Finally tonight, America's latest cultural export. It's a street-smart 
combination of music, fashion and lots of attitude. And it's helping 
young people make a very public statement in a society very sensitive 
to tradition. Here's NBC's kiko Itasaka. Straight from urban America 
to the streets of Japan, most definitely unjapanese. But for many, 
hip hop is the happening thing. This D.J. says it's more than a fad. 
It's grounded. And I thought it was going to fade away. But it gets 
stronger and stronger. Music is just part of it. Japanese teens are 
dressing and, yes, even looking the part. It requires a substantial 
investment of time and money. Nine hours, $900. Some last minute touchups. 
Then it's off to Tokyo's hip-hop club scene. You might ask why this 
music and dance born in America is so popular. Hardly anyone speaks 
English and they can't follow the words. But they say it doesn't matter 
because they still get the message. American dancer Thomas Paul says 
the rebellious attitude of hip-hop speaks to young Japanese and helps 
them to break away from their conformist heritage. Everything says 
do what we tell you. They're saying, we're tired of this. With it 
as it is right now, the Japanese youth are looking for their role. 
For this girl it is an escape. I listen to the music and I feel good 
when I'm dancing. This is not the first time American culture has 
been embraced by Japan. But right now, hip-hop is a hot seller, enjoyed 
by people of various ages. Kiko Itasaka, NBC news, Tokyo.
