That's "NBC nightly news" for this Sunday. Here's Jane pauley with 
a look at what's coming up tonight on "dateline nbc." Thanks, Len. 
Tonight on "Dateline," a child in desperate conditions, stolen from 
the hospital that could save his life. And the two suspects are his 
parents. I just knew with every part of me that they were going to 
try to take this child. If they did? He would die. I don't know how 
long it will take. How could this have happened and can they find 
the child in time? Tonight on "Dateline." Thanks Jane. Tom Brokaw 
will be here tomorrow. I'm Len Cannon. Have a good night and a good 
week ahead. The Sunday edition of "dateline NBC" is next.
