Art and entertainment can satirize any forbidden subject if the treatment 
is witty and thoughtful enough; that's what satire is. But let's not 
confuse ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer'' with art, entertainment 
or satire. This is a jaw-droppingly witless series about an aristocratic 
black Englishman who flees from his gambling debts and finds work 
at the White House as Abe Lincoln's butler. Meant to be a parody of 
the Clinton White House, the series has stumbled into notoriety for 
another reason. The pilot episode drew protests from black groups 
charging that it treated slavery as a joke. As a result the UPN network 
has substituted a different episode for Monday night's premiere. Now 
Lincoln has telegraph sex with an unknown woman. Now Desmond tells 
the president, ``If I may be so bold, sir, you're acting no better 
than a horny hillbilly from Arkansas.'' Is ``Desmond Pfeiffer'' insensitive? 
Of course it is, though not because it dares to take race or presidential 
sex as its subjects. It is offensive because it treats them in such 
a clumsy, name-calling way. ``Desmond Pfeiffer'' is likely to drive 
away blacks, whites, presidents, historians and especially people 
with a sense of humor. Does it treat slavery as a joke? Glancingly 
in the scuttled pilot. The approach is not malicious, but its careless 
attitude seems only marginally better than outright bigotry. That 
original episode (which UPN says it is reviewing and may reschedule) 
explains the current flap better than Monday night's. ``The slaves 
haven't been emancipated yet; get your feet off the table,'' an officious 
White House staffer tells Desmond. The joke is that Desmond is superior 
to this buffoon in every way. Desmond, who has never been a slave, 
is by far the smartest man in the White House. The true idiots are 
white, including Desmond's personal lackey, Nibblet, whom he describes 
as ``my trusted manservant and part-time footrest.'' Nibblet literally 
cannot tell his right from his left and repeatedly puts his hand on 
a hot stove. In what may be the only flash of genuine satire in the 
original pilot, Desmond briefly tries to assume a slavish attitude 
and language as a ruse. The words ``I just love my massa so'' come 
out with his typical well-bred English accent and supercilious air. 
But ``Desmond Pfeiffer'' cannot be defended as a satire attacking 
slavery; that would require a level of sophistication this muddled 
series never approaches. Instead, both episodes rely on jokes so cheap 
and hoary they seem positively vaudevillian. Nibblet's feet smell 
like cheese! The series is fond of weak double-entendres. And a mean-spirited 
running gag involves the sexually frustrated, plump Mary Lincoln, 
frequently seen in her bubble bath, raising her arms to reveal major 
underarm hair growth. The contemporary parallels are ham-fisted. In 
Monday's episode, when Desmond discovers the president telegraphing 
lewd messages, he says, ``You don't have to explain, sir, this isn't 
a grand jury.'' Lincoln later wonders: ``Can you imagine what would 
happen if the president were found in a compromising position? What 
would I do, apologize to the whole nation?'' Television viewers are 
always hoping for something different. ``Desmond Pfeiffer'' (pronounced 
Puh-feiffer in another inane attempt at comedy) gives new meaning 
to the warning ``Be careful what you ask for.'' In fact, the UPN schedule 
is loaded with oddball new series. ``Mercy Point'' Tuesday at 9) means 
to be ``ER'' meets ``Star Trek,'' but this drama about a hospital 
in space is not even entertaining in a goofy, campy way. ``Legacy'' 
(Friday at 8) is a post-Civil War soap opera about the lives and lusts 
of an Irish horse-breeding family in Kentucky. At least it has lavish 
photography. The horses look sleek, the grass looks emerald and the 
people all look like models, though no one has anything interesting 
to say. Like ``Desmond Pfeiffer,'' these other UPN series smack of 
a frantic bid for attention. They merely highlight the difference 
between desperation and true invention.
