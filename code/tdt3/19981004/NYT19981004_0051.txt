Bristling with suspicion, I picked up Robert Brawer's ``Fictions of 
Business: Insights on Management From Great Literature.'' First, the 
very juxtaposition of the human imagination and business management 
seemed somehow contradictory. The dust jacket of Brawer's book, a 
detail of Edward Hopper's painting ``Office at Night,'' said it all: 
the possibility of any spontaneous interchange between the young woman 
at the file cabinet and the young man at the desk seems deadened by 
something unseen, perhaps the threat of bankruptcy looming in the 
next room. Second, a quick glance at the table of contents reveals 
that among Brawer's examples is David Mamet's play about the salesman-eat-salesman 
Florida real-estate business, ``Glengarry Glen Ross.'' You think: 
if this is a sample of how a business ought to be run, I don't want 
to know about it. But Brawer immediately surprises you and gradually 
begins to win you over to his views. His point about Richard Roma, 
the supersalesman played by Joe Montegna in the stage version of ``Glengarry 
Glen Ross'' (and by Al Pacino in the film), is that he seems to violate 
every real-life canon of good salesmanship, like not talking too much, 
or seeking to understand the customer's needs. But in fact Roma reminds 
Brawer of some of the best salesmen he has ever known, who were masters 
at creating a sense of theater and understood that what they were 
selling was essentially themselves. Brawer keeps doing the unexpected 
throughout ``Fictions of Business.'' This parallels his career, which 
began with his teaching English literature at the University of Wisconsin, 
where he specialized in medieval studies, then led to his joining 
Maidenform Inc., the women's apparel maker, where he worked for 20 
years in marketing positions, including chief executive and president 
of Maidenform Worldwide. He now teaches a cross-disciplinary course, 
``Fictions of Business,'' at New York University. In his introduction, 
he writes that over the course of his career as a business executive, 
people who knew about his academic background were always asking him 
how he felt about being in the ``real'' world. His response was that 
he wasn't at all certain he was any more in the ``real'' world now 
than he had been before, since marketing always depended on ``capturing 
the minds of consumers'' by creating a certain perception. In that 
spirit, Brawer introduces several other fictional salesmen, among 
them Chaucer's merchant, who, the author points out, is such a self-made 
master of appearances that the narrator of ``The Canterbury Tales'' 
cites him as ``a worthy man with-alle,'' even though ``sooth to seyn,'' 
he doesn't even know his name. And Anthony Trollope's Melmotte, the 
wealthy financier in ``The Way We Live Now,'' whose fraudulent creation 
of the South Central Pacific and Mexican Railway Brawer compares to 
Robert Campeau's leveraged buyout and near destruction of Allied Stores. 
To Brawer the timelessness of such fictional creations belies ``the 
notion that the information revolution, so-called, will make traditional 
ways of selling and buying obsolete (or reduce our vulnerability to 
con men).'' We may get more facts about products from the Internet, 
he says. But we still require a sense of illusion when we buy them. 
In the most telling parts of his book, Brawer addresses the apparent 
contradiction between business and the human imagination. The notion 
that people lose their individuality in choosing a corporate career 
``is baseless,'' Brawer insists, and some of the most memorable novels 
and plays about business underline his point. The title of Sloan Wilson's 
1956 novel, ``The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit,'' may well have come 
to describe the businessman as automaton. But the novel's plot actually 
concerns a man who redeems his career by becoming more self-aware, 
Brawer points out. And in Arthur Miller's ``Death of a Salesman,'' 
it is not the business environment that destroys Willy Loman but rather 
his inability to give up his own self-destructive illusions. In Brawer's 
experience, business leaders who misunderstood the play and vowed 
to be kinder to their older employees tended to harm their companies 
by keeping the wrong people on too long. Similar provocative lessons 
are drawn from such works as ``Point of No Return,'' by John P. Marquand; 
``Major Barbara,'' by George Bernard Shaw; ``The Financier,'' by Theodore 
Dreiser; ``Babbitt,'' by Sinclair Lewis; ``The Big Money,'' by John 
Dos Passos; ``The Jungle,'' by Upton Sinclair; ``A Connecticut Yankee 
in King Arthur's Court,'' by Mark Twain; ``Office Politics,'' by Wilfrid 
Sheed; ``The Catbird Seat,'' by James Thurber; and ``Typhoon,'' by 
Joseph Conrad. Throughout his book, Brawer moves nimbly between smart 
interpretation of these texts and pointed real-life illustrations 
of their contents. More and more as you read him, you wonder why in 
the popular American imagination the image of businessmen has fallen 
so far from the time in the mid-19th century when, as Brawer points 
out, ``merchants thought of themselves and were generally regarded 
as men of intellect and culture.'' Why has the eponymous hero of Sinclair 
Lewis' ``Babbitt,'' which, Brawer argues, was intended merely to satirize 
the excesses of efficiency, come to stand for businessmen in general? 
Perhaps this is the subject for another book by Brawer. In the meantime, 
with ``Fictions of Business,'' he has dug beneath ``the fashionable 
buzzwords and managerial ideologies of the day'' that he so deplores, 
and made us see some universal truths common to both business and 
fiction. PUBLICATION NOTES: Insights on Management From Great Literature
