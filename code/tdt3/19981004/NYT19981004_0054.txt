For a while in the 1940s, movie fans could count not only on a double 
feature, a newsreel and a cartoon at their local movie house, but 
also on a plea from a star for a contribution to fight polio. The 
clink of coins in cans was the music for what must be the most successful 
publicity campaign in a worthy cause ever to capture America. ``The 
March of Dimes,'' as it was famously known, is celebrated Monday night 
in ``A Paralyzing Fear: The Story of Polio in America.'' Pictures 
from the archives recall a period when outbreaks of the mysterious 
ailment known as infantile paralysis were crippling and killing children, 
yet the federal government had not yet ventured seriously into fighting 
the disease. This history, like the companion book by Nina Gilden 
Seavey, Jane Smith and Paul Wagner, gives a survivors' eye view of 
the illness: pain, isolation and paralysis; braces, crutches and iron 
lungs; little hope of cure and fear of death. Among the survivors, 
most memorably, was Franklin D. Roosevelt, who served as president 
without the use of his legs and inspired what would become a national 
drive to prevent polio. The humane hucksterism of the time, presided 
over by Basil O'Connor, the March of Dimes impresario, made powerful 
use of celebrity appeals, ``birthday balls,'' ``mothers' marches,'' 
``the poster child'' and other means of raising money for the research 
that would bring success. A short course in the nature of polio and 
the urgent efforts to develop a vaccine against it are provided, but 
the focus is on a few men and women whose lives were forever changed 
by the disease. In the 1950s, as the incidence of polio was on the 
rise (59,000 new cases in 1952), hopes were invested in the ``killed 
virus'' approach developed by Jonas Salk and the ``live virus'' approach 
of Albert Sabin, a competition that has been treated in sharper detail 
elsewhere: the Salk injections won the initial race, reducing polio 
cases markedly; then, by the 1960s, they were replaced by the easier 
to administer Sabin oral vaccine, which was endorsed by the American 
Medical Association in 1961. The happy ending was the eradication 
of polio in North America, although epidemics continue in some parts 
of the world. As for the early sufferers from whom we hear extensively 
on Monday, the reaction is more melancholy. ``For me it was too little 
too late,'' one says. ``But I was so grateful no one else would have 
to go through this.'' PRODUCTION NOTES: The Story of Polio in America
