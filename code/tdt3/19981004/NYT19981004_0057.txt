The American Association of Advertising Agencies, in a significant 
step, is opening membership for the first time to independently owned 
agencies that specialize in services outside the realm of traditional 
advertising, like media planning and buying, public relations and 
corporate identity consulting. The change, to be announced formally 
Monday and take immediate effect, is indicative of marketers' increasing 
communication with consumers in ways different from such conventional 
methods as television commercials and print advertisements. It is 
also emblematic of the remaking of the agency industry as mergers 
and acquisitions reduce the ranks of membership in the association, 
known as the Four A's, from a peak of 764 in 1988 to 540 today. Indeed, 
as if to underline that trend, Avrett, Free &AMP; Ginsberg in New 
York _a midsized independent shop that has long been a member of the 
association _ unexpectedly agreed on Friday to be acquired by a Madison 
Avenue giant. Avrett, Free, which handles accounts with billings estimated 
at $370 million, is being bought for undisclosed terms by the Bozell 
Worldwide unit of True North Communications in New York. ``There has 
been a lot of consolidation in our membership base over the last decade,'' 
said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the Four A's 
in New York. ``The bottom line is that the advertising agency business 
is changing,'' he added, ``and the association founded to serve the 
industry must reflect this reality and evolve.'' The Four A's ``will 
not change our primary focus,'' Drake said, because ``advertising 
is what the association is about.'' ``But the age of just doing 30-second 
commercials for most clients is long gone,'' he said. The association 
now has members that do not create traditional forms of advertising, 
but only because they are owned by agencies that do. For instance, 
Western International Media is a Four A's member because it is part 
of Interpublic Group of Cos., but an independent competitor, DeWitt 
Media Inc., has not been eligible to join. ``We're obviously pleased'' 
by the change, said Bob Flood, senior vice president and director 
for national broadcast at DeWitt in New York. ``This acknowledges 
the value of media in the advertising process.'' DeWitt ``will consider 
joining'' the association, he added, because ``we always felt we were 
part of the advertising community.'' A top executive at an independent 
public relations agency described the loosening of the membership 
rules as ``long overdue.'' ``It shows the acceptance of public relations 
as a key part of integrated marketing,'' said Renee Edelman, executive 
vice president at PR 21 in New York, owned by Daniel Edelman Inc., 
which also owns Edelman Public Relations Worldwide, the largest freestanding 
public relations agency. Ms. Edelman said that she would ``definitely'' 
join the Four A's as a result of the revamping of the membership provisions. 
According to Drake, the change would not increase revenue for the 
association because ``dues are based on a percentage of members' revenues'' 
rather than the number of members. ``So if one agency buys another,'' 
Drake said, ``the revenues are combined and the acquirer pays on the 
combined amount.'' Revenue at the Four A's has increased to $13 million 
for 1998-99, he added, from about $8.5 million in the corresponding 
period a decade ago. True North will be paying more in dues as a result 
of the deal to acquire Avrett, Free, which lists among its clients 
the Clairol Professional unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.; Crayola, 
owned by Hallmark Cards; Enterprise Rent-a-Car, and Ralston Purina 
Co. Avrett, Free, founded in 1970, will retain its name and operate 
as an autonomous unit of Bozell, which also works for Bristol-Myers 
Squibb. ``There will always be small, medium and large agencies and 
you can stay small or medium,'' said Frank Ginsberg, 51, who will 
continue as president, chief executive and creative director at Avrett, 
Free. ``But to keep up with the needs of clients as they grow, you've 
got to be part of a global network _ now more so than ever.'' Asked 
if he was sad that Avrett, Free was no longer free, Ginsberg replied: 
``Those people who feel independence is a strength are great, and 
God bless them. But for public relations, direct marketing, Internet 
marketing and expansion in North America and worldwide, we needed 
to align ourselves with the right company with the right resources 
and the right people.'' Ginsberg was attracted to True North because 
he has long been friendly with top executives of Bozell and Foote, 
Cone &AMP; Belding, the other principal worldwide agency owned by 
True North. ``It's a natural progression of relationships,'' said 
David Bell, president and chief executive at Bozell. ``Frank needed 
additional resources and the opportunity to serve clients outside 
the United States, and we were comfortable with him, his clients and 
the way he does business.'' The acquisition is the largest made by 
Bozell since the agency was acquired by True North late last year. 
Bozell's billings are estimated at $3.1 billion and True North's at 
$10.8 billion. Among other independent agencies acquired this year 
are: Arnold Communications in Boston, now part of Snyder Communications; 
Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, taken over by Interpublic, 
and Hal Riney &AMP; Partners, purchased by Publicis SA.
