An intensifying storm in the central Plains will produce a variety 
of inclement conditions in the middle of the nation on Monday. Gusty 
thunderstorms will erupt across the Mississippi Valley as an approaching 
cold front intercepts a very warm and humid air mass moving north 
from the Gulf States. Severe thunderstorms with large hail and perhaps 
a few tornadoes are possible from northeast Texas to central Iowa. 
Cold rain with embedded thunderstorms are likely from northern Minnesota 
across most of the Dakotas and into eastern Montana. Strong winds 
from the north in Wyoming will force the chilly, moist air into the 
mountains. As the damp air ascends the sloping terrain, heavy snow 
is likely in the Big Horn mountains. The combination of brisk winds 
to 35 miles an hour along with the rain will pose a hazard to livestock 
in the northwest Plains. Much cooler air will sweep southeastward 
across the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles while it becomes mainly sunny 
and cooler in the southwest Plains. Farther east, clouds and scattered 
showers will affect the Tennessee and Ohio valleys as well as the 
western Great Lakes. The Northeast will turn cooler as a formidable 
high pressure system builds southward from James Bay, Canada. Farther 
south, clouds will recede from the Middle Atlantic states as drier 
air circulates in from the north. The Southeast will stay dull and 
humid. Meanwhile, the California coast will be very warm with plenty 
of sunshine and gusty winds from the east. The Northwest will notice 
some clouds, but the afternoon will be milder. Focus: High and Dry 
Ohio September was warm and very dry in Ohio. In Mansfield, only .70 
inches of rain was measured making it the driest September on record. 
Akron noted .61 inches for its third-driest September. Many sections 
also ranked in the top ten warmest Septembers with readings more than 
three degrees above average. The combination of warmth and dryness 
can be attributed to a stronger than usual jet stream across the northern 
states. These fast winds aloft prevented moisture from the South from 
advancing into the region while regularly drawing warm air eastward 
from the Plains.
