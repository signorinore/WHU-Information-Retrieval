Of all the unknowns about the Internet, the greatest questions may 
revolve around whether or not it will ever become a reliable money 
maker. Granted, some companies do earn money through World Wide Web 
sites, but for the majority the promise of e-commerce with vast new 
markets, customers and profits remains unfulfilled. That does not 
daunt those who believe that with customized information delivery 
and targeted advertising, someday the Internet will become the most 
lucrative way to sell goods and services. They picture a world in 
which customers will leave traces of information about their habits, 
preferences, spending patterns, economic needs and personal status 
every time they use a computer. The information will be sorted into 
databases and used to fashion Web sites, promotional campaigns, advertisements 
and even junk mail that is tailored specifically to each user. Certainly 
such visions raise concerns about privacy. Without tackling those 
issues, however, many companies are at work on the software and hardware 
needed to make culling the information and setting up the databases 
a reality. One company, Thinking Media Corp. of New York, has a new 
patent for a method of tracking how people respond to Internet advertisements 
and commercial Web sites. The company says that its approach is singular 
because rather than count the number of ads or Web-site pages sent 
out by Internet server computers, it counts the sites or ads actually 
received by the browser software on individual computers. Many Web 
sites earn money by selling advertising space. They carry banner ads 
in the manner of city buses adorned with placards for jeans, new movies 
and fast-food restaurants. Surely people see those ads as the bus 
passes, but do they pay attention to them? Do they buy the jeans? 
By the same token, advertisers wonder whether an ad on a Web site 
catches anyone's eye. How many people actually follow it up? There 
are a variety of ways for advertisers to track how many ``hits,'' 
or clicks of a mouse, a particular ad icon or Web site receives. Data 
can be collected from central servers, or from the individual sites 
that display the ads. But Owen Davis, the managing director and a 
founder of Thinking Media, says the vagaries of how Internet servers 
provide access to computer users mean those methods undercount how 
many ads actually reach people as they sit at their terminals. That's 
because the Internet was created as a series of independent computer 
networks that would not be subject to total failure if one or more 
sections went down. But that makes it difficult to track the movement 
of information between browsers and servers that act independently 
and do not communicate. ``What we've done is insert a very small homing 
beacon that goes along with an ad or a Web page,'' Davis explained. 
``It's a piece of Java, a Java applet.'' Vid Jain, the company's chief 
creative officer, explained, ``The patent covers the idea of embedding 
a little smart piece of software with something sent out, whether 
it's a Web page, an ad or other resource, so when it gets to your 
machine it gets `live,' and sends back information.'' Part of that 
information, Davis said, is ``how much time the client spent on the 
Web site; once the Web site is loaded, it starts a timer and it runs.'' 
Thus, when someone uses a browser to call up a Web site, the software 
enables Davis' company to follow that page as it leaves the server 
and heads for its destination. The patent also eliminates a problem 
created by the process known as caching. That refers to the time-saving 
mechanism under which a person loads a page from a server one time. 
After that, the page is stored on his or her PC hard drive, creating 
a temporary backlog of recent documents. This cache means the server 
does not continually have to send items the user has recently requested. 
``In terms of keeping track and counting on the server side, if you 
look at a page twice or more but the server has only sent it once, 
then there's no way to keep track,'' Davis pointed out. With his company's 
software, ``every time the page comes up and a person looks at it, 
it sends back a message that it's live, that the page is live.'' Thinking 
Media's software uses so-called cookie files that identify individual 
computers and Internet protocols, or Web site addresses, ``as a way 
to mark someone,'' Davis said. ``We don't know the person, but we 
know their machine,'' he added. ``We can look at the time they spend, 
the cached ads, we can look at the cookie and the IP, and we can collect 
environmental variables like the browser type and the kind of operating 
system they're on. ``The value of the cookie and IP identifiers as 
we build a profile is that we can know that someone has seen an ad 
twice, so we can take them off the list and swap the ad for another 
one,'' Davis explained. ``Now we have real control over the reach 
and frequency, and over ads and Web pages.'' The patented software 
tracks how people use commercial Web sites as well. ``As someone moves 
through an ad and makes use of different `decision trees,' it allows 
us to keep track of that as well,'' he said. ``Say Barnes &AMP; Noble 
has live chats with famous authors online. As part of their promotional 
feature, they put up six book covers. You click on one, see a page 
of the book, and say `enroll me in that,' and 24 hours before the 
event Barnes &AMP; Noble sends an e-mail that says `Don't forget.' 
``But it's also interesting to Barnes &AMP; Noble to know that you 
looked at three other books but didn't enroll in the chats,'' he continued. 
``Imagine that you are Coca-Cola and you put a game inside an ad. 
There's nothing to sign up for, but somebody might play the game for 
three minutes. That's incredibly important information because they 
had your undivided attention for three minutes and they need to know 
that.'' He added, ``Where an ad has some depth and requires people 
to move through it, we can capture the time spent'' as well as other 
statistics about use. Thinking Media's software is already in use 
at companies like the Conde Nast unit of Advance Publications, American 
Express, Procter &AMP; Gamble and IBM, Davis said. He and Jain received 
patent 5,769,952. Patents are available by number for $3 from the 
Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.
