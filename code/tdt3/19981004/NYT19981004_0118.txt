When Jeff Stewart started Square Earth, a company based in New York 
that develops World Wide Web applications for Fortune 500 companies, 
he knew that managing cash flow would be almost as important as getting 
business. As a former consultant with Ernst &AMP; Young's financial 
services division, he knew how large companies operated, and realized 
that collections, and thus cash flow, would be a problem. ``The bigger 
the company, the longer it takes to get paid,'' he said. Painfully 
late payments _ the dirty little secret of running a small technology-based 
company, especially one catering to Fortune 1000 companies _ are a 
major problem for many of New York's ``Silicon Alley'' companies. 
While most vendors expect small businesses to pay outstanding bills 
within 30 days _ not one day later _ small companies often find themselves 
struggling to get paid by companies with vast accounting departments 
where no one seems accountable. Square Earth was acquired in January 
by Proxicom, based in Reston, Va., and Stewart now serves as marketing 
director for Proxicom's financial services practice. Making payroll 
is no longer his responsibility, but from day one as chief financial 
officer of Square Earth, he had a systematic, methodical, nearly obsessive 
strategy for collecting his receivables, which ranged from $50,000 
to $300,000 per invoice. ``We would structure the deal to allow us 
to invoice as quickly as possible,'' he recalled. ``We would cut invoices 
on time. The invoice would be constantly monitored. We would follow 
up three days after we sent the invoice out to make sure it was received. 
On day 15, we would follow up again, and on day 28, we'd make sure 
it was being processed.'' Stewart concedes that this vigilance did 
not always expedite an invoice, but it did let him know where things 
stood. ``Our invoices were payable on demand,'' he said. ``So if the 
company normally paid in 200 days, well, then we'd get paid on day 
200. I don't think they noticed what our terms were.'' As the company 
grew, Stewart secured a credit line from Silicon Valley Bank East 
that he described as ``critical to our growth.'' ``It wasn't such 
a big risk for Silicon Valley Bank,'' he said, ``because all of our 
customers were Fortune 500 companies, so the bank knew it was going 
to get paid.'' Credit lines, however, are hard to come by. For instance, 
Silicon Valley Bank East generally only grants them to technology 
companies that already have venture backing or some other investor 
support. ``Square Earth was already generating decent revenues,'' 
said Doug Marshall, the bank's vice president. ``They were at a break-even 
point and had an angel investment,'' referring to financial backers 
who provided seed money. Ben Boissevain, managing director of E-Technologies 
Associates, a firm that helps technology companies raise money, says 
that while it is not impossible to get a credit line, the opportunity 
costs are high. ``Sometimes it's just easier to get venture funding,'' 
he said. For clients who pursue a credit line, Boissevain suggests 
opening personal and business accounts at the bank, getting to know 
the loan officer by name, talking to him or her about the business, 
and then eventually asking for a small credit line. ``It's a step-up 
process,'' he said. ``The banker needs to trust you as an individual.'' 
Marc Suzdak, formerly general manager and co-founder of a New York-based 
Web design company, Oculus Interactive, applied the personal approach 
to his collection process. When IBM became an Oculus client, Suzdak 
found out who could push the button to get a check cut and then made 
it a point to develop that relationship. ``It's a client relationship 
people generally overlook completely,'' he said. ``Late payment can 
be the death of a small business.'' Through a series of phone calls 
and a strategy of respect and courtesy, Suzdak got to know the button 
pusher as a friend, and vice versa. IBM owed Oculus anywhere from 
$25,000 to $50,000 at any given time, and ``our checks came in on 
time, sometimes overnight,'' he said. ``Just like in anything else, 
people take care of people who they like.'' Oculus was sold last June 
to Blair Lake New Media, and Suzdak is now with a Web development 
software firm, Arcus. He never met his phone friend at IBM. Stephen 
King's company, Virtual Growth Inc., has served as a bookkeeping and 
accounting service for 150 Silicon Alley companies. In addition to 
standard accounting services, the firm handles billings and collections. 
King often finds himself doling out advice to managers in positions 
similar to those of Stewart and Suzdak. ``We recommend to our clients 
that they clearly understand the chain of command when dealing with 
larger companies,'' he said. ``Where does the invoice have to go before 
it gets paid? What's the process? They need to find out the time-frame 
for payment. What is the minimum amount? If it's going to take too 
long, we advise them to bill a month in advance and to build that 
into the contract.'' Collections are difficult for any size business. 
Invoices are lost. Someone is waiting on an approval of an approval. 
The guy who signs the checks is on vacation. Sometimes, the customer 
simply knows he can draw the vendor out because the vendor needs the 
business and is not going to jeopardize the account. Large corporations 
can manage all these problems with entire departments dedicated to 
collections and bankers at their heels. But what small companies have 
are overdue notices from their insurance companies, employees waving 
deposit slips on the 15th and 30th, and late-payment fees adding up 
on their personal credit cards. So the entrepreneur must find creative 
ways to circumvent the issue, learning how to manage not only his 
company's cash flow but those of its clients. Now safely ensconced 
in an established company and with a direct-deposited salary, Stewart 
has the luxury of reflecting on the early days. ``When you're eight 
to 10 employees, you can max your credit card out to make payroll,'' 
he said. ``But once your payroll exceeds your life savings, you know 
things are getting serious. That's when you think about paying the 
bills constantly. It's on your mind when you go to sleep at night 
or when you're brushing your teeth.''
