Ah, debauchery. It really doesn't make for a sustainable life style, 
but those who gave themselves over to it sure came up with some fine 
rock 'n' roll. Rod Stewart, who swooped down upon Madison Square Garden 
on Friday and Saturday, was once the grand master of amiable abandon. 
Now he's 53 and settled down with a supermodel and a career marketing 
schmaltzy ballads and his own oldies. He has preserved himself in 
the aspic of his good nature, and his continued stamina is a marvel. 
He still likes to think about the bad times, though. His concert on 
Friday night opened with ``Cigarettes and Alcohol,'' a song by Oasis 
that he covers on his latest album, ``When We Were the New Boys'' 
(Warner Brothers). That barroom stomper sounds like the ones he recorded 
with the Faces in the early 1970s; by recording it and ``Rocks,'' 
by Primal Scream, he neatly reclaimed a style younger bands had filched. 
Yet this silk-clad showman knows better than to bring back real rock-and-roll 
excess, not so much because it would make a man of his age look foolish 
_ Stewart has never feared foolishness _ but because such displays 
have lost their cachet. The Gallagher brothers of Oasis seem disgusting 
when they overdo things. It is cooler to keep your nasty habits to 
yourself, or to render them theatrical, the way Marilyn Manson or 
the reformed Courtney Love does. The latter method is what Stewart 
opted for on Friday. It would have been fun if he had let himself 
go just once, but his two-hour show was the epitome of calculated 
fun. His band and set list could have been determined by the principles 
of feng shui, the Chinese philosophy of balancing elements. A virile, 
tattooed guitarist here, a Boyz II Men type on backing vocals there, 
a glam-rock dude on keyboards and a drummer as precise as a cyborg: 
Stewart's accompaniment provided him with every useful pop trope. 
The music this collection of archetypes produced stayed balanced and 
within bounds, the Broadway version of the singer's ouevre. Stewart 
performed his array of raunchy sex odes and anthemic tearjerkers as 
if he were going for a Tony. His costume changes culminated with a 
yellow jacket that matched his Day-Glo socks. On both knees for a 
melodramatic ``Tonight's the Night,'' wagging his tail during ``Hot 
Legs,'' sprawled out and grinning at the end of ``Twistin' the Night 
Away,'' he humorously choreographed his enthusiasm. To demonstrate 
how he had kept in such good shape, he kicked soccer balls into the 
audience throughout the set. As for the voice that occasioned all 
this madness, it remains a distinctively accessible instrument. The 
tenor famous for being part rooster crow and part lover's croon tips 
toward screechiness now, but Stewart managed a lovely falsetto on 
``Have I Told You Lately?'' and belted with gusto on the night's rockers. 
However much he overindulged, he always cared for his vocal cords. 
Such prudence is just what you'd expect from a man who so skillfully 
turns excess into a routine.
