Fear is not the best motivation for musical composition, but all three 
pieces on the St. Petersburg Philharmonic's program at Carnegie Hall 
on Friday night were touched by it. The music was Shostakovich and 
Prokofiev, the two most talented composers of the Soviet school and 
therefore the two to suffer most at its hands. Yuri Temirkanov conducted 
this second of three programs. Shostakovich's ``Festive'' Overture, 
his Second Violin Concerto and the Prokofiev Seventh Symphony were 
all written after 1950 (Stalin died in 1953), but none could be thought 
of as very new. The overture harvests every martial and folk dance 
mannerism cultivated over the last 100 years. Brass blares for a while 
and then everyone else engages in cheerful fast footwork. Cliches 
they are, but they are cliches in the hands of a master. Surprise 
often interrupts the familiar turns of phrase. This brief and Politburo-pleasing 
piece is one of those moments when Shostakovich seems to have had 
all the sarcasm scared out of him. It returns plentifully, however, 
in the violin concerto, a difficult piece played brilliantly here 
by Gidon Kremer. The three movements offer little happiness; nor do 
they make a pretense of beauty in the usual sense. The textures are 
hard and nasty. The tone is depressive if not downright despondent, 
and yet one finds an eloquence. Masquerading as high spirits, the 
busy finale reminds one of a rustic dancer fighting the effects of 
a hangover. The Prokofiev symphony, one of his last pieces, is depressing 
for other reasons. Its good cheer and soaring sentiments, none of 
which would hurt a fly, have been purged of the bitter wit that made 
a younger Prokofiev so interesting, and which Shostakovich managed 
to horde until the end. The Allegretto is wobbly waltz time; the finale 
is embarrassingly sincere. The Seventh has lovely touches, but all 
the fight has gone out of it. It is difficult to describe the sound 
of the St. Petersburg because it differs so vastly from any other 
orchestra I know. The word ``rich'' springs to mind when talking about 
the string and brass playing, but this is not richness in the sense 
of mega-caloric food. Rather the sound is deep without being heavy, 
powerful but not tough, alive but never nervous. The more this interesting 
orchestra plays in the West the more it is going to lose its hometown 
quality, so I suggest hearing these musicians while they still represent 
one specific place and no other.
