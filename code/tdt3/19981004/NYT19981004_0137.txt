Though the subject of mortality is at the heart of ``Late August, 
Early September,'' this latest film by Olivier Assayas studiously 
avoids an air of life-or-death urgency. Assayas, a filmmaker capable 
of both subtle intensity (``Wild Reeds'') and sneaky wit (``Irma Vep''), 
this time takes a tastefully oblique approach to his material. Though 
his film centers on the death of a middle-aged man and its effect 
on the friends around him, Assayas concentrates on myopic egos and 
changing relationships rather than morbidity or pain. The film shows 
at least as much interest in texture _ smoking, eating, shrugging, 
kissing _ as in fully grasping its characters' malaise. The ailing 
man is Adrien (Francois Cluzet), a serious writer of overlooked books, 
but he is not the film's main focus. Interestingly, Assayas concentrates 
on Adrien's friend Gabriel (Mathieu Amalric), whose equilibrium is 
in flux during the course of the story. Always slightly intimidated 
by Adrien and tacitly competitive with him, Gabriel responds in complex 
ways to his friend's ill health. At the same time, Gabriel is also 
diffidently involved with two women: Jenny (Jeanne Balibar), the steady 
old flame he's in the process of leaving, and Anne (Virginie Ledoyen), 
the free spirit with whom he's having an affair. These players seem 
pensive, sensual and attractive in ways that help deflect attention 
from the film's discreetly soapy side. Amalric, a rumpled, perpetually 
astonished-looking actor with a seductive gleam in his eye, is memorable 
for having played a similar role in Arnaud Desplechin's wiser and 
more passionate ``My Sex Life ... or How I Got Into an Argument.'' 
Ms. Balibar, who also appeared in ``My Sex Life,'' brings warmth and 
quirky charm to the lonely woman who manages to remain everybody's 
friend. Cluzet is as grave and thoughtful as the screenplay makes 
him, though perhaps not as cruel (Arsinee Khanjian plays his bitter 
ex-lover). And Ms. Ledoyen, in decadent bohemian mode here, is one 
of the great beauties of contemporary French cinema. ``Do I look like 
a bimbo from Paris?'' her Anne asks Gabriel coyly as he brings her 
to dinner in the country with too many of Jenny's old friends. This 
is the sort of film in which even Anne's kinky streak is given a pretty 
gloss, and in which she smokes soulfully while announcing, ``I don't 
love you,'' to a man with whom she's just had a supposedly wild encounter. 
``I know,'' he answers, eating a chicken drumstick as food for thought. 
Assayas gives the film a self-consciously natural look (with hand-held 
camera work). And he structures it as a series of indirect glimpses 
into these people and the various entanglements in their lives. The 
effect is meant to be enhanced through juxtapositions (he has compared 
this to David Hockney's fragmented landscapes made of Polaroids), 
but it often stays muted and remote. The film is most insightful about 
the mix of love and rivalry between Adrien and Gabriel, and the effect 
of a friend's mortal illness on a 40-ish man who still clings to some 
of his adolescent streak. (``You die and you're a genius,'' Gabriel 
says cruelly after the fact.) The endless round of romantic standoffs 
seems more mundane and mechanical, with exhaustive talk of the ``You 
dumped Jean-Paul really hard'' variety. If Assayas doesn't always 
transport his film's events beyond the all too commonplace, his understatement 
can also yield moments of quiet simplicity. Adrien's illness is made 
most affecting not by outright grief but by his straightforward remark:
