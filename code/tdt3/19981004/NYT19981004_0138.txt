Joe Lockhart is realistic about his new job as President Clinton's 
press secretary. ``I'm sure something horrible will happen'' right 
away, he said, in this his first full week on the job. His predecessor, 
Mike McCurry, who defended the administration through eight months 
of scandal, spent day after day telling reporters that he could not 
say, did not know and did not want to know much about the president's 
relationship with a former intern. And that he would not parse _ repeat, 
would not parse _ that statement. Even in his final days in the post, 
McCurry had to explain the difference between covering up a third-rate 
burglary and concealing a third-rate romance. Still, McCurry did keep 
White House reporters laughing, and in his farewell performance last 
Thursday, most applauded him for so charmingly deflecting their questions. 
And like McCurry _ who insists it was his deputy, Lockhart, who came 
up with many of his best lines _ the president's new chief mouthpiece 
is inclined to fall back on humor as the scandal coverage continues. 
One particularly well-received comic riff came after the president's 
latest trip to Moscow, where Lockhart overslept and missed his ride 
to Belfast on Air Force One. When the press secretary-elect finally 
caught up with his group in Northern Ireland, he offered a mock apology 
for his late arrival in the words Clinton had used to explain his 
relationship with the former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky _ 
words that, up until that point in the trip, had not provided a lot 
of hearty yucks for the president's gloomy entourage. ``I take responsibility 
for my own actions,'' the tardy Lockhart told reporters. ``I deeply 
regret it. I'm dealing with the people I have hurt the most. And I'll 
have nothing further to say.'' He said later that he thought it was 
worth making a little fun of himself and even the president in an 
effort to lighten the mood on the trip. Lunching outdoors at a restaurant 
near the White House last week, Lockhart immediately made light of 
his new situation, asking for a table in the shade and muttering, 
``I'll be sweating enough soon.'' A few minutes later, when he spied 
the president's personal secretary, Betty Currie, of grand jury fame, 
walking down the street, they both cracked up and waved like it had 
been years. But, facing tough times and a generally tough crowd, with 
McCurry a very tough act to follow, Lockhart also communicated a proper 
appreciation of what he is up against. ``We have a problem now after 
the president acknowledged misleading'' the country about his relationship 
with Ms. Lewinsky, he said. ``We have to build back that trust.'' 
And then there is the related challenge of how to focus the public 
on administration initiatives that he said are typically reported 
in sentences that begin, ``In an attempt to change the subject ...,'' 
or ``In an attempt to appear presidential ...'' Still, Lockhart, who 
has worked in both politics and journalism since college, did campaign 
for this promotion _ a position that friends said he had been preparing 
for all his adult life. Kind of like the president? ``I don't know 
if at 14 he shook Walter Cronkite's hand and there's video of it, 
but, yeah,'' said Lockhart's friend Dayton Duncan, who worked with 
him on both the Mondale and Dukakis campaigns, referring to famous 
footage of a young Bill Clinton, student leader, meeting President 
John F. Kennedy. Lockhart was born into a family of journalists. His 
late father, Raymond Lockhart, and mother, Ann Teahan Lockhart, both 
worked for NBC News in New York. His wife, Laura Logan, is also a 
journalist who quit a senior position with ABC to care for the couple's 
4-year-old daughter. At 39, with graying hair and a sturdy build, 
Lockhart is a New York Mets and Bruce Springsteen fan who comes across 
like a regular guy you would probably enjoy having a beer with. Ms. 
Logan says one of the premier challenges of her husband's new job 
will be the longer hours that will make it harder to get home to read 
their daughter, Clare, her favorite bedtime story, ``Little Bear.'' 
White House colleagues note that this is the rare instance of a nice-guy 
understudy who got the starring role by working hard. Still, he has 
not always been warm and fuzzy with the press, and must break out 
of the ``bad cop'' role that he played opposite McCurry's ``good cop.'' 
The role of campaign press secretary often requires a sharper and 
more partisan tongue than the White House job, and even after he went 
to work as McCurry's deputy, it was Lockhart who invariably called 
reporters at all hours to complain about negative stories, and sometimes 
lost his temper in the process. ``He'll have to go through the transition 
of no longer playing pit bull to Mike's golden retriever rolling over 
and letting you scratch his belly,'' said Dee Dee Myers, who preceded 
McCurry as Clinton's press secretary. Lockhart says he knows he will 
need to take a step back in the top job. ``The best press secretaries 
can detach,'' he says, ``and I still have some work to do on that.'' 
And there are other challenges even beyond managing the continuing 
scandal and meeting the standard set by McCurry: He's got to prove 
that he has the same access to the president that McCurry enjoyed 
_ when he wanted it. (The president and Lockhart have a good but not 
terribly close relationship, by all accounts, and Lockhart is not 
confused about its limits, referring to it as ``a business relationship,'' 
and saying, ``I'm the hired help and glad to be the hired help.'') 
Also, he is not as experienced in foreign policy as McCurry, who came 
to the White House from the State Department. In his favor is his 
experience in this White House, and his years as a journalist for 
three television networks, which have given him an unusual understanding 
of the news profession, how it works and does not work. ``People in 
my business are quick to judge the motives of the journalist,'' he 
said. ``But I understand how random the business is.'' After McCurry, 
whom he had known on the Mondale campaign, recruited him as chief 
spokesman for Clinton's 1996 campaign, he signed on, he said, because 
of a basic ideological compatibility with the president. And now that 
he has McCurry's job, other former presidential press secretaries 
expressed not only sympathy for his difficult assignment, but confidence 
in his ability. ``He's good, with a nice mix of humor and rough-and-tumble, 
and nobody's going to blame him if things don't go well,'' said George 
Stephanopoulos, the former Clinton adviser who rates his own tenure 
as a White House briefer as ``no good.'' Marlin Fitzwater, the former 
Bush and Reagan press secretary, offered this view: ``It's the greatest 
job in the world and worth taking no matter how much trouble your 
president is in. Now, you may die in the job, it may ruin your life, 
and your reputation. But it still will have been the greatest experience 
of your life.''
