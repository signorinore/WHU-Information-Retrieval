Elliott Smith has been performing for the last few years alone with 
his acoustic guitar, singing in a quiet, wispy voice. But he is no 
folk singer; he is, instead, a pop craftsman who rethinks structure 
with every song. Now he has hooked up with a band, Quasi, who played 
its own set and backed him up at Tramps on Saturday night. (Quasi's 
guitarist and keyboardist, Sam Coomes, used to be with Smith in Heatmiser, 
their late-1980s band in Portland, Ore.) The merger pushes Smith's 
songs toward their true roots, even as it trades away some subtlety. 
Smith is a fan of the Beatles, the Beach Boys and the more obscure 
groups who, particularly in the 1960s, concealed unlikely chord changes 
and uncompromising lyrics behind graceful melodies. He uses many of 
the Beatles' trademark devices, among them the bounce of British music-hall 
rhythms and chords that turn from major to minor and back. Yet he 
is no throwback. True to his collegiate 1990s audience, he sings about 
drinking, drugs, failure and love gone wrong; sometimes he lashes 
out, and sometimes he calmly observes people going under. And the 
music, like a drug itself, provides the illusion of comfort. On Smith's 
new album, ``XO'' (Dreamworks/Geffen), the arrangements use largely 
acoustic instruments with a band materializing now and then. With 
Quasi, however, the songs were Merseybeat all the way, with Smith 
strumming an electric guitar and Janet Weiss on drums and Coomes on 
bass kicking up sturdy midtempo rock, cruising easily through the 
hidden complexities of Smith's tunes. Most of the songs were from 
``XO'' and Smith's previous album, ``Either/Or'' (Kill Rock Stars); 
he didn't play ``Miss Misery,'' the song written for the movie ``Good 
Will Hunting'' and nominated for an Academy Award. The harder arrangements 
made Smith shift his voice from the Art Garfunkel tone of his solo 
performances to something with more backbone, bringing out the sullen 
defiance in lyrics like ``I'm never going to become what you became.'' 
But the band risked making Smith sound simply like a Beatles imitator, 
closing off the alternatives he produced on his album and limiting 
the arrangements a fan can imagine when he performs by himself. Smith 
did play a few songs alone _ on electric guitar, not acoustic _ and 
they became a little more tender; he saved ``Say Yes,'' one of his 
few optimistic songs, to play as a solo, keeping it tentative. Quasi, 
which performed as a duo and in some songs with Smith on bass, played 
more aggressive, equally tuneful pop songs with two main subjects: 
the dehumanization of working people and the precariousness of love. 
Coomes, on keyboards, propelled the songs with steady repeating chords 
in the style of mid-1960s garage rock, and then veered into avant-garde 
dissonance, the chaos from which the order of pop could emerge. Ms. 
Weiss was pure muscle on the drums and a sweet descant when she sang. 
If things are headed downhill fast, as Quasi's lyrics insist, at least 
there's something to hum during the collapse.
