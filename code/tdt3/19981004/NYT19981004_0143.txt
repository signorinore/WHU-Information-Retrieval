NEW YORK _ ``Dances Old and New'' was the name of the program presented 
by the Mary Anthony Dance Theater on Saturday night at the Merce Cunningham 
Studio. The six pieces did span three decades. But it was the ``old'' 
that distinguished this satisfying evening, from a choreographic emphasis 
on solid craft to big, emotionally committed, weighted dancing. Kun-Yang 
Lin, Ms. Anthony's young artistic protege, has grown measurably in 
the year since his work was first presented by Ms. Anthony's company. 
Lin's new ``Passages/Three Aspects,'' a suite of sleek, focused solos, 
made imaginative use of its scores, drew strong performances from 
its dancers and allowed three shimmering worlds to emerge from darkness. 
Nai-Yu Kuo moved from contemplative sadness to frenzied anguish in 
``Lachrymose,'' the first of the solos, set to music by Dmitri Yanov-Yanovsky. 
In ``Renascence,'' danced to music by Quentin Chiappetta, Kori Darling 
emerged slowly, pale and seemingly nude, from a ragged chrysalis of 
red tulle. Sandra Antognazzi's strikingly quiet, powerful presence 
made each stretched calligraphic pose count in ``For M.A.'' The closing 
solo was set to music by Chiappetti and to Ms. Anthony's soft-voiced 
reading of an E.E. Cummings poem that celebrated ``everything which 
is yes.'' Lin is not afraid of bold imagery, so it was not surprising 
that he would so forcefully evoke the lethal paranoia of Muriel Cohan's 
``Caligula,'' a 1973 solo that is both a horrific portrait and a study 
of tension and release. Gwendolyn Bye was as riveting in a sumptuous 
performance of the lead role in Ms. Anthony's gutsy, lyrical 1967 
``Gloria,'' set to the Poulenc score. Another highlight was Mary Ford's 
simple, luminous performance of Ms. Anthony's ``Magdalen,'' a New 
York premiere set to traditional madrigals and music by Henrik Gorecki 
and inspired by the paintings of Georges de la Tour. Ms. Ford's old-school 
clarity and devotion added greatly to this psychological portrait, 
seen in flashback memories, of an innocent grown wise. The program 
was completed by Lin's breezy new ``Aperitif II'' and his less focused 
``Luminous Song.'' John Musall was the evening's imaginative lighting 
designer.
