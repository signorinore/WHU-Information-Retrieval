David Cone carried a Yankee cap with him to Columbia-Presbyterian 
Medical Center in Manhattan Sunday for Darryl Strawberry, a cap with 
Strawberry's No. 39 embroidered on it. Cone knew that Strawberry had 
seen the caps on television, but he wanted to give him a cap in person 
and remind his teammate just how much he meant to the Yankees. Strawberry 
underwent surgery to remove a cancerous tumor from his colon on Saturday, 
and Cone and manager Joe Torre were among a group of Yankees who visited 
him in the hospital less than 24 hours later. They represented the 
close-knit team, whose players and coaches had been anxious to see 
Strawberry and let him know he was in their thoughts as they played 
on in the postseason without him. ``We're all concerned about him,'' 
Cone said. ``We want to see how he's doing. We want to let him know 
that we got the message and we did what he asked us to do. It will 
be nice to see him face to face and tell him how much we care.'' Strawberry 
had videotaped a message to the Yankees on Friday in which he said: 
``Go get 'em tonight, guys. Get 'em.'' The Yankees listened, and then 
they throttled the Texas Rangers, 4-0, in Game 3 of the division series 
in Arlington, Texas. They face the Cleveland Indians in Game 1 of 
the American League Championship Series Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium. 
Before Cone, Torre and others, including Andy Pettitte, Chili Davis, 
Derek Jeter, Tim Raines and Tino Martinez, met with Strawberry for 
about an hour Sunday afternoon after a workout at Yankee Stadium, 
he had sent them another message through Dr. Stuart Hershon. Hershon, 
the Yankees' team physician, met with Strawberry in the hospital Sunday 
and then spoke with the players at the stadium about Strawberry's 
condition. Doctors said there was no visible evidence during surgery 
that the cancer had spread beyond the area of the bowel. ``Dr. Hershon 
was in to see Darryl this morning,'' Torre said. ``He said that he 
felt good, very alert. He's obviously sore, but very upbeat about 
the news that everything was fine. Again, he reiterated to Dr. Hershon 
about finishing the job we started.'' That job is winning the World 
Series. That would satisfy George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal 
owner, who spent five hours with Strawberry and his wife, Charisse, 
on Saturday. ``I don't really want to get into it, but he's up,'' 
Steinbrenner said Sunday. ``He's upbeat.'' The reserve infielder Luis 
Sojo was not part of the contingent that visited Strawberry Sunday, 
but he said the entire team planned to visit Strawberry at Columbia-Presbyterian 
after Monday's workout if it is feasible for Strawberry. ``We all 
want to see him in person,'' Sojo said. ``We all want to see how he's 
doing. Tomorrow, after the workout, we're all going to go up.'' Sojo 
was one of several Yankees who flipped from channel to channel Saturday 
searching for any news on Strawberry's condition. On their flight 
from Dallas to New York that morning, the Yankees had talked about 
how Strawberry was scheduled to begin his surgery as they were flying 
home. Once the players learned that doctors had deemed Strawberry's 
three-hour surgery successful, some of their anxieties dissipated. 
``I think there's a lot of sense of relief,'' Martinez said. ``We 
know he has a lot of work to do. It's a better feeling in here now.'' 
Sojo added: ``The first thing I did when I got home was turn on the 
TV. When I heard them say he was fine, it kind of completed my day.'' 
Still, the Yankees were cautious about what they said. As relieved 
as they were by the doctors' positive statements, they realized it 
would be about a week before key pathology tests would allow doctors 
to classify the severity of the cancer, and determine what kind of 
therapy, such as drugs and radiation, to recommend. So Strawberry 
and the Yankees must wait for more news about his condition. ``We 
can talk all we want to, but it's a scary situation,'' Paul O'Neill 
said. ``It started off on a good note, obviously. The surgery is the 
No. 1 step. From what the doctors said, there were no setbacks. You 
go on from here.'' Strawberry's teammates are not the only people 
who are concerned about him. Danny Mecka, a 12-year-old Little Leaguer 
from Lodi, N.J., played second base in a game Sunday and then switched 
to a Yankee cap and ventured to Columbia-Presbyterian. Mecka left 
an oversized get-well card for Strawberry at the front desk of the 
hospital, a card that stated simply what many others are thinking. 
``To Strawberry,'' the card read, ``I always looked up to you when 
I was young. Get well.''
