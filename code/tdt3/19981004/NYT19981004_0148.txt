The White House said Sunday that ``troubling questions'' had been 
raised about the actions of Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth 
Starr and his office in seeking to expand its original inquiry to 
include accusations of a relationship between President Clinton and 
Monica Lewinsky. The White House was responding to an article on Sunday 
in The New York Times reporting that a lawyer involved in the Paula 
Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit provided the first tip to Starr's 
office about the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a former 
White House intern. In the Whitewater independent counsel's impeachment 
report to Congress, though, Starr said that his office was first informed 
about the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship by Linda Tripp, who had been 
a Pentagon colleague of Ms. Lewinsky. Presidential adviser James Kennedy 
said in a statement issued Sunday that the Times article prompted 
new questions about the work of Starr's office. ``In sum, what did 
the OIC know, and when did it know it?'' Kennedy asked. He said the 
White House would review whether Starr was ``complete and accurate 
in disclosing information'' to Attorney General Janet Reno when he 
sought permission, which was quickly granted, to expand his inquiry 
into the president's finances to include the Lewinsky matter. In a 
sign that the White House plans to make the question a major issue, 
presidential aides were weighing Sunday the implications of the disclosures 
and how to draw further public attention to them. The issue was taken 
up Sunday by Democrats on Capitol Hill, where the House Judiciary 
Committee is to begin debate Monday on whether to recommend formal 
impeachment proceedings. James Jordan, a spokesman for the Democrats 
on the Judiciary Committee, said that Starr has shown a consistent 
pattern of making misleading statements. ``Ken Starr has engaged in 
precisely the same conduct _ that is, making statements that are technically 
accurate but intentionally misleading _ that he contends are grounds 
for impeachment for the president of the United States,'' Jordan said. 
According to the Times article, at least a week before Mrs. Tripp 
contacted Starr's office on Jan. 12, Jerome Marcus, a Philadelphia 
lawyer, informed a law-school friend working for Starr of the accusations 
related to Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Starr might have 
used the tip to prepare an early strategy to persuade the Justice 
Department to expand the scope of the stalled Whitewater inquiry. 
The strategy was based on pursuing a purported pattern by Clinton 
of silencing potentially harmful witnesses through job offers organized 
by Clinton's friend, Vernon Jordan. Marcus is one of a group of conservative 
lawyers who helped the Jones legal team and then secretly helped Mrs. 
Tripp find a lawyer and bring her accusations to Starr's attention. 
The group included Richard Porter, a law partner of Starr's at the 
Chicago firm of Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, and George Conway, a partner 
at Wachtell Lipton Rosen &AMP; Katz in New York. Clinton's lawyers, 
political aides and Hillary Rodham Clinton have complained for months 
of a right-wing conspiracy against the president, contending that 
Mrs. Jones' lawyers fed Starr's inquiry. The Justice Department had 
no official comment Sunday on the Times article. But the Justice Department's 
position has been that barring convincing evidence that Starr's office 
knowingly and materially misled Justice Department officials, there 
is no reason to reopen the question of whether it was correct to expand 
Starr's mandate to include Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly denied any impropriety or effort to 
mislead. He said that the office did receive a ``heads-up call that 
some information may be coming or may be out there.'' But he would 
not specify who made the call or who received it, and he characterized 
the information provided as ``vague'' and ``sketchy.'' Bakaly insisted, 
``As far as we were concerned, we didn't get this information until 
the 12th, until Linda Tripp called.''
