When they were Dolphins teammates for four seasons, Keith Byars often 
saw that look in Dan Marino's eyes. And when he saw that look again 
Sunday on Marino's 2-yard touchdown pass to Troy Drayton with more 
than five minutes remaining, he warned his Jets teammates about the 
37-year-old quarterback who still throws lasers. ``I know the mind-set 
of No. 13,'' Byars said later, alluding to Marino. ``We'd given him 
one opportunity. I knew we couldn't give him another opportunity. 
I knew we had to put a drive together.'' And the Jets' offense did 
just that. Vinny Testaverde moved the ball 68 yards in 11 plays to 
position John Hall's 25-yard field goal that assured a 20-9 victory. 
On two of those plays, Byars caught passes for 17 and 11 yards. Overall, 
he had six catches for 71 yards. ``He's lost a step or two,'' Jets 
Coach Bill Parcells said later of the 34-year-old Byars, ``but this 
guy can make plays when it counts.'' That's why Parcells has hired 
Byars twice _ in 1996 for the New England Patriots after the Dolphins 
released him, and again early this year after the Patriots released 
him. Parcells had remembered Byars from his years as the Giants' coach 
when Byars was on the Philadelphia Eagles. ``He knows how to play 
the game,'' Parcells said. There are more than 1,500 players in pro 
football, but that doesn't mean each one is a professional football 
player in the real sense of the phrase. Byars is a professional football 
player, an old pro who seldom makes a mistake, who understands the 
psychology of the long, grinding season. ``We're 2-2 after one quarter 
of the season,'' he said, ``but to me the games from 5 through 10 
are the most important. Everybody gets excited at the beginning and 
again at the end, but Games 5 through 10 are when teams get separated. 
You've got to be excited then, too.'' At a bull-shouldered 257 pounds, 
Byars is listed as the Jets' backup fullback behind Jerald Sowell, 
but Sunday he was the starter. ``I tell people, `I just play offense,''' 
Byars said. ``Running back, tight end, pass receiver, whatever helps 
my team win.'' In addition to his 3,088 career rushing yards, Byars 
has caught 593 passes, six more than Marcus Allen, the former Chief 
and Raider, with whom he had shared the unofficial record for most 
receptions by a running back. Roger Craig, the former 49er, had 566 
and Tony Galbreath, a Giant near the end of his career, had 490. ``I 
remember playing against Galbreath,'' Byars said. ``I'd say, `Don't 
throw it to that guy; he can make a play.' I wanted to be one of those 
guys you could count on to make a play.'' Parcells remembered Byars 
throwing an option pass for the Eagles that beat the Giants. He also 
remembered Byars knocking out Pepper Johnson, then a Giant linebacker, 
with a block. Johnson, who was Byars' teammate at Ohio State, remembered 
that knockout, too. ``I was chasing Randall Cunningham,'' Johnson 
recalled, ``and Keith took me out. But after the game, we went out 
to dinner. Playing against him in the NFL was the scariest part because 
we never blocked or tackled each other in college.'' Now both Johnson 
and Byars are the old-pro type that Parcells cherishes. One of Parcells' 
first moves as the Jets' major-domo was to sign Johnson, the linebacker 
who had been on both Giants teams that won the Super Bowl under him. 
And when Byars was at liberty, Parcells grabbed him. On a Jets team 
with so many young players, Byars and Johnson are worth their weight 
in wisdom. ``We do some awfully dumb things,'' Parcells said, without 
naming Sunday's culprits. ``Some of these players that continue to 
do them, they're going to have to either change their ways or I'm 
not going to be playing them anymore, because it's about to cost us.'' 
The Jets can't risk doing dumb things on Sunday in St. Louis, where 
the Rams are 1-3, before their Oct. 19 Monday night visit to New England. 
The Patriots, who are 3-1 after a 30-27 overtime scare in New Orleans, 
share first place in the American Football Conference East with Miami. 
``If we want to do some things in January, we have to take care of 
business now,'' Byars said. ``You can't put off for next week what 
you can do now.'' That's a professional football player speaking. 
And that's why Bill Parcells wanted Keith Byars on the Jets: to show 
the younger players how a professional football player performs, especially 
in the last five minutes of a tense game when he recognized the mind-set 
of the opposing quarterback wearing No. 13.
