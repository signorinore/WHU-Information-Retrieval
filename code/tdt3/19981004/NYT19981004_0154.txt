One week after they were ordered back into Nassau Coliseum by a judge, 
the Islanders played in the arena Sunday for the first time since 
last season. But there was no confetti, no streamers welcoming them 
home. Instead, there was a small crowd of angry fans. Some booed, 
some wore hard hats and others held up signs expressing frustration 
or disappointment aimed at the ownership, which has tried to move 
the teams' home games and has yet to sign Zigmund Palffy or Trevor 
Linden, two of their best players. Even at $10 a seat _ season ticket-holders 
got in free _ fewer than 3,000 people showed up Sunday night to watch 
the Islanders lose a preseason game to the Washington Capitals, 5-3. 
Many fans feel alienated by the Islanders' new owners, who for the 
past month tried unsuccessfully to move their team's home games all 
over the East Coast. The Islanders said the scoreboard at the Coliseum 
was in danger of falling from the ceiling. Engineers hired by the 
National Hockey League and Nassau County later rebuffed that contention, 
making the owners' allegations of unsafe conditions seem like a plan 
to void their lease. ``We're very angry,'' said 28-year- old Pete 
Minichiello of White Plains, who said he was a season ticket holder 
the past four years. ``The new owners have promised so much, but they 
haven't done anything. They don't care. It's ridiculous, a joke.'' 
The fans' anger seemed to be directed more at the Islanders' organization 
than Nassau County or SMG, the company that maintains the 26-year-old 
Nassau Coliseum. A young girl, wearing a sweater autographed by every 
member of the Islanders, held up a sign with the message: ``Stop wrecking 
our team.'' Midway through the second period, with Islanders trailing 
2-1, the crowd began to chant: ``We want Ziggy. We want Ziggy.'' But 
it seems the only way they'll have him now is if the Islanders pay 
the 26-year-old right wing, who scored 87 points last season, the 
$6.8 million per season he is seeking. ``It's upsetting,'' said Dave 
Burrus, who is from Yonkers and bought season tickets for the first 
time earlier this year. ``I don't think the owners are as devoted 
as they said they were. It seems to me that they are willing to throw 
the whole season away over a bad lease.'' Doug Magee, another season-ticket 
holder, said he sent four letters pleading for the team to play its 
games on Long Island, and for the Islanders to sign Palffy and Linden 
and did not receive a single response. ``I don't really know and I 
don't really care,'' the Islanders Coach and General Manager Mike 
Milbury said before Sunday night's game, referring to the number of 
fans he expected to attend. ``I'm not concerned about it. ``We've 
played games in sparse buildings before,'' Milbury added. ``Hopefully, 
we've got enough veterans to handle it.'' The line of questioning 
caused Milbury to lose his patience. ``Ask me some hockey questions,'' 
he said. ``We expected this size crowd,'' said Islanders president 
David Seldin. ``I can understand why the fans feel angry and frustrated. 
It's been a tough road for our fans and we haven't done right by them.''
