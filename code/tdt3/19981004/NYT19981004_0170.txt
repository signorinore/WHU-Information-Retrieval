In the closing minutes Sunday, as the Jets were running the clock 
down to almost nothing and putting the game out of reach, Dan Marino 
stood near midfield, away from his Miami Dolphins teammates, one foot 
on the field. He was anxiously waiting for another chance that never 
came. As anxious as Marino might have been, the Jets were equally 
anxious. Marino has been a Jet killer over his career, dominating 
them in a way that no other quarterback has dominated an opponent. 
And after spending most of the game handing off and looking very ordinary, 
in the fourth quarter he was starting to look like the Marino that 
the Jets know and fear. But after he pulled the Dolphins within a 
touchdown, the Jets put the game away with a field goal in the final 
minute, stranding Marino on the sideline in a 20-9 Jets victory. Marino, 
37, has been a different quarterback this season, deferring to an 
improved running game as Miami has strived for balance on offense 
rather than relying on his arm. On the last drive of the third quarter, 
the Dolphins ran the ball three straight times. It wasn't until the 
fourth quarter, with the Dolphins trailing by 17-3, that Marino opened 
up the offense, completing 6-of-13 passes for 80 yards in a drive 
that cut the deficit to 17-9. It was the 23rd consecutive game that 
he had thrown a touchdown pass against the Jets. ``Our game plan was 
to be balanced, and it's going to probably continue to be that,'' 
Marino said. ``I don't know how many times we threw it, but we were 
talking about trying to open it up some. Coming in, we thought that 
we would be able to run the ball better than we did.'' Miami's running 
game was ineffective, producing just 34 yards on 15 carries, and for 
once, the Jets got the better of Marino, sacking him three times. 
The last time the Jets got to Marino more than once in a game was 
Sept. 12, 1993 _ not coincidentally, the last time that they beat 
him. He had recorded seven consecutive victories over the Jets since 
then. Marino completed just 13-of-31 passes Sunday, his worst completion 
percentage ever against the Jets, and was picked off twice, once on 
a desperation pass at the end of the first half. Marino credited the 
Jets, rather than blaming Coach Jimmy Johnson's conservative game 
plan. ``I'm frustrated when we lose,'' Marino said. ``There were chances 
where I could have made throws. They had a pretty good scheme. I've 
got to find a way to make some throws that are going to help this 
team. We just didn't have enough offense today to stay in the game.''
