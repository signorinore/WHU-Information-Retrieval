When Warren Sapp watched a teammate return a New York Giants pass 
for an early Tampa Bay touchdown Sunday, the defensive tackle started 
yelling. ``Now it's up to us,'' Sapp told his defensive teammates. 
``Let's hunker down against the run. Danny Kanell is not going to 
beat us passing.'' Sapp's words came true. Kanell settled for just 
83 yards passing, on 10 of 27 accuracy, as the Buccaneers' defense 
was the difference in a 20-3 victory over the Giants before 64,989 
fans at Raymond James Stadium. ``We have mirrorlike teams,'' Sapp 
said. ``We're not going to ask our quarterback to throw the ball 40 
times to beat somebody. Neither are they. We're going to run the ball. 
They're going to run the ball. It boiled down to which defense was 
going to play the best.'' The Bucs' defensive superiority became evident 
only in the final quarter as the tough Giant defense began wearing 
down in the 86-degree heat. That's when the hosts managed their only 
offensive touchdown, a 1-yard run by Mike Alstott. ``We live in the 
heat and we practice in the heat,'' Tampa Bay Coach Tony Dungy said. 
``Call it a home-field advantage if you like.'' Dungy, stung by his 
team's 1-3 start after last season's taste of the playoffs, actually 
told his players on Wednesday that Sunday's game was a must-win. ``That's 
very much unlike Tony to say something like that,'' cornerback Donnie 
Abraham said. ``So we knew we all had to dig a little deeper.'' Free 
safety Charles Mincy provided just the jump-start the Bucs needed 
with his 22-yard interception of a Kanell pass for a touchdown just 
1 minute 34 seconds into the game. It was the team's first defensive 
touchdown since Dungy became head coach three seasons ago with a reputation 
for having opportunistic defenses. And it was the first Bucs touchdown 
for Mincy, an eighth-year pro, who followed Dungy from Kansas City 
to Minnesota and now here. ``It was a relief more than anything,'' 
Mincy said. ``That's what we've been looking to do.'' Mincy said Giants 
running back Tiki Barber simply turned one way on a pass pattern and 
the pass went the other way _ right to Mincy. ``I didn't look up until 
the ball was on me,'' he said. ``I'm a little surprised I caught it.'' 
Sapp added, ``I don't know what Kanell was thinking, but thank you.'' 
The Bucs had tricked the Giants into thinking they were playing zone 
defense. ``Normally we play zone early in games,'' Dungy said. ``But 
on that play, we jumped into man-to-man.'' The Tampa Bay coach came 
in leery of the Giants' defense. ``They have a tough front seven to 
get anything done against,'' Dungy said. ``They jump into a lot of 
different fronts and they work together well. We really didn't do 
much against them today.'' The Bucs could manage just a field goal 
offensively against that defense until the game's late stages. ``But 
I think when you look at it, our defense shut down their offense better 
than vice versa,'' said Abraham, the cornerback. ``When their offense 
had to make plays against us, they couldn't do it.'' Meanwhile, Tampa 
Bay's ground-oriented offense put the game away in the fading minutes. 
``When we put a rushing game together like we did today, and stick 
to it, we're tough for anybody to beat,'' Alstott said. ``I do think 
we wore them down. You could see some of them were getting pretty 
tired. We're the type of offense that comes at you for eight, 10, 
12 plays, most of them runs. That's tough to defend after a while.'' 
Alstott rushed for 86 yards, while Warrick Dunn added 63. Bucs quarterback 
Trent Dilfer was under no illusion about the main reason his team 
prevailed. ``It would have been difficult to win this game if our 
defense had not played as well as they played,'' he said. Mincy's 
touchdown shed light on just what a drought the Tampa Bay offense 
has been in this season. It was the team's first touchdown in the 
first half of any game. ``But they say those types of things run in 
bunches,'' Dungy said. ``So that makes me hopeful.'' The Bucs now 
have a week off to mull over their good fortune against the Giants. 
Sapp said he could only surmise what the team atmosphere would be 
like if it had lost Sunday. ``I don't know, it might have driven a 
wedge between this team,'' he said. ``I'm just glad I don't have to 
find out.''
