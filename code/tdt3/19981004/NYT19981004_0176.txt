George Steinbrenner elicited smiles easily from Derek Jeter and Tino 
Martinez as they chatted behind the batting cage. Tim Raines and Jorge 
Posada, who are normally nowhere near second base during real games, 
turned fancy double plays. Teammates teased Hideki Irabu and Orlando 
Hernandez whenever one of their offerings was torched during rare 
batting practice sessions for both restless pitchers. It was a day 
of R and R for the Yankees, relief and relaxation. They were relieved 
to return to Yankee Stadium knowing Darryl Strawberry had what doctors 
termed successful surgery to remove a cancerous tumor from his colon 
on Saturday, and they were relieved to be pondering Tuesday's opener 
of the American League Championship Series against Cleveland. That 
is why a team that had looked tense on Thursday and even early in 
Friday's game looked so relaxed in a drizzling rain. ``The thing to 
do now,'' Manager Joe Torre said, ``is to get back to the World Series.'' 
To accomplish that, the favored Yankees must defeat the team that 
bounced them from the division series last season. It was memorable 
and painful and, no matter how the Yankees minimized the revenge questions, 
those feelings surely exist. How could they not feel vengeful when 
the Indians prevented the Yankees from staying alive to possibly win 
their second straight title by dramatically swiping the last two games 
of a five-game series? ``It's certainly something that you could speculate 
about, that if we had gotten by Cleveland and got to the World Series, 
we could be going for No. 3,'' said David Cone, who was flip-flopped 
with Andy Pettitte in the rotation and will start Game 2. ``But it 
didn't happen. Maybe that is why we won 114 games. Maybe last year 
was such a slap in the face that guys were motivated in the off season.'' 
Motivation will not be a problem, not with Strawberry watching from 
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center and not with the Indians' Jaret 
Wright opposing David Wells in Game 1. Wright, who tamed the Yankees 
twice in the division series last year and who perturbed them by throwing 
inside so recklessly that he broke Luis Sojo's left hand in a spring 
training game in March, may be the player most disliked within the 
Yankee clubhouse. Torre initially feigned ignorance when asked about 
Wright's failure to appear on any Christmas card lists in the Bronx, 
and most Yankees bit their tongues regarding the 22-year-old pitcher. 
``He tried to hit me in the face,'' Sojo said. ``He never said nothing 
to me after that. If you're going to hit somebody, don't do that. 
We all have families. The best way to deal with it is to sweep these 
guys, win this thing and get to the World Series.'' The potential 
path to that goal changed as Torre tweaked his rotation from the division 
series by switching Cone and Pettitte. Cone will start Game 2 on Wednesday 
afternoon against Charles Nagy and Pettitte will pitch Game 3 in Cleveland 
versus Dwight Gooden on Friday, so Cone will get an extra day of rest 
before a potential Game 6 and avoid what is bound to be colder weather 
at Jacobs Field. Hernandez will face Bartolo Colon in Game 4. ``It 
seems to make sense,'' said Cone, who has a 1.57 ERA since May in 
starts with five or more days of rest. ``Joe has pushed all the right 
buttons. He's a great manager. If he feels that's the way we should 
go, we all agree.'' Pettitte cringed as he talked about going nine 
days between starts, instead of seven days if he would pitch Game 
2. Still, Pettitte is targeted to pitch a decisive Game 7, a solid 
vote of confidence for a starter who entered the post-season perilously 
after going 3-5 with a 6.14 ERA in August and September. But he pitched 
splendidly in a 3-1 victory over Texas in Game 2 and would be handed 
the baseball if the Yankees faced elimination in a Game 7 in this 
round. ``No question,'' Torre said, ``I'm very confident in that.'' 
So are the Yankees entering the ALCS. The Yankees dominated the dangerous 
Texas offense by limiting the Rangers to one run in three games and 
feel secure that they can handle the Indians if their pitching comes 
even close to being as stingy and the middle of their lineup joins 
Shane Spencer in producing consistently. ``Hopefully, we can start 
hitting the ball and give Shane a little help,'' said Torre, whose 
words brought laughter on a day when the Yankees were relaxed and 
relieved.
