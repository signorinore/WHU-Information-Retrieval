With the celebratory rhythm and blues music blaring and his Cleveland 
Indians teammates rejoicing, Dwight Gooden felt so good Saturday night 
that he forgot about his nightmarish experience three days earlier 
in Game 2 of the division series. His feud with umpire Joe Brinkman 
behind him, Gooden looked forward to returning to New York City, the 
birthplace of his stardom, where the Indians will face the Yankees 
in the American League Championship Series. ``This is great, you couldn't 
have written a better script for me personally,'' said Gooden, moments 
after the Indians finished off the Boston Red Sox, three games to 
one. ``To get the opportunity to go back and pitch in the post-season 
against a team that I played for for two years and in a city that 
I played my whole career in is unbelievable. The main thing for me 
when I take the mound is to keep my emotions down so I can give a 
good performance.'' Gooden may not get to take the mound in Yankee 
Stadium. Indians Manager Mike Hargrove had yet to announce his rotation, 
but Gooden, who started Game 2 against Boston before Brinkman ejected 
him in the first inning for shouting an expletive, is scheduled to 
start Game 3 in Cleveland. Still, the memories, perhaps both good 
and bad, will come in bunches when Gooden walks into the stadium to 
face the team that saw past his history of substance abuse and enabled 
him to return to the major leagues in 1996. ``I'll be ready,'' said 
an obviously excited Gooden, who posted an 8-6 record with a 3.76 
ERA for the Indians. ``I'm waiting to hear the official word on which 
day I have.'' New York has always seen the best and worst of Gooden. 
He pitched the only no-hitter of his career at Yankee Stadium in 1996 
and went 12-4 in the Bronx in 1996 and 1997. Of course, Mets fans 
saw Gooden at his most overpowering, when he went 132-44 from 1984 
to 1991, becoming the youngest player ever to win the Cy Young award 
in 1985 and helping the Mets win the World Series in 1986. But there 
was also the drug and alcohol abuse that turned him into a losing 
pitcher for the Mets from 1992 to 1994, cost him the entire 1995 season 
and threatened to end his career. Now a new man and a clean man, Gooden 
is continuing the successful comeback that he began with the Yankees. 
After beginning this year on the disabled list because of tendinitis 
in his right shoulder and struggling through a couple of tough starts, 
Gooden went 8-4 with a 3.59 ERA from June through the end of the season. 
He said the abbreviated season has left his arm feeling great. ``I 
came back and had a strong second half,'' Gooden said. ``I don't throw 
as hard as I once did on a consistent basis, but I still get up there 
once in a while. Now, I rely more on location and changing speeds.'' 
For all his accomplishments, Gooden has never won a post-season game. 
He has not been terrible, as his ERA of 3.06 attests, but in eight 
starts, he has gone 0-3. While Gooden said he ``couldn't ask for anything 
more'' than a post-season start against the Yankees, he will undoubtedly 
ask for that first victory to come against New York, as well.
