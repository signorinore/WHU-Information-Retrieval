Asked to explain how the Atlanta Braves swept the Chicago Cubs, Sammy 
Sosa was succinct. ``They have a better team and better pitching,'' 
said Sosa, Chicago's star right fielder, after Atlanta ended the Cubs' 
season with a 6-2 victory Saturday night at Wrigley Field. ``When 
you face pitchers like Greg Maddux, John Smoltz and Tom Glavine, they 
are not going to make many mistakes.'' Riding the strength of their 
top three pitchers, and hitting home runs in key situations, the Braves 
have advanced to the National League Championship Series for the seventh 
time this decade. And some believe that this Atlanta team, which won 
a team-record 106 games during the regular season, is the best Braves 
team in club history. They have pitching. They have power. They have 
defense. They have experience. The Braves hope all of those strengths 
are enough to get to the World Series. They open the four-of-seven-game 
championship series on Wednesday night at Turner Field against the 
winner of the Houston-San Diego series, and according to the Braves, 
it does not matter which team they face. When you have as much pitching 
as the Braves do, why worry? ``I believe good pitching beats good 
hitting,'' said Maddux, a four-time Cy Young award winner, who held 
Chicago scoreless through seven innings en route to Saturday night's 
victory. ``If you pitch a good game, you can beat anybody. If you 
pitch a bad game, anybody can beat you.'' The next step figures to 
be harder for the Braves, who have only won one World Series (1995) 
during their incredible run this decade. Last year, the Braves were 
beaten in the NLCS by the Florida Marlins, who went on to win the 
World Series. Yet, the Braves seem deeper and more versatile this 
year. The pitching remains brilliant, with Smoltz, Glavine and Maddux 
all throwing at least seven strong innings against the Cubs in their 
starts. Meanwhile, replacing Fred McGriff at first base with Andres 
Galarraga, who was signed as free agent during the off season, has 
added more pop and another dangerous right-handed hitter to the lineup. 
The Braves set a team record for home runs this year, and that power 
was instrumental in beating the Cubs, as Atlanta homered in every 
game. Ryan Klesko hit a grand slam to break open Game 1 and Eddie 
Lopez hit a grand slam Saturday night to break open Game 3. But perhaps 
the biggest blow of the series came in Game 2, when Javy Lopez hit 
a homer with one out in the ninth inning to tie the game, which Atlanta 
won, 2-1, in the 10th inning. Kevin Tapani was two outs away from 
a complete-game shutout, but when Lopez struck, it deflated the Cubs. 
Sosa, who had a remarkable year with 66 home runs, was contained by 
Atlanta, going 2 for 11 with no home runs and no runs batted in. Mark 
Grace was 1 for 12, and Gary Gaetti was 1 for 11. ``I'm not very happy 
about the way we played the last three games,'' Sosa said. ``I feel 
like if I could give my life to make it to the World Series, I would 
do that. I am getting ready for next year, and we will do better next 
season.'' But for the Braves, this season is still alive. And they 
hope the best times are yet to come.
