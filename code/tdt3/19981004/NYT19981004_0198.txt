Jim Fassel has a problem. In his brief tenure as Giants head coach, 
he has gone through a number of philosophic evolutions before the 
season in an attempt to restore the Giants to their previous glory. 
In the summer he vowed to open the offense up a little more, put more 
faith in his starting quarterback, Danny Kanell, and allow the offense 
to become a bit more intricate. In the wake of a disastrous loss to 
Dallas two weeks ago, Fassel vowed to go back to basics: The Giants 
responded with a lopsided victory in San Diego. In the wake of a demoralizing 
20-3 loss to Tampa Bay Sunday, Fassel is confronted, haunted actually, 
by a looming question that he can't answer: Now what? The Giants' 
offense cannot run, cannot pass consistently. It cannot consistently 
do anything. After the Dallas loss, Fassel admitted that he was baffled. 
Sunday night he sounded beyond baffled; he couldn't explain the sudden 
loss of air from what seemed to be a rising Giants balloon. ``I've 
never been associated with an offense where it's so hard to figure 
out what's best for us to do,'' Fassel said. ``I'm going to do a lot 
of searching and looking and figuring some things out. I'm tired of 
trying to psychoanalyze some guys. I just know one thing: We're the 
New York Giants and we've got to play better on offense, we've got 
to have more production. Any time you're not moving the ball, generally 
speaking, there's not enough guys doing their job. No matter what 
it takes, I'll figure it out.'' Fassel added: ``That's my job, I'll 
take the responsibility. I've got to come up with something that gives 
us the best opportunity to put points on the board. Every time I try 
to get back to basics, get the execution down, give us some opportunities, 
obviously I'm not getting it.'' Sunday's loss has to be deeply troubling 
for Fassel and his staff. Last week, Fassel felt that the Giants had 
finally broken through in the impressive victory over San Diego. ``I 
felt that we had kind of found ourselves a little bit last week,'' 
he said. ``The inconsistencies right now are in what we're doing. 
We can run it, then we can't run. We protect, then we don't protect. 
We throw it complete, then we don't. It's just hard to get in a groove 
that way.'' The Giants are in a rut. A punchless, listless rut. ``The 
offense has to help,'' Fassel said. ``At some point in time you've 
got to block, you've got to run, you've got to hit the right hole.'' 
Last week everyone was all smiles. The victory over San Diego made 
everything seem like it was in working condition in Giants land. The 
runners were running, linemen were blocking and Kanell was stellar. 
Kanell felt the team had finally hit its stride. ``That's why this 
is so discouraging,'' he said. ``You can't afford to fluctuate in 
this league. You have to have some consistency. You have to be able 
to perform week in, week out.'' The Giants finally scored 3 points 
with 13 minutes 20 seconds left. Kanell said he apologized to the 
defense after the game and promised it would never happen again. The 
defense played valiantly, but struggled in the muggy heat and with 
Mike Alstott, the 6-foot-1-inch, 248-pound fullback, plowing into 
the line, the defense finally gave in. The Bucs scored to make it 
20-3 on a 1-yard run by Alstott. What ails the Giants may go beyond 
X's and O's and have something to do with a festering wound. Fassel 
has to decide, once and for all, what to do with Tyrone Wheatley, 
the veteran running back. The coach apparently doesn't care for Wheatley. 
At the same time, Fassel can't afford to be without him because the 
offense has no weight. One of the ridiculous scenes of the game: the 
Giants' futile running game going nowhere and Wheatley standing on 
the sideline in civilian clothes _ also going nowhere. Play Wheatley: 
if he doesn't cut it, relegate him to the bench for eternity. Player 
and coach don't have to go to lunch with each other; the fact of the 
matter is that the Giants' offense is being routinely handed its lunch. 
As for Kanell, the 25-year-old in his first full year as a starter, 
he is continuing to discover how difficult it is just to be consistently 
ordinary in the National Football League: One week he's neutralized 
by Dallas, the next week he's a star in San Diego, the next week he's 
a goat in Tampa. On the third play Sunday, Kanell threw an interception 
that Charles Mincy returned for a 22-yard touchdown. ``That's life 
as a QB in the NFL,'' Kanell said. ``You try to bounce back. I'll 
be back firing next week.'' Coming off the bench to save the day is 
one thing; making the day from start to finish is quite another matter.
