One week after they were ordered back into Nassau Coliseum by a judge, 
the New York Islanders played there for the first time since last 
season. But there was neither confetti nor streamers welcoming them 
home. Even the four Stanley Cup championship banners were missing. 
Instead, a small crowd of angry fans booed, wore hard hats and held 
up signs expressing frustration or disappointment with the team's 
ownership, which last month tried to move the teams' home games and 
had not signed their two best players, Zigmund Palffy and Trevor Linden. 
Even at $10 a seat _ season ticket-holders were admitted free _ there 
were fewer than 3,000 spectators at Sunday night's preseason game 
against the Capitals, who won, 5-3. Many fans have been alienated 
by the Islanders' new owners, Steven Gluckstern and Howard Milstein, 
who said last month that the Coliseum scoreboard was in danger of 
falling from the ceiling. The team filed a $10 million lawsuit against 
SMG, the company that manages the Coliseum, and moved out of the building. 
Engineers hired by the National Hockey League and Nassau County later 
rebuffed the Islanders' argument and a bid to get out of the lease. 
which is good through 2015 and does not give the team any revenue 
from parking, concessions or advertising. ``It's upsetting,'' said 
Dave Burrus of Yonkers, who bought season tickets for the first time 
earlier this year. ``I don't think the owners are as devoted as they 
said they were. It seems to me that they are willing to throw the 
whole season away over a bad lease.'' Pete Minichiello of White Plains, 
who has been a season ticket-holder the past four years, was equally 
upset. ``The new owners have promised so much, but they haven't done 
anything. They don't care.'' The fans' anger seemed to be directed 
more at the Islanders' organization than Nassau County or SMG, the 
company that maintains the 26-year-old facility. A girl wearing a 
hockey sweater autographed by every member of the Islanders held up 
a sign with the message ``Stop wrecking our team.'' The Islanders 
were trailing the Capitals, 2-1, midway through the second period 
when fans began to chant: ``We want Ziggy. We want Ziggy.'' But to 
have him in the lineup Saturday in the season opener against Pittsburgh, 
the Islanders will have to pay $6.8 million per season to the 26-year-old 
right wing, who scored 87 points last season. The Islanders have not 
reached the postseason in four years, and without Palffy or Linden 
they will surely struggle to get there this season. The team is likely 
to struggle at the gate as well. ``I don't really know and I don't 
really care,'' said Mike Milbury, the Islanders' coach and general 
manager, when asked to predict the size of the crowd for Sunday night's 
game.``I'm not concerned about it.'' The line of questioning caused 
Milbury to lose his patience. ``Ask me some hockey questions,'' he 
said. Another member of the organization did answer. ``We expected 
this size crowd,'' said David Seldin, Islanders president.``I can 
understand why the fans feel angry and frustrated. It's been a tough 
road for our fans and we haven't done right by them.''
