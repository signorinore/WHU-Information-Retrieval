EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. _ That smile on Robert Smith's face? It's a grin 
of peace. Not contentment, but happiness knowing that maybe _ just 
maybe _ the most explosive running back you've hardly heard of has 
put his injury-riddled past behind him. The closest Smith has come 
to a doctor recently was a visit to a guy with Novocain in his hand. 
One morning last week, Smith took off his Minnesota Vikings uniform, 
donned a bib and was told to open wide. Three-quarters of a front 
tooth had been sheared off and two other teeth were badly chipped. 
They had been shattered last Sunday in Chicago after one of those 
high-stepping, jaw-dropping Smith runs _ the ones he used to make 
between visits to the injured reserve list. This time it was a 67-yard 
play on which Smith caught a short pass and made like a speeding bullet. 
And when Smith does that, he looks like a cross between Jim Brown 
and O.J. Simpson. That's no exaggeration. In the end zone, Smith was 
greeted by Vikings guard David Dixon, who, at 352 pounds, is built 
like a World Trade Center. Dixon opened his arms, blocking out the 
sun, and bearhugged Smith so hard that he pushed the running back's 
face mask into his teeth. ``If that's the only way I get hurt all 
season,'' Smith said, ``that's fine with me.'' He can laugh now, but 
Smith's career has been one of the most injury filled, yet fascinating, 
of any running back's in the 1990s. Now, healthy for the first time 
in years _ knock on wood _ Smith has established himself as an elite 
back, in the same class as Barry Sanders, Terrell Davis and Curtis 
Martin. ``I definitely see myself in that group,'' Smith said. ``But 
I'll leave that stuff up to everybody else. It doesn't do any good 
if I consider myself in that group and I don't help this team win 
ball games.'' When the Vikings and Green Bay Packers play on Monday 
night at Lambeau Field in a battle of 4-0 teams, it is Smith the Packers 
will see as the biggest threat. As much as the Vikings' offense is 
about their wide receivers _ Cris Carter, Jake Reed and the explosive 
rookie Randy Moss _ Smith is the true key to whether Minnesota can 
beat Green Bay and make a legitimate Super Bowl run. That is why it 
is so important that Smith stay healthy. A first-round draft pick 
in 1993 after his sophomore year at Ohio State, his rookie season 
in the National Football League was a disaster because of two days 
in a hospital with chicken pox, an inner-ear infection and, after 
10 games, a season-ending knee injury. A hip injury kept him out of 
several games in 1994; in 1995, it was a broken ankle. Torn knee ligaments 
in 1996 sent him to the injured reserve. He played in nine games in 
1995, eight in 1996. Then came 1997. It was one of the quietest career 
years a running back has ever had. Despite missing another two and 
a half games because of an injured ankle, Smith set team records for 
rushing yards in a season (1,266), 100-yard games in a season (6), 
season rushing average (5.5) and consecutive carries without a fumble 
(352). He also had two of the three longest runs in Vikings history, 
blazing for 78 yards against Buffalo and 76 against Indianapolis. 
The Vikings, thinking Smith was their ticket to a Super Bowl, signed 
him to a five-year, $25 million contract in the off season. Now, his 
wallet fat and his high-step back, Smith feels better than he ever 
has. Coming into this weekend's games, Smith was third in the NFL 
in rushing, with 384 yards on 75 carries and 2 touchdowns. ``I feel 
great,'' Smith said. ``I'm healthy, everything is good. I'm not going 
to say I'll never get hurt again. That would be stupidity. But I feel 
as good as I ever have in my career.'' Smith's coaches like what they 
have seen this year. ``Robert is a strong competitor,'' said the Vikings' 
running backs coach, Carl Hargrave. ``Not only does he put pressure 
on the people around him, he also puts it on himself.'' Another thing 
that sets Smith apart, besides almost shocking speed developed as 
a champion collegiate sprinter, is that he is one of the most opinionated 
players in the NFL In a sport that emphasizes the collective over 
the individual, Smith has managed to keep his distinctiveness. He 
has never met a question he didn't like. Smith on religion in the 
locker room: ``There are too many players who are Christians who think 
because they're Christians, they're better than other players. It's 
just like any other aspect of society, when you have a majority group, 
and Christianity is the majority in this country, that group has a 
tendency to think their way is the right way. There is freedom of 
religion in this country, and people shouldn't push Christianity on 
people who don't want to be Christians.'' Smith on his teammate Moss, 
whose stock fell dramatically on draft day because of off-field problems: 
``We got the steal of the draft. When are teams going to realize you 
can only hold a guy so responsible for things he did when he was 19 
or 20 years old? We've all done things we're not proud of, that we 
wish we could take back. ``Part of the problem is that many of the 
neighborhoods black players grow up in, a lot of us get in trouble. 
That's no excuse. That's just the environment we grew up in. It's 
darn near impossible to avoid all the trouble. I mean, I was arrested 
a couple of times before I even got to high school.'' Smith on Vikings 
Coach Dennis Green, and why many Vikings players think he has been 
treated unfairly by some fans and members of the news media: ``Well, 
we're in Minnesota. The people here like to think of themselves as 
liberal, but it's a pretty conservative state. It's a predominantly 
white state. He's not a PR guy, he just cares about getting the job 
done. And he's black. That plays a big factor in some people's minds.'' 
As for his own image, Smith knows there can be no long trips to the 
trainer's room this season or it will be hard to erase that tag of 
a player who can't stay healthy. ``I feel good about this season,'' 
Smith said. ``Both personally and for our team.'' His optimism is 
understandable. He's healthy, the Vikings are winning, and he's a 
big reason why.
