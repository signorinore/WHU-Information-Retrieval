It was considered quite a show at the time: a brazen British bombing 
raid in 1943 on a trio of strategic German dams carried out with such 
high-spirited elan, employing such delightfully preposterous techniques 
and producing such spectacular success that it gave an immediate boost 
to battered British morale in World War II. One of the last surviving 
pilots, Joseph C. McCarthy, an American at the time of the raid, died 
of emphysema at his home in Virginia Beach, Va., on Sept. 6 at age 
79. The dam-busting raid of May 16 made instant heroes of the 11 pilots 
who survived the mission, which claimed eight of the raid's 19 Lancaster 
bombers and 53 of their 133 crewmen. Their remarkable bouncing bombs 
wreaked watery havoc on the industrial Ruhr valley, breaching two 
of the dams and sending almost half a billion tons of water cascading 
down river channels in walls 50 feet high, smashing bridges, factories 
and power plants for 100 miles. Some have argued that it was the turning 
point of the war, but even if it was not, the raid is recalled so 
fondly even today that it sends chills down British spines every time 
the 1955 film ``The Dam Busters'' is shown on television. For all 
the British pride in their beloved dam busters, if it can be said 
that the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton, 
it would not be much more of an exaggeration to suggest that the attack 
on the Ruhr dams was wrought in part on the flying fields of New York 
City, for that is where McCarthy learned to fly. As the lone American 
in 617 Squadron, the secret and now storied unit formed and trained 
expressly to carry out the low-flying raid, McCarthy was the Bronx-bred 
man whom the British knew as Big Joe. McCarthy was a native of St. 
James, Long Island, who grew up in the Bronx, where a grandfather 
had been a deputy sheriff and his father was a New York City fireman. 
He worked as a lifeguard at Coney Island and learned to fly as a teen-ager. 
He got into the fray because he had been so eager to see aerial action 
against the Germans that he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force months 
before the United States entered the war in December 1941. At a time 
when the average life expectancy of a bomber pilot was 16 missions, 
McCarthy, like the other crack pilots recruited for the Ruhr raid, 
had established his flying expertise by completing 30 bombing runs 
over Germany. After the raid he completed 40 more. He had also become 
a favorite of his fellow pilots. A 6-foot-3-inch, 225-pound man known 
as the big blond American, McCarthy had a personality as outsized 
as his physique and an outspoken penchant for unrestrained American 
profanity that trumped the more timid oaths of his compatriots. In 
the end McCarthy lost the cultural clash. By the time the war was 
over he had gone British, affecting a pipe, a walking stick and a 
dog on a leash. ``If I'm going to be an officer and a gentleman,'' 
he said, ``I'm going to have a crack at looking the part.'' The transformation 
was so complete that to remain in the RCAF he became a Canadian citizen 
after the war, serving in a variety of military posts. They included 
an international assignment in Norfolk, Va., which led him to retire 
in 1969 to nearby Virginia Beach. Few people there knew that he had 
been personally congratulated by King George VI and invested with 
the prestigious Distinguished Service Order for his role in what the 
British still recall as one of the most spectacular bombing raids 
in aviation history. If it does not seem surprising that the same 
British military establishment that invented snooker should embrace 
the outlandish idea of skipping bombs across the water to destroy 
a dam, it was not whimsy but military expedience that produced the 
audacious scheme. The dams holding back three rivers _ the Eder, the 
Moehne and the Sorpe _ emptying into the Ruhr, a Rhine tributary, 
were obvious enough military targets, because destroying them could 
do serious harm to the arms factories in Germany's industrial heartland. 
The problem was how to do it. At a time when bombs sometimes missed 
their targets by as much as five miles, it was considered futile to 
try to make a direct hit on top of a dam, especially with a bomb big 
enough to cause a serious breach. Since a dam's most vulnerable spot 
was at its base, beneath the waterline, torpedoes would have been 
an alternative, but the landlocked lakes were inaccessible to submarines. 
Yet the Germans had not taken the precaution of using a series of 
surface booms and underwater nets to protect the dams against torpedoes 
dropped from the air. British military planners had written off any 
notion of attacking the dams until a brilliant, eccentric scientist 
named Barnes Wallis came up with the idea of bouncing rapidly backspinning 
cylinder bombs across the water until they hit the dam and crawled 
down its concrete face, where a hydrostatic trigger would set them 
off at the right depth. The idea eventually won the approval of the 
British high command, who, after all, would not be the ones charged 
with flying through a wall of flak to deliver 10,000-pound bombs at 
a precise distance from a dam while flying at a precise, slow speed 
at an altitude of exactly 60 feet. This was clearly a job for the 
colonials. Indeed, while the dog-fighting Battle of Britain had attracted 
a corps of swashbuckling British aristocrats, there were few among 
the British bomber pilots. Their ranks were filled from the Commonwealth 
countries of Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and especially Canada. 
By the time of the actual mission, the 617 Squadron had already laid 
the groundwork for the legend that would be reflected in the 1955 
movie starring Michael Redgrave as Wallis and Richard Todd as Wing 
Commander Guy Gibson. In 1993 McCarthy, as one of the three surviving 
dam-busting pilots, attended 50th-anniversary celebrations in England. 
With the passage of time what had once seemed a jolly good show has 
lost some of its original luster, in part because the Germans quickly 
repaired the extensive damage and in part because more attention has 
been paid to the raid's human toll. More than 1,400 people drowned, 
among them some 750 slave laborers from half a dozen countries, including 
a contingent of Ukrainian women trapped in a padlocked compound. McCarthy's 
bomb caused negligible damage, except to the dam. Although he delivered 
his bomb perfectly and it detonated as planned, his target was an 
earthen dam that absorbed much of its impact. McCarthy is survived 
by his wife, Alice; two children, Joseph B. McCarthy and Karen Westergaard, 
both of Virginia Beach; a brother, Frank, of Glendale, and five grandchildren.
