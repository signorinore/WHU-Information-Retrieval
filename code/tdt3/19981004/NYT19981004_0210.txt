Philip Grushkin, a book designer whose work made him the standard-bearer 
throughout the publishing industry, died on Sept. 25 at Hackensack 
University Medical Center in Hackensack, N.J. He was 77 and lived 
in Englewood, N.J. The cause was heart failure, his daughter, Dena 
Florczyk, said. Over five decades, Grushkin designed hundreds of books 
for publishers including Alfred A. Knopf, Random House, Abbeville 
and Harry N. Abrams, where he worked as art director during the 1960s 
when the company came to prominence as a leading art book publisher. 
He then formed his own company, Philip Grushkin Inc., working in a 
third-floor studio and darkroom in his home, surrounded by airbrush 
equipment, gadgets, pens, rules and thousands of pieces of paper assembled 
in piles. His life was literally books, said his son, Paul, noting 
that some 10,000 volumes lined the walls of the Grushkins' home. Yet, 
he was an invisible presence, his work evident only to a book's author, 
the publisher's editorial and design staff, the printer and the bindery. 
Among the books considered exemplary examples of his art are ``History 
of Art,'' by H.W. Janson; ``A History of Far Eastern Art,'' by Sherman 
E. Lee, and ``Atlas of Human Anatomy,'' by Frank H. Netter. Growing 
up in Brooklyn, Grushkin discovered art at an early age. He studied 
at Cooper Union in Manhattan and then became the star pupil of the 
master book designer George Salter. Like Salter, Grushkin taught his 
art to others, first at Cooper Union, then at New York University, 
the University of Virginia and Radcliffe College. Hand-lettering was 
his mantra and muse. A computer, he argued, obliterated all that felt 
alive. But in the mid-1990s, Grushkin discovered that no publisher 
would accept a finished book design except on a computer disk. In 
six months he taught himself how to design full books on a computer. 
In addition to his daughter, Dena, of Teaneck, N.J., and his son Paul 
of Pinole, Calif., he is survived by his wife, Jean; another son, 
Jonas of Durango, Colo., two brothers, Stanley of Virginia Beach, 
Va., and Daniel of Miami, and six grandchildren.
