Haru Matsukata Reischauer, a journalist and author who was influential 
in diplomatic affairs in the 1960s as the wife of the U.S. ambassador 
to Japan, died on Sept. 23 in La Jolla, Calif. She was 83. The cause 
of death was heart failure, a former colleague said. Mrs. Reischauer's 
deep understanding of both Japanese and American cultures and mores 
made her highly qualified to ease tensions between the two countries 
in the early '60s. As the embassy's first lady, she was crucial, her 
former colleagues said, in bringing a psychological end to the postwar 
occupation of Japan. She grew up in Tokyo; her father was a prominent 
Japanese statesman and her mother was an American of Japanese descent. 
As a child, she had an American tutor, and she graduated from Principia 
College in Illinois. Late in life, she traced the roots of her family's 
tradition of statesmanship and their appreciation of the United States. 
In ``Samurai and Silk: A Japanese and American Heritage'' (Harvard 
University Press, 1986) she told the story of her two grandfathers: 
One, born to a peasant family, became a wealthy silk merchant in New 
York; the other, from a samurai family, rose to be prime minister 
twice and was also a powerful finance minister responsible for overhauling 
Japan's financial system in the 19th century. Not until the end of 
World War II _ which she spent in Japan, feeling ``totally out of 
place,'' said a colleague from her embassy days _ did her bicultural 
background become useful. ``Suddenly, everything opened up,'' said 
George Packard, who is now president of the U.S.-Japan Foundation 
in New York. During the 1950s, she wrote regularly about Japan for 
The Saturday Evening Post and The Christian Science Monitor. But it 
was through her husband that she became an major influence in establishing 
friendly relations between the United States and Japan. James Michener 
introduced her to Edwin Reischauer, a widower with three children 
and a Harvard professor of Japanese studies. As teen-agers, it turned 
out, they had gone to the same Tokyo high school, where she had had 
a secret crush on him. Robert Immerman, a senior research associate 
at Columbia University's East Asian Institute, who also worked at 
the U.S. Embassy when she was there, said that before her marriage 
in 1956, ``she was never at home in either culture.'' Afterward, he 
said, she moved easily in both. ``Somehow that relationship fulfilled 
her.'' In 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed Edwin Reischauer 
ambassador to Japan. ``Relations seemed to be coming apart,'' Packard 
said. The Japanese government was under pressure at the time from 
groups on the left that wanted to end the security arrangement with 
the United States. In those tense times, Mrs. Reischauer could easily 
have found herself distrusted by both the Americans and the Japanese. 
Instead, said Packard _ who was then a special assistant to the ambassador 
_ she became widely respected. She came to be considered Japan's most 
popular woman, after the empress. She went out of her way to be considerate 
with embassy employees, said Immerman, a junior embassy officer at 
the time. For instance, she opened the swimming pool, long reserved 
for the ambassador's family, to everyone. She brought in influential 
Japanese people ignored by earlier administrations _ intellectuals, 
writers and leaders of citizens' groups. She and her husband were 
a team. Before making decisions, Reischauer would consult with his 
wife, Immerman recalled. ``She had a major role in helping him shape 
U.S. policy,'' he said. In 1966, at the conclusion of his appointment, 
the Reischauers returned to Cambridge, Mass., and to Harvard. Later, 
they moved to California. Edwin Reischauer died in 1990. One stepson, 
Robert, of Bethesda, Md., following the family tradition of public 
service, became director of the Congressional Budget Office and is 
now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Mrs. Reischauer 
is also survived by two stepdaughters, Ann Heinemann of La Jolla and 
Joan Simon of Larchmont, N.Y.; two sisters, Naka Rawthroen of Los 
Angeles and Mari Bruck of Studio City, Calif.; nine grandchildren, 
and three great-grandchildren. Packard described her role in bringing 
together the United States and Japan. ``She, herself, was a bridge,'' 
he said. ``She represented an America that was friendly and respectful 
to Japan.''
