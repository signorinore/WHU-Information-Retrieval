In what could result in the largest building program in New Jersey's 
history, the Whitman administration is proposing to spend $5.3 billion 
to build or repair hundreds of schools in New Jersey over the next 
10 years. The move comes in response to a ruling in May by the New 
Jersey Supreme Court that requires the administration to replace or 
refurbish deteriorating buildings and classrooms in the 28 poorest 
school districts in the state. Under the plan, roughly $2.6 billion 
would be spent for construction in those districts, which include 
large cities like Newark and Trenton, as well as East Orange, Asbury 
Park, and other smaller urban areas. An additional $2.7 billion would 
be reserved for schools in more prosperous communities across the 
state. The administration is also proposing to centralize the financing 
and management of school construction projects under a single state 
agency to cut costs. The New Jersey Building Authority, which was 
created 17 years ago to erect state buildings, would oversee the financing, 
design and construction of new schools in the 28 poorest school districts, 
all in urban areas, where the state is required to pay all costs, 
and in suburban districts, which would have to pay for their own projects 
but could save money by using the Building Authority. Pete McDonough, 
a spokesman for Gov. Christie Whitman, said centralized financing 
and construction management could produce savings of up to 25 percent 
through increased efficiency, experience and greater buying power. 
For example, McDonough said, the Building Authority would assemble 
prequalified lists of design and construction firms for school projects. 
``Because they would know that for the next X number of years they'll 
be building a set number of buildings, their price will come down 
tremendously,'' he said. The centralized approach, which would have 
to be approved by the Legislature, could also eliminate a healthy 
source of patronage. Currently, local school officials are able to 
hand out contracts to favored builders, architects, lawyers and underwriters. 
It is unclear, however, whether the spending outlined in the plan, 
first reported in The Sunday Star-Ledger of Newark, will be enough 
to satisfy the Supreme Court. A report prepared for the court in January 
recommended spending up to $2.8 billion to repair or replace deteriorating 
buildings in schools in the poorer districts, which educate 300,000 
children, or about a fourth of the students enrolled in New Jersey 
public schools. David Sciarra, executive director of the Education 
Law Center, said that it was too early to put a price tag on the necessary 
work. In January, he said, the urban school districts are to complete 
court-ordered assessments of their existing buildings and future needs. 
``There's no way to know until then whether $2.6 billion, or $2.8 
billion, or whatever amount will be sufficient to meet the court's 
order,'' he said.
