The 13-year-old, sumptuously extravagant Franco Zeffirelli production 
of Puccini's ``Tosca'' at the Metropolitan Opera is hugely popular 
with audiences. So the company, naturally, keeps bringing it back. 
But sometimes the casting seems an afterthought, with singers fitted 
into the schedule like interchangeable parts. Of course, a major reason 
for the return of ``Tosca'' this season is Luciano Pavarotti, who 
is to sing three performances as Mario in November to observe his 
30th anniversary with the company. But starting with the season's 
first ``Tosca,'' which came on Friday night, there will be 14 performances, 
the last on March 25, offering a total of three Marios, three Scarpias 
and five Toscas. Forging some consistency of concept on the rotating 
roster of singers will be the task of the veteran Italian maestro 
Nello Santi, who is conducting all the performances. On Friday, the 
Czech soprano Eva Urbanova appeared in place of the originally announced 
Tosca, Daniela Dessi, who withdrew two weeks ago because of an injury. 
Ms. Urbanova is a genuine artist and an admirable singer. Her sizable 
voice throbs with rich vibrato. Her tone is dusky and earthy, rather 
than conventionally beautiful. However, on Friday her high notes were 
strained, a bit raw and sharp in pitch. And there was more intensity 
and expressivity in her singing than in her acting, which was seldom 
compelling. The tenor Richard Leech made an energetic, athletic Mario, 
easily able to bound up the stairs of the scaffolding to work on his 
mural of Mary Magdalene in Act I, an aspect of the staging that Pavarotti 
forgoes these days. Vocally, Leech started out shakily, singing with 
dry tone and tremulous sound. But he warmed up and summoned some ringing, 
house-filling top notes. However, he may be paying a price for his 
increased emphasis on power: some of his legato singing lacked elegance 
and pliancy. The French baritone Alain Fondary had a poor night as 
the villainous police chief, Baron Scarpia. His singing was huffy 
and short of breath, and he created little sense of malevolence. Santi, 
who is steeped in the Italian tradition, had bold ideas about the 
pacing and shape of this rhapsodic score. The orchestra was essentially 
in sync with his conception, but the cast less so: there were noticeable 
glitches in entrances and timing. One is tempted to predict that the 
ensemble problems will easily be corrected in future performances. 
But the cast rotation begins on Wednesday night, when the soprano 
Aprile Millo arrives to sing the first of three scheduled performances 
as Tosca.
