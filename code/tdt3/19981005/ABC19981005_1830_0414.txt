In Washington today, President Clinton met with officials from nearly 
two dozen countries about how to contain the damage of the global 
economic crisis. The worry now is that the international monetary 
fund and the world bank still do not have a plan for dealing with 
it. The IMF is working on another multibillion dollar bailout for 
what everyone agrees is the next big trouble spot. Brazil is in trouble, 
and all of a sudden the global economic crisis seems very close to 
home. It's not far away in east Asia, not in Russia, it is right here 
on our doorstep. Brazil is the world's ninth largest economy. And 
now, just a few years after taming 5000% inflation, Brazil stands 
on the brink. Its stock market has dropped 50% this year. Unemployment 
has doubled. Wary investors have taken $30 billion out of the country 
in the last two months alone. You can understand why Americans are 
nervous. More than 2,000 American companies operate there. American 
banks have made $27 billion worth of loan there. $16 billion worth 
of American goods are sold there. But first and foremost, Brazil is 
the economic anchor for Latin America, and investors fear if Brazil's 
economy collapses it will take Argentina and the rest of the region 
down with it, a region that accounts for one-fifth of the trade the 
U.S. does with the world. There's no question in my mind that people 
today in the markets around the world, people see Brazil as the last 
bastion, and therefore, we're almost tied into having to do something 
about it. Brazil just wrapped up a presidential election paving the 
way for IMF officials to announce a bailout package for Brazil of 
up to $30 billion. Nervous investors await the details. Betsy Stark, 
ABC News, New York.
