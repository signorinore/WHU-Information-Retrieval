The U.N. secretary-general has issued his report on Serbian aggression 
in Kosovo today. There have been "appalling atrocities," the majority 
carried out by Serb security forces, in a campaign of "terror and 
violence against civilians." The Serbs are trying to avoid NATO air 
strikes, insisting that their forces have left Kosovo. On the ground, 
it's not that clear. ABC's Mike Lee is there. Although the Serb military 
has pulled large numbers of tanks and troops out of Kosovo, western 
officials told ABC News today, the Serbs are maintaining a significant 
and credible presence inside Kosovo. The Serbs have also continued 
shelling some villages. The American who may know the Serbs best went 
to Belgrade today to increase the pressure. Richard Holbrooke delivered 
another ultimatum to the Serb leader, Slobodan Milosevic. Make peace 
with the Albanians, or face war with NATO. The Albanians certainly 
do not not believe the Serbs have pulled back for good. They heard 
the promises of peace before. They are unlikely to go rushing back 
to their villages just because of another political agreement. In 
one ail bannian village today a survivor of one of last week's massacres, 
a 6-week-old girl named detoria, found beneath the body of her slain 
mother, she'll be raised by other villagers. Mike Lee, ABC News, Kosovo. 
late today the state department Milosevic and ambassador Holbrooke, 
there was no progress.
