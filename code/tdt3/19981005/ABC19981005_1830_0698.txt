At the United Nations today, the government of China has finally signed 
an important human rights treaty calling for freedom of expression 
and religion. It will only be effective when the Chinese legislature 
approves it. Just hours before the treaty was signed, police in Beijing 
detained a prominent dissident who was trying to legally Register 
a human rights monitoring group.
