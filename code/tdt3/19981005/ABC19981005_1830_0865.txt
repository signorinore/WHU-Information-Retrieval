In Kentucky today, the teenage suspect in one of the worst school 
shootings last year pleaded guilty. But mentally ill. Michael Carneal 
opened fire on a prayer group at school in west Paducah, Kentucky, 
last September. Three students were killed. Carneal faces life in 
prison with no parole for at least 25 years. A bit confusing but it 
means 25 years without parole.
