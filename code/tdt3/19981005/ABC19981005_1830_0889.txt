It has been six months now since voters in California fought a fierce 
battle over proposition 227. Requires English in the classroom, an 
ened to bilingual education even for students who speak only Spanish. 
However, now one month into the new school year, many students are 
once again learning in Spanish, despite proposition 227. ABC's Jane 
Clayson is in -- tonight. Monica Martinez says it is a relief to be 
speaking to her first graders in Spanish again. Uno, dos, tres. It 
has been frustrating trying to teach even simple math to them in English. 
Their faces were blank, maybe. In the morning, by the end of the day, 
it was tears. And I felt hopeless. This year, all of California's 
Spanish-speaking students are spending the first 30 days of school 
learning primarily in English. Under the new law, they can return 
to bilingual classes only if their parents request a waiver. At park 
avenue elementary, 8% of parents did. I'm really working hard to make 
up for that month. They lost a lot. They could have been writing and 
reading much more than they are now. Veronica alvarez requested a 
waiver. She says her daughter learns better in Spanish, and it's easier 
helping with homework. But backers of prop 227 worry that too many 
waivers will result in a return to bilingual education. They insist 
some schools are sabotaging the will of the voters and, in effect, 
getting around the law. We know that there has been a tremendous amount 
of pressure on the parents of individual schools to apply for waivers. 
Sometimes, the schools are even filling out the application for them. 
Administrators deny that. But some school districts are requesting 
blanket waivers to bring bilingual education back to class. It is 
too early to know exactly how many classrooms are returning to bilingual 
education. But it is clear, a law passed by the majority of California 
voters to end that program is difficult for thousands of parents and 
educators to give up. Jane Clayson, ABC News, Los Angeles.
