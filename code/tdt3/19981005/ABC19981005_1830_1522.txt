There is more information on threats to your privacy and what you 
might do to protect yourself on our web site. And tomorrow we'll look 
more closely at privacy online, how the Internet has actually made 
things even worse. Back a final thought for this evening in just a 
moment. bercon or metamucil? Both have fiber for regularity. But I 
like Fibercon better. Same natural action of fiber, but only Fibercon 
contains calcium. And with Fibercon, I get my fiber in two caplets. 
With days I hotels in over 1,800 cities and towns U never think about 
where to stay. You just go with the flow.
