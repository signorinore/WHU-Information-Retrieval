Finally this evening, the most original excuse we heard today -- in 
California, "the San Jose Mercury news" launched an investigation 
into why the Santa Clara county courthouse was always virtually empty 
on Friday afternoons, even though the county has a serious backlog 
of cases. It turns out some of the most important county judges have 
been using Friday afternoons to run errands and play golf. I think 
the electoral is better served said one judge, knowing I'm getting 
exercise for my emotional and physical stability. Wish we thought 
of that one.
