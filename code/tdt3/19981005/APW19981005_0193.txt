Iraq will not resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors unless 
the Security Council removes punishing trade sanctions, a senior Iraqi 
official said Monday. Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said that 
Iraq's decision of Aug. 5 to suspend cooperation with the inspectors 
``is a decision which cannot be reversed.'' ``Iraq cannot go on bearing 
the injustice it has been subjected to,'' Ramadan said. ``The status 
quo is totally unacceptable to Iraq.'' He made the remarks in an address 
he delivered on behalf of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein at the opening 
of a three-day conference for Iraqis who live abroad. The conference 
for expatriates drew about 1,000 people. His comments came as U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan was scheduled to report to the Security 
Council on Monday on meetings he held in New York last week with Iraq's 
deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz. Annan has spoken of a ``comprehensive 
review'' of Iraq's disarmament efforts _ a step that could lead to 
the lifting of trade sanctions _ but only if Iraq agrees to resume 
cooperation with U.N. inspectors. The sanctions, which limit Iraq's 
sale of oil and ban air travel and other financial dealings, were 
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The Security Council 
has said they will not be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that 
Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq insists 
it has done so, but U.N. inspectors say Baghdad still is hiding information 
on chemical and biological weapons. On Aug. 5, Saddam announced that 
the country would not longer cooperate with the inspectors, charging 
that they were working to prolong the punishing sanctions. In his 
speech, Ramadan said that Iraq would only allow the inspectors to 
resume work after the Security Council acts ``to close weapons files 
and to implement Paragraph 22'' of U.N. Security Council Resolution 
687, which calls for lifting the sanctions. Ramadan also said Iraq 
wants the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees inspections, to 
be restructured. In the past, Iraq said the inspectors were U.S. and 
British spies. In his speech, Ramadan referred to recent disclosures 
that UNSCOM had contacts with Western intelligence agencies and insisted 
that it be freed of influence by U.S. and Israeli spy agencies. Ramadan 
repeated Iraq's allegation that the United States was campaigning 
to keep the sanctions in place to try to topple Saddam. He accused 
Washington of ``blatant hostility against the Iraqi people'' and added: 
``America is pursuing all means to topple the regime in Iraq.''
