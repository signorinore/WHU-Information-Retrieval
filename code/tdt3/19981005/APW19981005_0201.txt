Iraq will not resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors unless 
the U.N. Security Council removes punishing trade sanctions, a senior 
Iraqi official said Monday. Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said 
that Iraq's decision of Aug. 5 to suspend cooperation with the inspectors 
``is a decision which cannot be reversed.'' ``Iraq cannot go on bearing 
the injustice it has been subjected to,'' Ramadan said. ``The status 
quo is totally unacceptable to Iraq.'' He made the remarks in an address 
he delivered on behalf of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein at the opening 
of a three-day conference for Iraqis who live abroad. The conference 
for expatriates drew about 1,000 people. His comments came as U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan was scheduled to report to the Security 
Council Monday on meetings he held in New York last week with Iraq's 
deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz. Annan has spoken of a ``comprehensive 
review'' of Iraq's disarmament efforts _ a step that could lead to 
the lifting of trade sanctions _ but only if Iraq agrees to resume 
cooperation with U.N. inspectors. The sanctions, which limit Iraq's 
sale of oil and ban air travel and other financial dealings, were 
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The Security Council 
has said they will not be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that 
Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq insists 
it has done so, but U.N. inspectors say Baghdad still is hiding information 
on chemical and biological weapons.
