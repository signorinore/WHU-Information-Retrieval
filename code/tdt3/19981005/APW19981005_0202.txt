The governing and opposition parties of Lesotho opened negotiations 
Monday at loggerheads over who will govern the country until early 
elections in 15 to 18 months. The talks, brokered by representatives 
of the Southern African Development Community, followed last month's 
military intervention by South Africa troops to quell unrest and restore 
the government's authority. The intervention, under the auspices of 
the SADC, led to massive destruction of the capital and the deaths 
of scores of people in the mountain kingdom of 2 million people. The 
Lesotho Democratic Congress party, which swept last May's elections, 
says it will not form a government of national unity until the next 
balloting, South African Press Association reported. The opposition 
parties are demanding a role in the interim administration. They accuse 
the government of stealing the last election. The parties reported 
progress on Friday, when they tentatively agreed to the new elections.
