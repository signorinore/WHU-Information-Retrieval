Japan should move quickly to clean up bad bank debts, ease government 
regulations and boost the economy with fiscal stimulus measures, a 
European Union official said Monday. Ambassador Ove Juul Joergensen, 
who heads the European Commission in Japan, said the widening global 
financial crisis requires prompt and effective action from Tokyo. 
``What we need now is swift, decisive action to put forward these 
policies and implement them,'' he said. Joergensen, briefing reporters 
ahead of the EU-Japan ministerial meeting next Monday in Tokyo, said 
the meeting will focus on issues of trade and international stability. 
Other issues to be discussed include deregulation and international 
crime. ``Japan and the European Union must cooperate on the structure 
of the international financial architecture to make sure it meets 
the needs of the 21st century,'' he said. The European delegation 
will be lead by EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan, who will meet 
with Japanese politicians and businessmen in addition to his talks 
with the government. Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura will head the 
Japanese side of the talks. Brittan will be accompanied on his trip 
by about 20 executives from European companies to discuss business 
opportunities in Japan, Joergensen said.
