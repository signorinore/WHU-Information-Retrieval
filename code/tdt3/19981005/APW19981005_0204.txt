A Sudanese warplane bombed two towns in northwestern Uganda, wounding 
six people, Ugandan and aid officials said Monday. The target appeared 
to be Sudanese refugees, said Nino Tomoko, spokeswoman for the U.N. 
refugee agency. About 158,756 refugees from Sudan's 15-year civil 
war are in more than two dozen settlements in the area. An Antonov 
dropped six bombs on Pakele and four on Adjumani on Saturday evening, 
wounding four women and two children, and destroying two huts, said 
Steven Kavuma, state minister for defense. ``The government of Uganda 
condemns this act of aggression,'' Kavuma said of the attacks on the 
towns 350 kilometers (220 miles) northwest of Kampala. In Khartoum, 
the government denied Sudan had bombed Uganda. ``This is not true, 
and they have to provide the evidence,'' said Hassan Abdin, permanent 
secretary in the Sudanese Foreign Ministry.
