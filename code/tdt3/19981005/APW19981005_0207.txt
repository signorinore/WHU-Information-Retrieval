Demonstrators vandalized a town hall in southern Denmark after police 
closed pubs and cafes early, news reports said Monday. Six people 
were charged with public disturbance in connection with the incident. 
Following complaints that the nightlife in Soenderborg, 240 kilometers 
(149 miles) southwest of Copenhagen had become too noisy, local authorities 
ordered pubs and cafes in the town of 30,000 to close at 4 a.m. instead 
of 5 a.m. Leaflets were distributed in pubs late Saturday urging patrons 
to gather outside the Soenderborg town hall at 4.15 a.m. Sunday, the 
local Jydske Vestkysten newspaper said. A crowd of about 200, mainly 
young people and many of them intoxicated, threw bottles and rocks 
at the building, the report said. A smaller group broke in and smashed 
computers, furniture and other office equipment estimated to be worth 
100,000 kroner (dlrs 15,625).
