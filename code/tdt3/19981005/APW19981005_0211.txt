The world's children are under increasing threat from the AIDS epidemic, 
the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS said Monday. More than 
500,000 infants are estimated to have been infected with HIV last 
year through mother-to-child transmission before or during birth or 
by breast feeding, a press release from UNAIDS said. Almost half of 
new HIV infections _ some 7,000 every day _ occur among people aged 
10-24, the release said. Adolescent girls and boys are now among those 
at the highest risk of HIV infection from having unprotected sex or 
sharing contaminated needles. Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS, 
said restricting access to sex education is a violation of children's 
rights. ``Girls and boys need to understand how to help take charge 
of their own lives _ to protect themselves and others from the virus 
in situations of risk,'' Piot said. Piot is among experts taking part 
in a meeting Monday in Geneva organized by the Committee on the Rights 
of the Child, a U.N. human rights body that monitors states' compliance 
with the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. Adopted by the 
United Nations in 1989, the convention commits the 191 governments 
that have ratified it to ensuring that all children under 18 can get 
health care, education and psychological and social support. The United 
States and Somalia have still to sign up.
