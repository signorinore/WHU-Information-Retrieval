Indonesia's beleaguered president urged the nation's powerful military 
Monday to safeguard his economic and political reform program against 
``radical revolutionaries.'' In a speech marking the 53rd anniversary 
of the founding of the military, President B.J. Habibie said Indonesia 
was threatened with national disintegration. ``Some of the radical 
revolutionary movement leaders have planned to stage actions to force 
their wishes on the people in the capital and in several regions,'' 
Habibie said, without identifying the leaders. Habibie took power 
in May when riots and protests forced President Suharto to quit after 
32 authoritarian years in power. In recent weeks Habibie has himself 
been targeted by a new wave of protests by students and others over 
his inability to stem the worst effects of a deep economic crisis 
and the slow pace of promised political reform. Looting and lawlessness 
have also erupted sporadically in some areas hit hard by soaring prices 
and food shortages. Newspapers on Monday reported that several retired 
army generals were backing a plan by student leaders to launch a 40-day 
protest campaign to force Habibie to resign. In Jakarta, hundreds 
of students and others staged three protests against the military's 
role in politics. In one instance, about 300 protesters blocked a 
major road near the Parliament after police and troops stop a street 
march. There were no reports of arrests or injuries. In his speech 
at a parade of troops at Jakarta's military base, Habibie did not 
name the groups he accused of threatening the Indonesian nation, which 
is enduring its worst economic crisis in 30 years. He said his reform 
efforts must not be ``stained by the actions of radical revolutionary 
groups, which contain the potential for destruction, disintegration 
and unconstitutionality.'' Habibie also repeated earlier calls for 
the military to reform ``its vision, mission, policy and strategy'' 
after years of human rights abuses. He said national security had 
to be maintained to protect the push for reform. ``Efforts to overcome 
the economic crisis and steps toward reform require stability and 
order,'' he said. Under Suharto, the military was accused of widespread 
human rights abuses and atrocities. However, since the old leader's 
departure from power armed forces commander Gen. Wiranto has promised 
to implement sweeping reforms and to rethink the military's role in 
society and politics. Newspapers quoted Wiranto on Monday as saying 
he did not want his troops to be regarded by Indonesians only as ``cruel 
murderers and destroyers.'' Habibie urged the military to upgrade 
its professionalism. He also backed a plan to separate the police 
force from the command of the military.
