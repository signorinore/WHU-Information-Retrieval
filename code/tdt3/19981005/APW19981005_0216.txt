The governor of Indonesia's teeming capital has warned affluent citizens 
not to flaunt their wealth in front of fast-growing numbers of poor. 
Gov. Sutiyoso was quoted by The Jakarta Post Monday as saying that 
the wearing of expensive jewelry, for instance, could provoke violent 
robberies. He was quoted as saying that rising violent crime was ``a 
consequence of the current economic crisis and never ending hardships 
faced by many people here.'' ``To protect ourselves from becoming 
a target we should first do something ourselves, such as avoid showing 
off our belongings,'' he said. Indonesia is beset by soaring inflation 
and mass unemployment in its struggle against the worst economic meltdown 
in decades. Looting broke out across the city of 11 million in May 
during riots in which 1,200 people were killed. That violence helped 
force autocratic President Suharto to quit after 32 years in power. 
The government has warned that millions of people in the capital and 
across the nation are sliding fast below its official poverty line. 
Many face food shortages as prices for basic items climb beyond their 
reach. The paper reported that police predict violent crime will increase 
as the economy crisis grinds on. It cited two recent murders. Last 
week a man was shot to death by robbers after he himself had stolen 
about dlrs 600 from his company. Earlier a woman and her 6-year-old 
daughter were killed when their house was robbed.
