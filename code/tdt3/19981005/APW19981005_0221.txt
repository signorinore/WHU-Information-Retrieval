As NATO continued with plans for a military campaign, EU foreign ministers 
on Monday debated tighter economic sanctions against Yugoslavia. However, 
it appeared unlikely the European Union's latest batch of sanctions 
_ tighter travel restrictions and freezing more Yugoslav assets abroad 
_ would be anything more than symbolic. In recent months, appeals 
from the EU, the United States and other nations for a peaceful solution 
to the Kosovo crisis have been ignored in Belgrade and economic sanctions 
have made no difference. The foreign ministers debated tighter travel 
restrictions on Yugoslav officials and extending a freeze on Serbian 
assets abroad to cover state-owned companies, such as the national 
airline JAT. The EU has sought to punish Yugoslavia for its crackdown 
against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo through an investment 
ban, an assets freeze, visa restrictions, a ban on arms exports and 
flights by Yugoslav air carriers to EU points. These sanctions have 
not moved Yugoslav leaders any closer to a peaceful solution in Kosovo, 
leading the United States and Britain to push for a phased military 
campaign, starting with air strikes.
