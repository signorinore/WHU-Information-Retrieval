On the eve of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's arrival, 
a top Palestinian official said without Israeli concessions, her latest 
peace efforts ``won't go anywhere.'' Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, 
speaking to Associated Press Television News in the West Bank town 
of Jericho, also accused the Clinton administration of allowing Israel 
to drag its feet on living up to past accords. ``I hope Madame Albright 
will end this cycle _ meeting and arranging other meetings, giving 
(Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu the extra miles _ because 
this must stop and we must move to substance,'' he told APTN. ``We 
believe that without a clear-cut Netanyahu `yes' to the American initiative 
and all its components, I think we won't go anywhere,'' Erekat said. 
The Palestinians earlier this year accepted terms of an American-authored 
plan for an Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank, but Netanyahu 
balked, citing security concerns. Talks in the United States last 
week apparently brought the two sides closer together, however. Albright 
was to meet Tuesday _ separately _ with Netanyahu and Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat. Her visit is meant to lay the groundwork for 
an Israeli-Palestinian summit in Washington sometime around Oct. 15. 
Albright was to spend only two days in the region, but was accompanied 
by mediator Dennis Ross, who will likely stay longer to try to coax 
the two sides as close to an accord as possible before any summit. 
Israeli officials had no immediate comment on Erekat's remarks. Much 
of the country was shut down for the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, which 
lasts for one week, but main commemorations were Monday. However, 
Netanyahu has consistently said that no deal is possible without better 
security cooperation from Arafat's Palestinian Authority. The Palestinians 
say even diligent efforts cannot provide total protection against 
attacks on Israel by Islamic militants. On Monday's holiday, the Palestinian 
lands remained sealed off, as they have been for much of the time 
since a series of Jewish holidays beginning with the New Year on Sept. 
20. In imposing the closure, Israel cited security threats from the 
radical Islamic group Hamas, which threatened revenge after two of 
its top members were slain last month by Israeli troops who raided 
their West Bank hideout. Hamas has killed dozens of Israelis in suicide 
bombings since 1994. In the Gaza Strip, about 500 people staged a 
rally to demand the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. 
Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, attended, but did 
not address the crowd.
