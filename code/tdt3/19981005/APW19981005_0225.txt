Indian stocks fell sharply Monday in nervous selling over fears that 
the Unit Trust of India, the country's largest mutual fund manager, 
would reduce its investment in shares. By noon Monday, the Sensex 
of the Bombay Stock Exchange, the benchmark index, was down 6 percent, 
the sharpest fall since March 31,1997, when the index fell more than 
8 percent in reaction to the fall of the United Front coalition government. 
Last week, UTI Chairman P.S. Subramanyam said its largest US-64 mutual 
fund plan was losing money because of a steep fall in share prices. 
The market has dropped in response to international sanctions slapped 
on India after it conducted nuclear tests in May and because of India's 
downgrading by international rating agencies. UTI accounts for more 
than 80 percent of investments in the mutual fund industry, and US-64 
accounts for nearly a third of UTI's investments. The UTI chairman 
said last week the fund may reduce US-64's investments in equity from 
64 percent to 60 percent. This lead to fears that UTI will emerge 
as a major seller. But Subramanyam told Dow Jones Newswires on Monday 
there are no redemption pressures on the US-64 fund, but new funds 
will be channeled into non-equity investments. ``We won't go selling 
our shares at their current prices,'' he said. ``We will invest the 
new funds in non-equity instruments and bring down the exposure in 
equities.'' Most of the selling appeared to be from small holders. 
``Corporates have reassured me they are with us,'' Subramanyam said. 
Around 30 percent of the US-64 units are held by companies. Analysts 
said another factor in the sell-off could be fears of political instability 
after the Akali Dal party, until now a staunch ally of Prime Minister 
Atal Bihari Vajpayee, threatened to withdraw support to the government 
unless a regional dispute is solved in its favor. There has been an 
across the board drop in share prices and dealers said the fall was 
because a long weekend _ it is festival season in India _ did not 
allow the market to react to political news. However, V Ramesh, general 
manager of Mafatlal Securities said Monday's fall was nothing to worry 
about. ``It's speculative hammering. I think its a good time to buy.''
