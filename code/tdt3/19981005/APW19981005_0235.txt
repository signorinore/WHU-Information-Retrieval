A South Korean diplomat called Monday for Russia and South Korea to 
sign a stalled agreement on a joint industrial area in Russia's Far 
East, a news agency said. Suk Won Tae, the Korean Consul-General in 
the Pacific port city of Vladivostok, said Korea wants an agreement 
on a free economic zone in the region to be signed as soon as possible, 
the ITAR-Tass news agency said. The zone agreement would offer tax 
and tariff concessions to more than 100 South Korean light-industry 
enterprises who set up in the 320-hectare (790-acre) area in Nakhodka, 
near Vladivostok. The firms would deal mostly in textile, timber-processing, 
and cannery operations, officials say. The original agreement to jointly 
build the dlrs 160 million complex in the zone was part of a 1992 
summit agreement, but financial problems in Russia and South Korea 
have delayed its development.
