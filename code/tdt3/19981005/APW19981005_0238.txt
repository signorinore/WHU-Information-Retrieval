A Sudanese warplane bombed two towns in northwestern Uganda, wounding 
six people, Ugandan and aid officials said Monday. The target appeared 
to be Sudanese refugees, said Nino Tomoko, spokeswoman for the U.N. 
refugee agency. About 158,756 refugees from Sudan's 15-year civil 
war are in more than two dozen settlements in the area. An Antonov 
dropped six bombs on Pakele and four on Adjumani on Saturday evening, 
wounding four women and two children, and destroying two huts, said 
Steven Kavuma, state minister for defense. ``The government of Uganda 
condemns this act of aggression,'' Kavuma said of the attacks on the 
towns 350 kilometers (220 miles) northwest of Kampala. In Khartoum, 
the government denied Sudan had bombed Uganda. ``This is not true, 
and they have to provide the evidence,'' said Hassan Abdin, permanent 
secretary in the Sudanese Foreign Ministry. The bombs fell outside 
the compounds of the U.N. World Food Program and U.N. High Commissioner 
for Refugees, WFP spokeswoman Michele Quintaglie said in Nairobi, 
Kenya. ``Our compounds are the most heavily lit buildings in the area,'' 
making them good targets, she said. Uganda has several times in the 
past accused Sudan of bombings in the north, including in February 
1997 when eight civilians were injured in Moyo. In Khartoum, state-run 
newspapers said that 98 Eritrean soldiers were killed in fighting 
in East Equatoria province in southern Sudan since mid-September. 
There was no way to verify the claim independently. Sudan has charged 
repeatedly that both Eritrea and Uganda were supporting the latest 
offensive by the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army. Both countries 
have denied the allegations. The Sudanese media said that an estimated 
600 Eritreans currently were fighting inside Sudan. It said that among 
those killed was an Eritrean officer, identified as Omar Tashombi, 
who commanded artillery units. He was killed when a rebel howitzer 
was destroyed the reports said, without elaboration. Uganda broke 
diplomatic relations with Sudan in 1995 after both sides accused the 
other of supporting rebel groups. Sudanese rebels, drawing support 
from Christians and followers of tribal religions, have been waging 
a military campaign against the Islamic-led Sudanese government since 
1983 for more autonomy for the southern districts. About 1.5 million 
people have been killed in the fighting and resulting famines.
