The head of the Social Democrats said in an interview published Monday 
that his party colleagues in eastern Germany should bring the ex-communists 
into a state government to make them more responsible. Social Democratic 
chairman Oskar Lafontaine and other party leaders have ruled out working 
with the successor to the East German communists on the federal level 
because of its past. But even Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder has 
softened his stance about cooperation on the state level, saying recently 
that the ``different conditions'' in the east made such a coalition 
possible. Lafontaine told Der Spiegel newsmagazine it would also take 
some of the shine off the ex-communists and their assertion ``that 
they would do everything much better, if only they were allowed to.'' 
``I think it's wrong to allow the (former communists) to escape responsibility 
for government,'' he said. ``That just gives them the opportunity 
to demand everything and have to answer for nothing.'' The Social 
Democrats finished on top in state elections in Mecklenburg-Western 
Pomerania on Sept. 27, but must form a coalition to achieve a majority 
in parliament. Governor-elect Harald Ringstorff has been talking both 
with the Christian Democrats, which headed the last coalition but 
finished second this time, and the Party of Democratic Socialism, 
successor to the East German communists and third strongest party. 
The Social Democrats have governed in another eastern German state, 
Saxony-Anhalt, since spring with the tacit support of the PDS, but 
the party has never officially been part of a coalition government.
