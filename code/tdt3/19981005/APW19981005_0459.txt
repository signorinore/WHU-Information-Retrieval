Amsterdam soccer club Ajax said Monday it is in talks with Belgium's 
Germinal Ekeren on a possible cooperation pact. But a spokesman declined 
to confirm a report in the Amsterdam daily Het Parool that the club 
wants a 51 percent stake in Germinal Ekeren, which is in the Belgian 
soccer league's first division. Ajax spokesman Erik van Leeuwen said 
the talks are part of the club's new strategy to gain a higher profile 
through takeovers or cooperation with other clubs worldwide on projects 
ranging from merchandising to training. The strategy has been spurred 
on by Ajax's listing on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange earlier this 
year, he added.
