LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ UEFA's executive committee meets Tuesday in 
the Portuguese capital to put the finishing touches on its new-look 
European Champions' Cup competition in response to proposals for a 
rival European Super League. Officials from European soccer's governing 
body will choose one of two proposed new formats for its revamped 
Champions' Cup competition _ one involving 24 clubs and another with 
32. The shake-up was unveiled last week in Geneva by UEFA's European 
Football 2000 Task Force, which was quickly set up to combat the breakaway 
Super League's promise of jackpot payouts for the continent's top 
clubs if they defect from UEFA. UEFA's proposal offers dlrs 440-590 
million in total prize money, with the winners pocketing dlrs 44-59 
million. The final sums depend on the format chosen by the executive 
committee. That still falls short of the dlrs 1.2 billion reportedly 
promised by Media Partners, the Milan-based marketing firm behind 
the Super League. UEFA's insistence on retaining control of broadcasting 
and marketing rights is another snag to be overcome. UEFA favors the 
24-club concept because the fewer number of games would be easier 
to slot into already tight soccer schedules. UEFA is also examining 
the possibility of pay-per-view and pay television to finance the 
new model. UEFA's scramble to make its most prestigious competition 
more attractive came after Media Partners moved to lure some of the 
biggest names in European soccer away from the body that has run the 
sport for decades. Manchester United, Inter and AC Milan, Bayern Munich 
and Barcelona _ clubs which draw huge television audiences and generate 
millions of dollars in spin-off businesses _ are some of the clubs 
targeted by Media Partners. UEFA has countered in two ways _ jacking 
up the cash on offer and threatening to suspend defecting clubs from 
the national leagues. The executive committee will also announce the 
venues for next year's finals of the three UEFA club competitions: 
UEFA, Cup Winners and European Champions Cup. UEFA has listed 22 possible 
sites, separating them into 12 stadiums described as five-star and 
10 four-star stadiums across Europe. The Champions Cup final will 
be staged in a five-star stadium, with the other two finals at either 
four- or five-star venues.
