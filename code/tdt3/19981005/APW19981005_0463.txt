Police opened fire to break up a rioting between rival Hindu castes 
in southern India over the weekend. Nine people were killed in the 
incidents, six from police gunfire and three from rioting, Press Trust 
of India news agency reported Monday. Police arrested 35 people and 
charged them with violence and looting shops in or near Ramanathapuram, 
a town in Tamil Nadu state, PTI said. Clashes often occur in this 
area between the Thevar Peravi, who are upper caste landowners, and 
Dalits, the lower castes who often are tenant farmers and say they 
face discrimination. More than 2,000 paramilitary police forces took 
position in the troubled district Monday with instructions to shoot 
rioters, PTI said. Ramanathapuram is 550 kilometers (340 miles) south 
of Madras, the state capital. Nearly 200 people from the upper caste 
began a hunger strike Monday demanding a judicial probe into police 
action during the rioting that hit the district on Saturday and Sunday. 
Police fired on a mob of lower caste Hindus Saturday night at Tiruppullani 
village, 10 kilometers (six miles) from Ramanathapuram, when they 
attacked members of an upper caste group. The rioting spread to Ramannthapuram 
on Sunday and police again used gunfire to control the situation, 
PTI said. The clashes followed attacks by the upper caste community 
on a Dalit rally in the region last month, police said.
