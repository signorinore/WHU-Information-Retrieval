Politicians wanting to run for office in the Norwegian capital on 
the Conservative Party ticket will have to sign a moral pact pledging 
their closets are free of embarrassing skeletons. The pact is intended 
to keep convicted criminals and tax cheaters off the party ticket. 
It does not cover personal matters such as sexual orientation. ``It 
is a big advantage to play with an open hand,'' said Oslo party leader 
Anders Sjaastad in an interview with the Norwegian radio network NRK. 
``If exposure could lead to problems for the party, then it is better 
to take precautions and perhaps drop being a candidate,'' he added. 
The party guideline will apply for next year's local elections in 
Oslo. The Norwegian news media generally respect the private lives 
of public figures. However, when it comes to legal and tax matters, 
Norway's reporters will dig as aggressively as any in the world. In 
recent years, a Central Bank governor and a top Labor Party official 
both resigned after reports of tax improprieties. Sjaastad said candidates 
should expect such investigations of their financial matters, but 
that he hopes probes in Norway never resemble those faced by President 
Bill Clinton and other public figures in the United States.
