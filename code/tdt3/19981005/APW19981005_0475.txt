The U.S.S. Mitscher, a destroyer with America's 6th Fleet, was leaving 
Algiers Monday after a three-day stopover that included joint maneuvers 
-- the first such operation since this nation's independence in 1962. 
The Sunday aero-naval maneuvers, 25 miles (40 kms) off the coast of 
Sidi Fredj, west of the capital, included search and rescue operations 
with the Algerian Navy. More than 430 members of the Algerian Navy 
took part, officials said. The joint maneuvers come amid what appears 
to be warming diplomatic and commercial ties between the United States 
and this North African nation, rich in gas and oil but long considered 
a preserve of its former colonial ruler, France. The French-language 
daily El Watan said the maneuvers underscored ``the deepening degree 
of Algerian-American relations.'' NATO's southern European commander, 
Adm. T. Joseph Lopez, paid a rare visit over the summer to Algiers. 
A delegation of the American-Algerian Chamber of Commerce recently 
visited Algiers, opening an office here, a sign that foreign concerns 
which have largely shunned Algeria over the past six years are reassessing. 
Authorities have been engaged in a violent confrontation with Islamic 
extremists waging an insurgency since 1992, when the army canceled 
legislative elections that a Muslim fundamentalist party was poised 
to win. An estimated 75,000 people have been killed in the continuing 
violence.
