The president of cycling's governing body Monday defended a decision 
to reduce the bans for three Swiss riders who admitted during the 
scandal-hit Tour de France to taking performance enhancing drugs. 
``For these riders, 90 percent of the season is the Tour de France,'' 
said Hein Verbruggen, president of the International Cycling Union, 
adding that reducing the ban by one month would give the riders a 
chance to prepare for next season's Tour. The cyclists, Alex Zuelle, 
Laurent Dufaux and Armin Meier, all members of the Festina Team that 
was kicked off the Tour because of its systematic doping policy, were 
handed eight-month bans by Switzerland's cycling federation, but the 
International Cycling Union (UCI) reduced the sentences to seven months 
which will end May 1, 1999.. ``The whole Festina team really concentrates 
on the Tour de France. They have already missed one Tour de France 
which is 90 percent of their season,'' Verbruggen said. The UCI Management 
Committee, meeting ahead of the cycling World Championships that begin 
Tuesday in Valkenburg, said the cyclists should be credited for ``taking 
responsibility for their actions.'' The three Swiss riders all admitted 
taking the banned performance enhancer EPO while with the Festina 
team after they were taking in for questioning by French justice authorities.. 
Verbruggen said the seven-month sentence was appropriate due to the 
specific nature of the sport and the season. ``This element of specificity 
is fully accepted,'' Verbruggen said, adding that a six-month ban 
for a cyclist could wipe out an entire season or have virtually no 
effect depending on when it came into force. The management committee 
also agreed to set up an anti-doping working group funded by national 
federations, cycling teams and riders to help come to terms with the 
widespread drug abuse in the sport.. Verbruggen will be joined on 
the group by representatives of professional teams and riders. 1996 
Tour de France winner Bjarne Riis was named as one of the riders' 
representatives.
