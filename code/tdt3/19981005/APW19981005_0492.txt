The European Championships qualifying encounter between Yugoslavia 
and the Republic of Ireland this weekend will be postponed for security 
reasons, European soccer's governing body UEFA announced Monday. The 
match, due to be played Saturday in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade, 
has been put off ``in view of the political situation in Yugoslavia 
and the subsequent effects at international level,'' a press release 
said. A UEFA spokeswoman didn't give any further details. A new date 
and possible change of venue will be set by the Euro 2000 organizing 
committee in consultation with the Irish and Yugoslav national soccer 
associations, UEFA said. The corresponding under-21 match between 
the two countries has been postponed for the same reasons, the release 
said. Last week, England called off an exhibition next month at Wembley 
stadium against Yugoslavia because of the conflict in Kosovo and the 
possibility of military intervention.
