Some 2,000 protesters demonstrated outside the European headquarters 
of U.S. textile giant Levi Strauss Monday, demanding that the bluejeans 
company overturn its decision to close four plants in Belgium and 
France. Levi Strauss announced last week it wants to cut some 1,560 
jobs in three Belgian and one north French factory as part of a European 
restructuring plan. Unions have demanded management save at least 
part of the jobs. Scuffles broke out outside the European headquarters 
and police had to intervene to keep protesters at bay. The company 
held a European board meeting at the same time. The protesters set 
fire to Levi's jeans' in front of the headquarters and were throwing 
eggs at the front entrance. The workers have been on strike since 
the company announced its plans last week. Company officials said 
production facilities in Belgium and France were singled out because 
of high labor costs and overcapacity. About 7,500 of the company's 
30,000 employees are based in Europe. The layoffs will represent about 
20 percent of the company's European staff.
