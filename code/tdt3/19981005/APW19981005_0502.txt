A body probing apartheid human rights abuses on Monday granted amnesty 
to an African National Congress supporter jailed in 1994 for mob violence. 
Ben Sepato Lehloo is serving nine years for being part of a mob that 
in 1993 stoned the house of a man alleged to be a supporter of the 
former ruling National Party. A car was also burned in the attack 
at Rustenburg, near Johannesburg. Lehloo was to be released from jail. 
Set up in 1995, a year after all-race elections ended white rule, 
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is charged with probing atrocities 
committed by all sides in the fight against apartheid. It can grant 
amnesty to those who tell the full truth about their crimes and prove 
a political motive.
