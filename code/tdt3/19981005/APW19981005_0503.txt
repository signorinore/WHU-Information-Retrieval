Military authorities have arrested 20 rebels linked to the country's 
former government that was ousted after a civil war last year, police 
announced Monday. The rebels, members of the Ninja force loyal to 
deposed President Pascal Lissouba, were caught about 40 kilometers 
(25 miles) south of the capital of Brazzaville. The arrests come after 
military officials say pockets of rebel forces have launched a number 
of attacks on civilian and government targets. ``This bandit army 
has attacked post offices and the homes of government officials,'' 
a military spokesman said on customary condition of anonymity. One 
post office just outside of Brazzaville was fire-bombed last month. 
Although the Republic of Congo has been relatively quiet since the 
end of its civil war a year ago, the recent attacks have rekindled 
fears of a new round of fighting between President Denis Sassou-Nguesso's 
government troops and rebel forces still loyal to Lissouba. Sassou-Nguesso, 
the Republic of Congo's former Marxist dictator, lost power in elections 
several years ago, but fought his way back to power after he said 
Lissouba had rigged preparations for subsequent elections. His Cobra 
militia and allied Angolan forces drove Lissouba from power last year 
after he tried to disarm the militia force.
