The European Union nations agreed Monday to accelerate enlargement 
talks with five eastern neighbors and Cyprus but ignored a demand 
by France and the Netherlands that Cyprus must be cautioned it can 
only join if it first ends its division. ``We want a political solution 
for the island under the aegis of the United Nations,'' said Austrian 
Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, whose country holds the EU presidency, 
said during an EU foreign ministers meeting. He reiterated the EU's 
stated view that simply starting enlargement talks was bound to have 
a spillover effect and ``facilitate a political settlement'' of Cyprus' 
division. Also Monday, the foreign ministers asked the European Commission 
to ``reassess'' its 1993 approval of Malta's 1990 membership application. 
The Mediterranean island nation reapplied Sept. 11 after its previous 
government put EU membership on ice. They also welcomed the recent 
election victory of opposition parties in Slovakia, saying they hoped 
for a restoration of full democracy there after six years of autocratic 
rule by Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. Schuessel told reporters ``screening'' 
talks to date with Cyprus, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia 
and Slovenia are going well enough to accelerate the negotiations 
with these countries on Nov. 10. France and the Netherlands wanted 
a caution to Cyprus, that it can only join if it is first reunified. 
The foreign ministers did not act on the Franco-Dutch request. Cyprus 
has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded the north 
following an abortive coup by elements favoring union with Greece. 
Turkish Cypriots have declared their own Turkish Republic of Northern 
Cyprus, labeled illegal by the United Nations and recognized only 
by Turkey. Cyprus' Greek Cypriot government and those of the five 
East European nations opened ``screening'' talks with the EU in March. 
To become an EU member, candidates must adopt the entire spectrum 
of EU rules, regulations and laws. These cover 31 chapters _ from 
agriculture, energy, foreign affairs and monetary union to corporate 
and banking laws, consumer health protection and telecommunications 
standards and practices. Estonia has said by 2002 or 2003 it will 
be EU-compatible in 12 chapters, Hungary in 11. Poland, the Czech 
Republic, Slovenia and Cyprus say they will comply with seven chapters 
by then. The recommendation to start more detailed talks came in a 
report from the EU Commission. The EU has not fixed an entry date 
for any of the six ``fast-track'' candidates. In addition, Lithuania, 
Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria are also in line to join, albeit 
much later.
