Four German teen-agers were arrested Monday on attempted murder charges 
stemming from a neo-Nazi gang attack on two Iranian refugees that 
left one seriously injured. The two Iranian teen-agers were headed 
home Sept. 26 in Leipzig when they were attacked by a large group 
wielding baseball bats, iron rods and fists. One managed to flee, 
but the other Iranian, who is 16 years old, was beaten so severely 
he remains hospitalized in serious condition and may have permanent 
injuries, police in the eastern state of Saxony said. The four suspects 
arrested Monday are between 17 and 19 years old, police said. Nine 
others from the far right scene were questioned and released, but 
the investigation against them remains open. Also Monday, police in 
the nearby city of Erfurt said they had opened an investigation into 
a week-old attack on a teacher who was beaten up while trying to protect 
his students on a school trip from a group of 10 skinheads. Police 
director Reiner Grube said no complaints had been filed about the 
attack, which they only learned about Monday by reading a report in 
the Bild tabloid newspaper. Bild identified the teach only as Lothar 
B., 47, from western Germany and said he suffered several broken ribs 
and a broken tooth. Grube said police had not yet been able to contact 
the teacher.
