The trial of a young couple accused of killing a 16-year-old schoolmate 
during an intimate encounter began Monday at a juvenile court in suburban 
Paris. The parents of Abdeladim, the victim, burst into tears as the 
accused, Veronique Herbert, now 20, and Sebastien, now 19, entered 
the courtroom. Under French law, the last names of Sebastien and Abdeladim 
have not been released because they were minors at the time of the 
killing. Prosecutors say Veronique and Sebastien lured Abdeladim to 
Sebastien's house in March 1996, telling him Veronique was attracted 
to him. In Sebastien's room, Veronique and Abdeladim took off their 
clothes and became intimate as Sebastien watched, prosecutors said. 
Then, on Veronique's cue, Sebastien began stabbing Abdeladim, and 
Veronique joined in, prosecutors said. The two allegedly buried the 
body and fled. They were captured three days after the murder. At 
Monday's trial, when judges asked Veronique for her occupation, the 
young woman with long, dark hair responded without hesitation, ``I 
am a student.'' Sebastien, wearing jeans, told judges he was studying 
to be a professional cleaner at a trade school. The evidence presented 
to the jury included a videotape of Oliver Stone's 1994 movie ``Natural 
Born Killers.'' According to the prosecution, Veronique had a morbid 
fascination for the film, which follows a young, much-in-love couple 
on a killing spree, with the attendant media attention. Although the 
first 40 minutes of the trial were open to reporters and the public, 
the rest of the trial will be held behind closed doors until Friday, 
when the verdict is expected. The young couple face life imprisonment 
if convicted.
