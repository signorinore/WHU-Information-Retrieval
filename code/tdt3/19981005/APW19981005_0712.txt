China signed a key human rights treaty Monday that calls for freedom 
of expression, religion and self-determination and pledged its willingness 
to safeguard human rights. The International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights is one of two accords seen as fundamental to protecting 
human rights. China has signed the other one _ the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights _ but hasn't ratified it. 
In a signing ceremony at U.N. headquarters, China's U.N. ambassador, 
Qin Huasun, said the Chinese government was deliberating now on ratifying 
that accord. ``All these have demonstrated the firm resolve of China 
to promote and protect human rights,'' Qin said. Meanwhile, in Beijing 
police hauled a prominent human rights campaigner in for questioning 
Monday. Qin Yongmin's latest run-in with the authorities came as he 
tried for the second time in a week to legally register a human rights 
monitoring group. The Chinese ambassador told reporters after signing 
the accord that China believed in dialogue on the question of human 
rights ``on the basis of mutual respect.'' He said a recent trip to 
China by the top U.N. human rights official, Mary Robinson, helped 
both sides understand each other better. ``I would like to reaffirm 
here the willingness of the Chinese government to further its cooperation 
with the U.N. in the field of human rights in an effort to push forward 
together the development of the international cause of human rights.'' 
Qin's signing came exactly 31 years after Taiwan signed the accord, 
when it was still a member state of the United Nations. The Taiwanese 
government lost its seat in the United Nations in 1971 when the organization 
accepted the Communist government in Beijing as the sole representative 
of the Chinese people. Qin concluded his comments by declaring Taiwan's 
signature illegal and ``null and void.'' The treaty was adopted by 
the U.N. General Assembly in 1966 and went into force a decade later. 
Since then, 140 countries have ratified it or acceded to it. The treaty 
states that all people have the right of self-determination. It prohibits 
torture, cruel or degrading punishment and provides for freedom of 
movement, thought, religion and expression, among other things. States 
that have signed on to the treaty are required to submit an initial 
report within one year of ratification, and periodic reports every 
five years thereafter.
