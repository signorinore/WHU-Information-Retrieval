Gunmen fatally shot three brothers, all of them members of the African 
National Congress, in a region of smouldering political violence, 
police said on Monday. George Ngubane, an ANC branch secretary, and 
his brothers Zenzamuhle and Sipho were slain as they were driving 
on Sunday afternoon at Inadi in the Midlands region of KwaZulu-Natal. 
Police said six other people were seriously injured in the ambush 
and 53 spent AK-47 cartridges were found at the scene. The Indian 
Ocean province of KwaZulu-Natal was the scene of a low-level civil 
war in the 1980s and 1990s between the ruling ANC and the Zulu nationalist 
Inkatha Freedom Party that killed 10,000 people. Though now more peaceful, 
political violence in the region still flares. Recently a feud between 
the ANC and another opposition group, the United Democratic Movement, 
has cost dozens of lives in the Midlands' town of Richmond near Durban. 
Political analysts fear that violence may be on the rise again as 
the country gears up for national elections next year. Sipho Gcabashe, 
ANC provincial secretary in KwaZulu-Natal, called for calm in the 
wake of the latest murders. He blamed them on unnamed political opponents 
trying to stop the ANC from organizing in the area. ``This is an act 
by those elements who still believe that their selfish sectarian political 
interest can be safe if the ANC remains a banned organization in their 
areas,''Gcabashe said.
