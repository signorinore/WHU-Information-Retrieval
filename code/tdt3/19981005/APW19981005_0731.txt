President Negasso Ghidada Monday suggested that new international 
efforts would soon be underway to resolve the border conflict between 
Ethiopia and Eritrea that erupted into fighting four months ago. ``Countries 
that were involved with the facilitation process in the beginning 
... are coming up with fresh and renewed peace endeavors,'' Negassao 
told the opening session of the 1998-99 parliament. Although he did 
not name any countries, he appeared to be referring to the United 
States and Rwanda, whose joint mission to both countries in June failed 
to come up with a solution. Former U.S. national security adviser 
Anthony Lake is scheduled to arrive in Asmara, the Eritrean capital, 
Tuesday, and will leave for Ethiopia Thursday. He may return to Asmara 
Friday. Ethiopia has expressed willingness to hold talks with Eritrea 
but only after Asmara withdraws its troops from territories occupied 
after May 12, when the fighting broke out. Eritrea has refused, saying 
it is on its own territory as deliniated in Italian colonial maps 
in the first part of the century. Leaders of Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe 
and Djibouti, named by the Organization of African Unity to come up 
with peace proposals, are to meet Oct. 15 in Ouagadougou, the Burkina 
capital, to discuss what they have come up with. Negasso said Ethiopia 
was still committed to a peaceful resolution of the conflict but was 
rapidly losing patience. ``The governmentof Ethiopia still views war 
as a last resort to settle inter-state disputes and is committed to 
exhaust all possible avenues of peace, whereas the Eritrean regime 
has demonstrated time and again its intransigence,'' he said.
