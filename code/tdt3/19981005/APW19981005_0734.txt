Two athletes _ cyclist Stephen Alfred of Trinidad and Tobago and shooting 
competitor Rustam Khan of Pakistan _ tested positive for banned substances 
in last month's Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, officials 
said Monday. Alfred, who placed eighth in the men's cycling sprint 
event, tested positive for the banned substance norandrosterone. As 
a consequence, Commonwealth Games officials based in London disqualified 
him from the Kuala Lumpur games and also banned him from the 2002 
games in Manchester, England. Khan, who tested positive for propanolol, 
also had his results nullified. His case was referred to the Commonwealth 
Games Association of Pakistan and the International Shooting Federation 
to impose sanctions.
