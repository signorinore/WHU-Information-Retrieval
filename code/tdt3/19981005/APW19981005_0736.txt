The main opposition group wants Prime Minister Goeran Persson to explain 
how the ruling Social Democrats plan to govern the next four years 
after last month's desultory election results. ``It's morally wrong 
that the losers of the elections rule on,'' Anders Bjoerk of the conservative 
Moderate Party said Monday. On Sept. 20, the Social Democrats won 
36.6 percent of the vote _ more than any other party, but nevertheless 
their worst showing in decades and far below the 45 percent they tallied 
in 1994. The Moderates polled 22.5 percent, and the four non-socialist 
parties received a total of 159 seats in the 349-seat Riksdag parliament. 
That's more than the Social Democrats' 131 seats, but short of a majority. 
The issue is how _ or whether _ the Social Democrats would cooperate 
poltically with the ex-Communist Left Party and the Greens. When parliament 
resumes Tuesday, Persson was scheduled to outline the Social Democrats' 
projected policies during the next four years. The Moderates were 
considering raising a formal challenge to test how strong parliamentary 
support is for the government. A challenge requires the support of 
just 35 members in the Riksdag, but a majority would be needed to 
topple the government. That has never happened in Swedish politics.
