Buffeted by troubles at home and abroad, prices on the Amsterdam Stock 
Exchange closed sharply lower Monday, pushing the benchmark index 
to the lowest close since early June 1997. The 27-share AEX Index 
finished Monday at 829.31 points, down 19.28 points, or 2.3 percent, 
but off its intraday low of 825.98 points. A profit warning late Friday 
by ABN Amro, the largest Dutch bank, pushed down its shares by 3.1 
percent. Internationally, the lack of concrete measures coming out 
of the Group of Seven's weekend meeting to fight the global financial 
crisis and ongoing troubles in Asia was responsible for the overall 
gloomy sentiment in Amsterdam. The lower opening on Wall Street Monday 
weighed on stocks even further.
