Georgia seeks closer ties with NATO to promote the country's integration 
in Europe and to support Georgian sciences that used to serve the 
Soviet military, President Eduard Shevardnadze said Monday. NATO Secretary 
General-Javier Solana met with Shevardnadze last week, when he visited 
Georgia as part of his tour of Caucasus countries. ``We use cooperation 
with NATO not so much for developing our military potential _ that 
is impossible for us _ but for speeding up the integration into European 
structures,'' Shevardnadze said in a radio interview Monday. ``We 
consider this a political guarantee of stability and sovereignty.'' 
``We are working more actively with NATO also to save and develop 
our fundamental sciences that used to serve the military industry 
in the Soviet times,'' Shevardnadze said. Georgia joined NATO's Partnership 
for Peace program in 1994, but has not sought membership in the alliance. 
Georgian officials have said the republic was not ready for such a 
step, and they do not want to antagonize Russia, which adamantly objects 
to NATO membership by former Soviet republics.
