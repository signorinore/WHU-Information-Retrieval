More than half the members of Iran's hard-line parliament have signed 
a letter saying the death edict against British author Salman Rushdie 
stands. The letter, broadcast Sunday on Iranian television, was prompted 
by Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi's announcement last month distancing 
the government from the fatwa and the dlrs 2.5 million bounty placed 
on Rushdie's head in 1989 by a semi-official Iranian foundation. ``As 
Majlis deputies, we assure Muslims all over the world that, in this 
case, nothing except the decrees issued by God and (Khomeini) in Iran 
have any credibility and no one has the power to follow any other 
path,'' said the letter, according to the television report. Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini, the late Iranian leader, said that Rushdie must 
die for blaspheming Islam in his novel ``The Satanic Verses.'' The 
Rushdie affair strained ties with the European Union. Moderate President 
Mohammad Khatami, who defeated Nateq-Nouri in elections in 1997, has 
been trying to improve ties with the West since he took office. Britain 
announced the resumption of ties after Kharrazi's announcement Ali 
Akbar Nateq-Nouri, the parliament speaker left Sunday for talks in 
Italy and Spain, to discuss political issues and to expand trade relations 
between Tehran and the two countries. Nateq-Nouri, also known as a 
hard-liner, has not publicly commented on the government's distancing 
itself from the fatwa.
