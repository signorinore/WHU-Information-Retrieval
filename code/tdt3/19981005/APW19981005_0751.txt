International leaders are ratcheting up the pressure on Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless 
he takes decisive action to end the crisis in Kosovo province. Fearing 
airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air defense on high 
alert, but tried a belated compromise by moving some tanks and other 
heavy equipment out of Kosovo. A Western diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav 
army armored vehicles, including tanks, have been pulled out. In New 
York, U.N. chief Kofi Annan told the U.N. Security Council that ``systematic 
terror'' had been inflicted on Kosovo civilians recently and Yugoslav 
forces were mostly responsible. But Annan said he did not have the 
means to verify Milosevic's compliance with U.N. resolutions demanding 
a cease-fire. He suggested the panel's 15 members make their own judgment. 
NATO's secretary-general Javier Solana, however, said Monday that 
Yugoslavia had not complied with U.N. resolutions on Kosovo and stressed 
that NATO was ready to launch a military attack. ``The reality coming 
to us is that the compliance is not yet in place,'' Solana told reporters.
