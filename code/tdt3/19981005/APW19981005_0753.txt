As hundreds of Kosovo Albanians protested outside U.N. offices in 
Switzerland for military intervention, rebels fighting for independence 
for the Serbian province on Monday denied committing atrocities against 
Serbs. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Monday that although 
the United Nations believes Serb forces are responsible for the great 
majority of atrocities so far in Kosovo, there is reason to believe 
ethnic Albanian forces have also committed them. He didn't give examples. 
On Wednesday, the chief of the U.N. refugee agency, Sadako Ogata, 
said she believes the KLA is also guilty of using ``excessive force.'' 
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Julia Taft, speaking in Geneva on 
Monday, blamed Milosevic for the Kosovo refugee crisis but added that 
he had ``had some help'' from the KLA. ``We have never committed acts 
which violate human rights,'' insisted Bardhyl Mahmuti, political 
representative of the Kosovo Liberation Army. Mahmuti called the claims 
``absolutely inaccurate'' and demanded proof to back them up. The 
United States warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Friday 
that NATO will strike Serb targets within two weeks unless he complies 
with every U.N. demand to halt his assault on ethnic Albanians, to 
allow relief to reach refugees and to negotiate peace. Taft, who visited 
Kosovo in August, said if Belgrade doesn't comply, any NATO action 
would be an ``investment that would have to be made'' to ensure the 
humanitarian crisis doesn't continue into winter and beyond. She said 
any action would be short term and wouldn't target people. ``We have 
been working with the (aid agencies) and the U.N. agencies to ensure 
they will have every warning so they can withdraw from Kosovo in time,'' 
Taft added. Hundreds of people brandishing banners reading ``Peace 
and Liberty for Kosovo'' and ``Military Intervention for Kosovo'' 
protested Monday outside the U.N. European headquarters in Geneva, 
demanding NATO military strikes against Serb forces. Forces from Serbia, 
the larger of two republics comprising Yugoslavia, have been trying 
since February to crush the ethnic Albanian KLA. Hundreds of people 
have died in the fighting in the largely ethnic Albanian province 
and 275,000 have been routed from their homes. ``We are here to protest 
against the indifference of the international community to what is 
happening in Kosovo,'' Avdija Ramadan, one of the demonstration's 
organizers, said. Jashar Salihu, another KLA spokesman, urged immediate 
military action against Serb security forces and reiterated the KLA's 
determination to continue fighting for independence for the province. 
``The only language the Serb regime understands is the language of 
force,'' Salihu added. Meanwhile, the Swiss government said 68 percent 
of asylum applications made in September in the country came from 
Yugoslavia. Some 4,581 applications were made, almost double last 
year's figure.
