A policeman was found guilty and given a large fine Monday for injuring 
a protester during a demonstration at the Gorleben nuclear waste storage 
site in northern Germany last year. The state administrative court 
in Dannenberg, 75 kilometers (40 miles) southeast of Hamburg, fined 
the officer 16,800 marks (dlrs 30,300) for what it ruled was an unprovoked 
tear gas attack on the protester, who told the court he had only wanted 
to talk to the policeman. While the policeman claimed he had felt 
threatened when he was approached by the protester, a video clip of 
the March 2, 1997 incident gave no indication the officer was in danger, 
the court said. Court spokesman Peter Reif said the policeman had 
accepted the decision and did not plan to appeal.
