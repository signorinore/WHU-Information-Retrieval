The confessed abductors of a Spanish businessman went on trial Monday, 
claiming they released the victim two months after kidnapping him 
in 1995. Three members of a small armed leftist group called the GRAPO 
have admitted abducting businessman Publio Cordon in June 1995 and 
demanding 500 million pesetas (dlrs three million) in ransom from 
his family. The group has repeatedly insisted that Cordon was freed 
after the negotiated ransom was received in August, but the businessman 
never reappeared. On the eve of the National Court trial in Madrid, 
the pro-Basque newspaper Euskadi Informacion published an alleged 
GRAPO communique saying that Cordon was alive, well and living in 
the Dominican Republic. The defense intends to argue that the businessman 
decided to go underground because of serious financial problems in 
his companies, national Spanish radio reported. Family members have 
claimed that he remains a captive, possibly held by a fourth GRAPO 
member involved in the kidnapping. The fugitive, Fernando Silva is 
being tried in his absence alongside his three colleagues Enrique 
Cuadra, Concepcion Gonzalez and Jose Ortin. GRAPO, a Spanish acronym 
for October First Antifascist Resistance Group, is blamed for killing 
60 people in infrequent bombing and shooting attacks since it first 
appeared in the early 1970s. Its political aims have never been very 
clear and police are unsure what the group sought to achieve with 
the kidnapping. The prosecution is seeking 28 year sentences for the 
accused. Defense attorneys are expected to argue for lesser terms 
of up to 10 years. The last action attributed to the group was a small 
package bomb which slightly injured two police officers and caused 
minor damage to a private insurance company in June.
