PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO air attacks on President Slobodan 
Milosevic's Yugoslav forces might give ethnic Albanians in Kosovo 
a psychological lift but are unlikely to help rebel fighters on the 
ground. Some critics, the Serbs among them, say attacking Milosevic 
would turn NATO into the Kosovo Liberation Army's air force, doing 
what the rag-tag bands of mountain fighters have been unable to accomplish 
on their own since the conflict began in February. Veljko Odalovic, 
head of the local government in the Pristina region, says NATO strikes 
would be direct support to separatist rebels the Serbs call ``terrorists.'' 
``I expect an escalation of the conflict and an increase in terrorist 
activity,'' he said. But military experts and political observers 
say this isn't so. The primary aim of any allied missile and bomb 
attacks would be coercive, an attempt to force the tough Yugoslav 
leader to cease his relentless crackdown on the Albanian population 
of this southern Serbian province where hundreds have died and 275,000 
have been displaced _ most of them civilians. While the allies want 
to see Milosevic back down, they do not want to support ethnic Albanian 
aspirations for independence, which would be yet another sliver in 
the slicing of the former Yugoslavia. If the attacks forced Milosevic 
to withdraw substantial numbers of police and troops from Kosovo, 
where ethnic Albanians make up the vast majority of the population, 
it would ease the pressure on the KLA and perhaps even let them regain 
territory. But it would not present them with any substantial military 
advantage, the experts say. ``I think NATO can carry out strikes and 
not militarily help the KLA by hitting targets like air defense and 
command and control centers,'' said Paul Beaver, a Balkans expert 
for Jane's Defense Group in London. ``If they started to attack heavy 
artillery on the ground, or vehicles on the ground, however, that 
might help the KLA.'' That is not part of the NATO plan _ at least 
not initially. The most likely scenario is phased air attacks, starting 
with targets like air defense and radar in order to protect the NATO 
forces themselves, followed by a period of reflection and negotiations, 
then more strikes. The KLA released a statement Monday in Pristina, 
the provincial capital, supporting NATO strikes. ``The international 
community's and NATO's latest threats of a military intervention are 
the most serious yet and we wish they would become reality,'' KLA 
spokesman Jakup Krasniqi said in a statement published in the Albanian 
language newspaper Bujku. Milos Vasic, a military analyst at Belgrade's 
weekly Vreme magazine, said airstrikes certainly would boost KLA morale. 
``They are going to call it their own air support,'' he said. ``It 
will be a political tool to try to get more supporters.'' None of 
the allies want to be seen taking sides against one of the warring 
factions. The reality is, however, Western nations are repulsed by 
Serb conduct in Kosovo, particularly the heavy toll on civilians. 
At the same time, many also believe that the KLA is not the heroic 
band of freedom fighters they often are made out to be, and are responsible 
themselves for much of the fighting that has gone on in the province. 
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Monday that although the 
United Nations believes Serb forces are responsible for most atrocities 
in Kosovo, there is reason to believe Serb claims that ethnic Albanian 
forces have also committed them. Veton Surroi, a member of the ethnic 
Albanian negotiating team in Kosovo, says the strikes wouldn't give 
the KLA _ which has no known command structure _ a real advantage 
against the Serbs. ``Anything that hurts Milosevic helps everybody 
else,'' he acknowledged, but ``the question is, help it do what? The 
KLA doesn't have the force to create a substantially different situation 
here.''
