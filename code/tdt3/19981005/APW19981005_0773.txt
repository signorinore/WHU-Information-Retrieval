Trying to end a four-year deadlock, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency 
resumed talks with North Korea Monday on permission to verify how 
much plutonium the country has in hand. North Korea put a halt to 
inspections of its nuclear facilities in 1994, said Hans-Friedrich 
Meyer, spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency. The North 
Koreans were upset after agency officials told the U.N. Security Council 
that the country hadn't given an accurate accounting of its nuclear 
facilities and fissionable material. IAEA inspections that began in 
1992, ``detected that there must be more plutonium,'' than the country 
had declared, Meyer said. North Korean officials refused to answer 
questions on how much nuclear material was in the country and where 
it was stored, and broke off cooperation with the IAEA. Since that 
time, talks have been held twice a year to try to resume cooperation. 
But the situation looks unlikely to improve any time soon. ``There 
is no indication of any surprise outcome,'' Meyer said. ``One can 
only hope.''
