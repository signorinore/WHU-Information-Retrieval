It's as if Roy Hobbs stepped right out of the film ``The Natural'' 
and into the New York Yankees' clubhouse. Shane Spencer has heard 
that sort of talk and laughs it off. ``Roy Hobbs was a movie,'' he 
said. ``This is real life.'' And Spencer knows all about that. The 
rookie slugger needed nine years to become an overnight success. That's 
how it goes for 28th-round draft picks. Now, at age 26, it has all 
come together for the outfielder. He hit 10 home runs in 67 at-bats 
during the regular season and three grand slams in 10 days. He homered 
in his first postseason at-bat against Texas, becoming the 27th player 
in major league history to do that and the first Yankee to do so since 
Elston Howard in 1955. Then he hit a three-run shot among claps of 
thunder in the first-round clincher against the Rangers. The homer 
in Texas was followed by a thunder storm. ``You could feel it get 
cold,'' Spencer said. ``It was kind of weird.'' Spencer was an afterthought 
in the 1990 draft. But he was built like a hitter and scouts liked 
his compact swing, so they took a shot. The youngster drifted through 
the farm system, putting together ordinary seasons at Tampa, Greensboro, 
Oneonta and Norwich. The highlight may have come one year in Greensboro, 
North Carolina when Mickey Mantle breezed through the clubhouse and 
was introduced to Spencer. ``There was a glow about him,'' the rookie 
remembered. By last season, Spencer had graduated to Columbus, the 
Yankees' Triple-A affiliate in Ohio, where he hit 30 homers and 34 
doubles, extra base numbers that attracted attention in New York. 
When Chili Davis hurt his leg the first week of the season, the Yankees 
summoned Spencer. ``My first time up, I got a taste of it and I was 
excited to be here,'' he said. ``After that, I was disappointed when 
I didn't stay.'' Spencer spent the summer on the Yankees' shuttle 
to Columbus, up and down four times in roster shuffles. In between 
the call-ups, he put together his best season, batting .322 with 18 
home runs and 67 RBIs in 87 games. By the end of August, with the 
Yankees tidying up their roster for the postseason, general manager 
Brian Cashman did a little manipulating, promoting first baseman Scott 
Seabol, placing him on the disabled list and using the flexibility 
created by the DL move to activate Spencer. ``I never thought about 
the postseason,'' Spencer said. ``I just wanted a chance to play in 
September, maybe open some eyes for next year.'' He certainly accomplished 
that, hitting eight homers in the month, a Yankees rookie record. 
During the home run record chase, the Yankee Stadium scoreboard posted 
updates on three sluggers _ Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Spencer. 
The grand slam spree impressed manager Joe Torre, who needed 17 years 
to hit three of them, something Spencer did in less than two weeks. 
Only seven Yankees have done that. The list includes Lou Gehrig, Joe 
DiMaggio and Babe Ruth. ``He spent eight years in the minor leagues,'' 
Torre said. ``That's probably more frightening than trying to produce 
in the postseason. It's an opportunity he's taking advantage of, not 
only to help us win now but to put him right in the mix for next year.''
