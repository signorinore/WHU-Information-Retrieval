France's Mary Pierce routed Amanda Coetzer 6-2, 6-2 on Monday to kick 
off the Porsche Grand Prix. But the match just set the stage for the 
real battle at the dlrs 450,000 event _ the question of who will be 
the world's No. 1 player next week. Pierce next faces Lindsay Davenport, 
the second-ranked American who could lose that second-round match 
and still end Hingis' long reign as the world's top-ranked player. 
In fact, Davenport seems more likely to finish the event as No. 1 
than Hingis amidst a tough field where 18 of the world's Top players 
20 players are entered. Hingis, the defending champion, must reach 
the final or be automatically be bumped from the top by her tall American 
rival. And the Swiss teenager has a tough draw, where her three matches 
to the final could find her slugging it out against Russia's Anna 
Kournikova, Venus Williams and world No. 3 Jana Novotna. Davenport 
would also advance to No. 1 if she wins two matches and Hingis loses 
the final, or if she reaches the final herself. Pierce, ranked 11th 
in the world, needed just 65 minutes to oust Coetzer, the No. 10. 
Lisa Raymond of the United States outlasted Romania's Ruxandra Dragomir, 
3-6, 6-2, 6-4 in the only other match. Neither Coetzer or Pierce, 
despite their high rankings, were among the eight seeds since the 
only Top 10 player missing is Monica Seles. Seles refuses to play 
in Germany since she was stabbed in Hamburg in 1993.
