Mike Tyson lost another battle on Monday to keep his psychological 
reports from being made public. A judge rejected a request for a stay 
pending an appeal to the Nevada Supreme Court. The decision left the 
former heavyweight champion with only the option of a direct appeal 
to the Supreme Court. That would almost certainly delay a tentative 
Oct. 19 hearing in which Tyson will try to regain his boxing license. 
Tyson's lawyers are trying to decide whether to give up the fight 
to keep the records private and go ahead with the Oct. 19 date. An 
early hearing date is important if Tyson is to fight this year as 
planned, if he gets his license. ``It doesn't look real good for them 
for an appeal to the Supreme court so they just might have to face 
the music and release the reports,'' said Kirk Hendrick, a deputy 
attorney general for the Nevada Athletic Commission. The same judge 
who rejected Tyson's effort last week to keep the reports of psychiatrists 
who examined the former heavyweight champion for five days last month 
turned down today's effort for a stay that would keep them private 
pending an appeal to the Supreme Court. Tyson's lawyers indicated 
after last week's ruling that they would release the reports despite 
their potential to embarrass the boxer. Tyson adviser Shelly Finkel 
said today he believes the report from doctors at Massachusetts General 
Hospital in Boston will be good enough to show Tyson if fit to fight. 
``I don't think there's anything to hide,'' Finkel said. ``But if 
you were going to go through five days of questioning from psychiatrists, 
I don't think you would want all your answers made public.'' Nevada 
commissioners have said they want at least four working days to review 
the reports before the hearing, meaning they would have to be given 
to the commission by next Monday for an Oct. 19 hearing. Commissioners 
demanded the reports following a hearing last month in which they 
said they were not satisfied with the limited psychological testing 
done on Tyson since he bit Evander Holyfield's ears and was stripped 
of his license to box.
