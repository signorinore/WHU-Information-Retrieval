The United Nations is investigating some members of the U.N. peacekeeping 
force in Cyprus for allegedly selling huge amounts of duty-free liquor 
and cigarettes illegally, U.N. officials said Monday. The officials 
wouldn't say how many people were targeted, but indicated most were 
from Ireland. Also unclear was how much illegal goods were sold, though 
a U.N. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was a 
large amount. U.N. troops are allowed to buy a certain amount of liquor 
and cigarettes at duty-free, subsidized prices around the world. Duty-free 
prices in Cyprus are generally less than half the market price. U.N. 
officials wouldn't say where the peacekeepers bought the goods or 
where they were sold. A formal report is expected within days, said 
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard. Punishment could include being shipped 
back home, said the U.N. official who spoke of condition of anonymity. 
Cyprus has been divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion sparked by an 
abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. A breakaway Turkish 
Cypriot state in the north is recognized only by Turkey. The 2,500-member 
U.N. peacekeeping force patrols the division between the two sides.
