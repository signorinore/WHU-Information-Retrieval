Secretary-General Kofi Annan reported Monday that Yugoslav forces 
increased their attacks on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians after a U.N. 
resolution demanded a cease-fire and that special police units are 
still on the ground. In a widely anticipated report to the Security 
Council, Annan listed apparent violations of a Sept. 23 U.N. resolution 
but said he couldn't give an independent assessment of whether Serb 
forces had complied with the council's demands. NATO countries had 
been awaiting the U.N. chief's report to determine whether to use 
military force to stop the offensive on ethnic Albanians who are seeking 
independence from Yugoslavia. Despite Annan's unwillingness to declare 
Serb noncompliance, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and the United 
States proclaimed he had said enough in reporting that Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic still had special units on the ground and hadn't 
allowed an estimated 275,000 refugees to return to their homes. Starkly 
laying out Yugoslavia's repressive actions, ``the secretary-general 
detailed the failure of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia authorities 
to comply,'' with the Sept. 23 resolution, U.S. Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright said in a statement.
