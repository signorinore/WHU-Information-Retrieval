As U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's left for another round 
of Mideast mediation, Israeli and the Palestinian leaders both said 
they would not make concessions unless the other side did. Albright 
was to make a two-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas in 
the hope of closing the gap between the two sides on the terms of 
a second Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank. The United States 
hoped to close the deal at a tripartite summit of President Clinton, 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat in Washington. Netanyahu said Monday there would be no agreement 
unless the Palestinian Authority carried out its commitment to clamp 
down on Islamic militants opposed to the peace process. ``If they 
(the Palestinians) honor their part, there will be an agreement. If 
they do not, we will not make unilateral concessions,'' Netanyahu 
told an audience of Christian supporters of Israel in Jerusalem. The 
Palestinians say even diligent efforts cannot provide total protection 
against attacks on Israel by Islamic militants. A top Palestinian 
official said without Israeli concessions, Albright's latest peace 
efforts ``won't go anywhere.'' Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, 
speaking to Associated Press Television News in the West Bank town 
of Jericho, also accused the Clinton administration of allowing Israel 
to drag its feet on living up to past accords. ``I hope Madame Albright 
will end this cycle _ meeting and arranging other meetings, giving 
(Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu the extra miles _ because 
this must stop and we must move to substance,'' he told APTN. ``We 
believe that without a clear-cut Netanyahu `yes' to the American initiative 
and all its components, I think we won't go anywhere,'' Erekat said. 
The Palestinians earlier this year accepted terms of an American-authored 
plan for an Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank, but Netanyahu 
balked, citing security concerns. Talks in the United States last 
week apparently brought the two sides closer together, however. Albright 
was to meet Tuesday _ separately _ with Netanyahu and Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat. Her visit is meant to lay the groundwork for 
the Israeli-Palestinian summit in Washington sometime around Oct. 
15. Albright was to spend only two days in the region, but was accompanied 
by mediator Dennis Ross, who will likely stay longer to try to coax 
the two sides as close to an accord as possible before any summit. 
On Monday's holiday, the Palestinian lands remained sealed off, as 
they have been for much of the time since a series of Jewish holidays 
beginning with the New Year on Sept. 20. The latest closure, which 
was imposed on Friday, will remain in force at least until Saturday, 
the army said Monday. In imposing the closure, Israel cited security 
threats from the radical Islamic group Hamas, which threatened revenge 
after two of its top members were slain last month by Israeli troops 
who raided their West Bank hideout. Hamas has killed dozens of Israelis 
in suicide bombings since 1994. Three pistol shots were fired at Israeli 
soldiers Monday in the divided West Bank city of Hebron, but nobody 
was hurt. An officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the 
shots were fired from the Palestinian-controlled part of the city. 
In the Gaza Strip, about 500 people staged a rally to demand the release 
of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual 
leader of Hamas, attended, but did not address the crowd.
