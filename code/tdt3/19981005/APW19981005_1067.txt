Boxing promoter Don King's company lost a Supreme Court appeal Monday 
in an insurance fraud case that prosecutors have decided not to pursue. 
Don King Productions had asked the high court to hear its argument 
that King's testimony in a 1995 insurance fraud trial should not be 
used against the company. The high court turned down the company's 
appeal without comment. The 1995 trial ended in a hung jury. In the 
second trial that ended last July, King was acquitted of all charges 
while the jury was unable to reach a verdict on charges against his 
company. Prosecutors said they will not seek a retrial of the company. 
King was accused of altering a contract with a fighter to cheat Lloyd's 
of London out of dlrs 350,000. He had taken out an insurance policy 
with Lloyd's in case a 1991 fight between Julio Cesar Chavez and Harold 
Brazier was canceled. The fight was called off when Chavez got hurt 
during training. Prosecutors said King altered his contract with Chavez 
in a way that would force Lloyd's to reimburse King for all training 
expenses and then fraudulently collected dlrs 350,000. The 1995 trial 
involved charges against King but not against his company, and the 
boxing promoter testified that the contract was altered without his 
knowledge or approval. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 
the testimony could be used against King's company in the subsequent 
trial. In appealing to the Supreme Court, lawyers for Don King Productions 
said allowing use of King's testimony would violate the company's 
right to confront the witnesses against it.
