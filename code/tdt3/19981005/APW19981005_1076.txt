Three British soldiers found guilty in 1996 of the rape and killing 
of a Danish tour guide in Cyprus have dropped efforts to overturn 
their conviction, their lawyer announced Monday. Instead, defense 
lawyers will argue that the island's supreme court should reduce the 
men's life sentence on the grounds that it is ''excessively harsh,'' 
lawyer Antonis Andreou told the British Press Association. ''We decided 
it would be more beneficial if we concentrated on the issue of sentencing 
since we were not able to overrule the abduction, conspiracy to abduct 
and attempted rape charges,'' he said. The three _ Justin Fowler, 
30, from Falmouth, Alan Ford, 29, from Birmingham, and Geoffrey Pernell, 
27, of Oldbury, West Midlands _ were convicted of kidnapping 23-year-old 
Louise Jensen in 1994 outside a night spot in the tourist resort of 
Ayia Napa. Prosecutors said the men then raped her and beat her to 
death with a shovel. The three admitted during the trial that they 
kidnapped the tour guide. But they claimed they were too drunk to 
remember details and tried to blame each other. They were sentenced 
to life in prison without remission. Defense lawyers had hoped to 
persuade the court to overturn the convictions on the grounds that 
the soldiers were arrested illegally and the lower court erred during 
the trial, but the lawyers changed tactics after an appeal hearing 
Monday, the Press Association said. The hearing is scheduled to continue 
on Wednesday. At the time of their arrest, the men were serving with 
the Royal Greenjackets Regiment at a British military base on the 
island. They were discharged after their conviction.
