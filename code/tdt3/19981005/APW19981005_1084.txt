After a lengthy absence, the LPGA tour will return to Texas next year 
with a tournament honoring Harvey Penick, the local teaching pro whose 
students included some of the game's best players _ both men and women. 
The 72-hole, dlrs 800,000 tournament will be played at Austin's Onion 
Creek Club, the course which played host to the first Legends of Golf 
and helped give birth to the men's Senior PGA Tour. Penick, who died 
in 1995, ``was one of the true pioneers, one of the truly important 
figures, not just in golf but in all of women's sports,'' said LPGA 
commissioner Jim Ritts. ``Harvey taught almost half of the players 
in the LPGA Hall of Fame. He was among the first to recognize that 
women could play golf and play well at all levels.'' As pro at Austin 
Country Club, Penick's pupils included two-time Masters champion Ben 
Crenshaw; U.S. Open winner Tom Kite; Kathy Whitworth, winner of 88 
tournaments; Mickey Wright; and Betsy Rawls. The new tournament, called 
the Philips Invitational Honoring Harvey Penick, will be held May 
20-23 and televised by CBS. The winner will take home dlrs 120,000, 
Ritts said. The LPGA has played an annual Skins Game at Frisco, Texas, 
for most of the 1990s, and the 1991 U.S. Women's Open was held at 
Fort Worth's Colonial Country Club. But the last full-field LPGA tournament 
in Texas was the Mazda Hall of Fame Championship, played at Sugar 
Land, in 1985 and 1986. Ritts, a native Texan, said he wasn't sure 
why it has been so long since the women played a tournament in the 
state. ``There was absolutely no doubt in my mind. I strongly believed 
in the state of Texas as a home for women's golf,'' he said. ``I know 
the players are going to be hungry to play in Texas. It's been a long 
time since we've been here,'' said Cindy Figg-Currier, a 15-year LPGA 
pro and Austin resident.
