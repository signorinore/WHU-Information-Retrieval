Turkey's and Syria's neighbors sought Monday to mediate a crisis that 
they feared could engulf the Middle East in war, while Turkey said 
its armed forces were ready to act against Syria should diplomacy 
fail. Turkey accuses Syria of sheltering Kurdish rebels, allowing 
them to keep battling Turkey from cross-border bases after largely 
being neutralized on their home turf. ``We don't a war with Syria, 
we want it to cut its support to Turkish Kurdish rebels and extradite 
their leaders to Turkey for trial,'' Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz told 
private Star television late Monday. ``Syria has been at least 10 
years late in doing that,'' he said. ``If it further delays it, then 
it will be the side which will get harmed.'' Yilmaz said that Syria 
has been waging an undeclared war against Turkey for decades through 
its support to the rebels and thus Turkey has the right to self-defense 
according to the 51st article of the charter of the United Nations. 
Syria on Monday called for a dialogue to end the crisis. ``Syria knows 
how to defend its interests,'' the National Progressive Front, a high-level 
advisory body to the government, said. The front is controlled by 
the ruling Baath Party. ``The language of threats is not suitable 
to deal among states. The language of dialogue is the only one that 
can solve all the remaining problems,'' the front said. Earlier in 
the day, the military and President Suleyman Demirel also stressed 
that Turkey was seeking peace not war. ``We are a country that loves 
peace,'' said Gen. Ilhan Kilic, chief of the air force. ``But we do 
not let our national interests get harmed.'' Demirel and, 5th graf
