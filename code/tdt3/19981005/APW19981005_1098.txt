Israelis on Monday celebrated the Jewish holiday of Sukkot with festive 
meals served up in hut-like structures built on urban balconies and 
suburban backyards. Despite fears of terror attacks, the day passed 
almost without incident, with the Palestinian lands remaining sealed 
off. In the divided West Bank town of Hebron, where there had been 
clashes on the previous five days, three pistol shots were fired Monday 
at Israeli soldiers, but nobody was hurt. An Israeli officer, speaking 
on condition of anonymity, said the shots came from the Palestinian-controlled 
part of the city. Sukkot, or the Feast of the Tabernacles, is one 
of the more joyous holidays on the Jewish calendar. Many Israelis, 
both religious and secular, build a sukkah, or hut, of materials ranging 
from wood and palm branches to prefab metal and plastic. The huts 
are meant to commemorate ancient Israelites' wanderings in the desert. 
Religious Jews sleep and pray in theirs; the more secular mainly use 
the structures for hearty celebratory meals in keeping with Sukkot's 
tradition as a harvest festival. The holiday also has strong traditional 
associations with nature, and Israelis headed in droves to the country's 
beaches and national parks. Tour buses backed up by the dozens at 
the crossing point into Egypt's Sinai peninsula, and hiking tours 
were fully booked. The festival lasts a week, but the main day of 
commemoration was from sundown Sunday to sundown Monday, when shops, 
offices, restaurants and schools were closed. Hours at many establishments 
were to be curtailed all week. As it has during other recent holidays, 
Israel sealed off the Palestinian lands and imposed tight security. 
The closure has been in effect, with some brief interruptions, since 
just before the start of the Jewish New Year on Sept. 20. On Monday 
the army announced that it would remain in force at least until Saturday. 
Last month, the radical Islamic group Hamas threatened revenge attacks 
and kidnappings of soldiers during the holiday season. The threat 
came after Israeli troops killed two top Hamas fugitives in their 
West Bank hideout.
