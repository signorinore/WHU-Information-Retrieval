As NATO officials reiterated their readiness for a military campaign 
in the restive Serbian province of Kosovo, European Union nations 
were divided Monday on whether to launch airstrikes without U.N. Security 
Council backing. The EU foreign ministers agreed to tighten economic 
sanctions against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end the 
violence in Kosovo. It was unlikely, however, that stricter travel 
curbs for Yugoslav officials and freezing more Yugoslav assets abroad 
would be anything more than symbolic. International appeals for a 
peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis have been repeatedly been ignored 
in the federal Yugoslav capital of Belgrade to the point that the 
United States is pressing its allies for airstrikes. The threats have 
had at least a temporary effect on Milosevic, whose offensive is designed 
to repress sentiment among the majority ethnic Albanians in Kosovo 
province to break away from Yugoslavia, which is composed of Serbia 
and the smaller republic of Montenegro. Milosevic has ordered most 
of his Serb army units back to their barracks, withdrawn police units 
and apparently ordered a halt to the burning of villages. Some 250,000 
people remain homeless, with winter approaching. The Europeans are 
wavering, however, wondering about the wisdom of NATO attacking a 
sovereign nation without a specific nod from the United Nations. The 
EU foreign ministers did, however, debate tighter travel restrictions 
on Yugoslav officials and extending a freeze on Serbian assets abroad 
to cover state-owned companies, such as the national airline JAT. 
The EU has sought to punish Yugoslavia for its crackdown against ethnic 
Albanian separatists in Kosovo through an investment ban, an assets 
freeze, visa restrictions, a ban on arms exports and flights by Yugoslav 
air carriers to EU points. In Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Javier 
Solana stressed the alliance was ready to launch a military attack. 
``The reality coming to us is that the compliance is not yet in place,'' 
Solana said in reaction to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's statement 
that he lacked the means to verify if Milosevic had complied with 
U.N. demands to end the crackdown. French Foreign Minister Hubert 
Vedrine said his government would first have to ``evaluate all the 
elements of the situation.'' He suggested that could take two days. 
Britain is Washington's staunchest ally in pursuing airstrikes without 
the U.N.'s blessing and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook was at pains 
to get European support for that here. ``Milosevic must change his 
conduct. We are determined to send him a very clear message and we 
are working determinedly with the international community to make 
sure that we are all united in sending him a very clear message,'' 
Cook said. But Manfred Hoyer, Germany's Deputy Foreign Minister, cautioned, 
``It is far too early to talk about military action. This is going 
too far.'' Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said for NATO 
to attack a sovereign nation ``requires a very strong legal basis.'' 
Unless the U.N. provides that, he said, there was a danger of ``generalized 
war'' in the Balkans. Lamberto Dini, the Italian foreign minister, 
told reporters, ``We must negotiate. It is too early to talk about 
military intervention.'' The Dutch and the Belgians also said they 
want a U.N. mandate.
