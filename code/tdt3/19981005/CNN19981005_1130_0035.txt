A judge today accepted the guilty but mentally ill plea from a Kentucky 
teenager accused of killing three classmates and wounding five others. 
Michael Carneal, who is 15, is charged as an adult in last December's 
shootings of members of a prayer circle at Heath high school in west 
Paducah. The judge accepted the plea, on condition that the maximum 
penalty of life in prison without possibility of parole for 25 years 
be imposed. A sentencing date is scheduled for December 16th.
