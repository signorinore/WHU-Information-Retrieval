A bipartisan battle is shaping up on Capitol Hill, where members of 
the house Judiciary committee are meeting today. The 37-member panel 
is expected to approve a resolution, calling for an impeachment inquiry 
into President Clinton's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky matter. Democrats 
are pushing for a resolution limiting the timetable and the scope 
of the proceedings. But the committee has a republican majority, one 
expected to pass an open-ended inquiry. Today, it's our responsibility 
and our constitutional duty to review those materials referred to 
us and recommend to the House of Representatives whether the matter 
merits a further inquiry. Let me be clear about this. We are not here 
today to decide whether or not to impeach Mr. Clinton. We are not 
here to pass judgment on anyone. We are here to ask and answer this 
one simple question -- based upon what we now know, do we have a duty 
to look further or to look away? Impeachment is a constitutional remedy, 
addressed to serious offenses against the system of government, and 
it is directed that constitutional wrongs that subvert the structure 
of government or undermine the integrity of office and even the constitution, 
itself. Those words are as true today as they were in 1974. An impeachment 
is only for a serious abuse of official power or a serious breach 
of official duties.
