If the house votes for an impeachment inquiry, a central question 
will be -- what is an impeachable offense? Charles Bierbauer reports, 
it's not an easy question to answer. The framers of the constitution 
made it quite clear -- treason and bribery would be impeachable offenses. 
They also made it murky. So would "high crimes and misdemeanors." 
We don't know what the framers meant by "high crimes and misdemeanors," 
and the best that we have come up with is that it means a political 
crime. a president's offense, then, need not be criminal. You can 
think of some things that a president or judge might do that might 
not be strictly illegal, but might rise to the level of an impeachable 
offense. Conducting a private war. Or perhaps lying to the Senate 
in the course of trying to get ratification of a treaty. On the one 
hand, that sets no bounds. On the other, that requires behavior so 
egregious it cannot be overlooked. Richard Nixon's Watergate transgressions 
fit the Bill. And as the impeachment process in the house built toward 
an inevitable conclusion, Nixon resigned. But the founding fathers 
also set a high threshold for conviction -- two-thirds of the Senate. 
It's never been reached. Andrew Johnson remained in office in 1868 
when the Senate fell one vote short. And Johnson was saved because 
just enough senators crossed party lines to vote their conscience 
in what was otherwise a political dispute. In the nation's history, 
only seven officials -- all federal judges -- have been both impeached 
and convicted. The impeachment process was not designed to be essentially 
punitive. It was designed to restore the constitutional balance that 
was somehow thrown out of whack, thrown seriously out of whack, by 
some high-ranking public official's abuse of power. That may be why 
an impeached and convicted official is not thrown in jail. The constitution 
requires only removal from office. It gives the Senate the option 
of also barring a convicted official from holding further office.
