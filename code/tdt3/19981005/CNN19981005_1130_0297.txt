The Supreme Court is starting to Wade through its next batch of cases. 
It opened its fall term today. The high court has already accepted 
46 cases on matters ranging from sexual harassment to immigration 
and deportation. The sexual harassment case will determine whether 
schools can be held liable for conduct between students. The court 
also will hear arguments over the constitutionality of a Chicago city 
ordinance police are using to keep gang members off the streets. Legal 
experts say the court's docket is full of key issues, but few that 
attract wide public interest.
