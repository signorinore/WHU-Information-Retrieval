President Clinton will speak this evening to a gathering of the world's 
financial leaders about the growing global economic crisis. Yesterday, 
federal reserve chairman Alan Greenspan met with the leaders, who 
are in Washington for G-7 and international monetary fund meetings. 
IMF officials say the global economic outlook has worsened considerably. 
But there are no clear signs members have resolved differences on 
how to deal with the crisis. President Clinton has proposed accelerating 
emergency IMF loans to countries threatened by investor panic.
