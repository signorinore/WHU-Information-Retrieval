U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke is going to Belgrade today to 
tell Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic he must comply with U.N. 
demands to stop Serbian attacks on ethnic Albanians. Earlier, Holbrooke 
met with top NATO officials in Brussels. He says the level of fighting 
in Kosovo has lessened, but he says it could easily flare up again. 
The United States has warned NAto planes will strike Serbian targets 
within two weeks unless Milosevic complies with the U.N. Yugoslavia 
has placed its defenses on high alert and is vowing to defend itself 
against any attack.
