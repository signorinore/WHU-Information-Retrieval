Secretary of state Madeleine Albright arrives in Israel tomorrow to 
prepare for a possible Washington summit between Israeli and Palestinian 
leaders. Albright will meet with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 
who says the Palestinians have not done enough to discourage terrorism. 
Israel has offered to withdraw troops from 13% of the West Bank, in 
exchange for more stringent Palestinian security measures.
