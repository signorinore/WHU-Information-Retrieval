Power flashes! Tornado on the ground! Look at it! People in central 
and eastern Oklahoma are cleaning up after several toornadoes that 
swirled across the region yesterday. Authorities in Prague say at 
least 13 people were injured. About 10,000 people still don't have 
power. That's down from 35,000 at the peak of the storm. Dozens of 
homes were damaged in the region. Roads were flooded out in Kay and 
Noble counties, including a part of I-35. Flash flood warnings have 
been issued for 13 counties and many towns have canceled school for 
the day.
