I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "Headline News weather." Temperatures 
today quite cool through the Rockies. In the Denver area, temperatures 
only in the 40s, as will be the case over much of Wyoming. In contrast, 
still warm over much of Texas and back into the southeast with highs 
in the 80s and 90s. Your forecast weather maps later today on into 
Tuesday, most of the wet weather right through the midwest. We'll 
find strong storms along that front today, back through the southern 
plains and moving into the southern Mississippi river valley as we 
head on through the day tomorrow. High pressure and fair weather will 
continue in the northeast as well as much of the west. The extended 
forecast -- showers and storms continue in the southeast during the 
day on Wednesday, extending back through the Great Lakes. Temperatures 
remain cool through the northern lakes, still warm in the southwest. 
On Thursday, the threat for rain best in the southeast back through 
the Great Lakes as temperatures remain cool in the northern Great 
Lakes. And as we head into the day on Friday, more rain from the Great 
Lakes into the northeast. Showers and storms will be moving off the 
eastern seaboard. For more weather information, including four-day 
forecasts for 6,100 cities, log into CNN.com.
