It's starting to look like it's that time of year when people from 
all walks of life converge in San Francisco for the blessing of the 
animals. God bless you. Whether they be four-legged and furred or 
winged or feathered, it was a time for creatures great -- and small 
to receive a blessing. We ask you to bless these animals. The ninth 
annual blessing of the animals on the feast of St. Francis, the patron 
Saint of animals and the patron Saint of San Francisco. It's something 
that I fell was appropriate. We are in the city of St. Francis. Most 
were family pets. But some were beasts of Burden of the uniformed 
kind. If they're healthy, then we stay healthy on horseback. Father 
is blessing him to be safe at work. a day for some natural-born adversaries 
to stop all the fussing. They really become, as St. Francis says, 
brothers and sisters to one another. No fights, and no one gets angry. 
And, in fact, they sort of discover each other. Discover they did. 
Each owner with their own reason for the blessing. He does bad things 
once in a while and we want him to be forgiven. What do you think 
the blessing will do for him? Help him be a better cat. We're all 
family. We're supposed to live in harmony with each other. And as 
humans, we're stewards and we should be humble stewards of these animals. 
God bless. Blessings some hope will carry forth from the animal world, 
making this one a little more human. Rusty Dornin, CNN, San Francisco.
