a stroke, or brain attack, occurs when an artery leading to the brain 
becomes blocked or ruptures, cutting off the oxygen supply. Strokes 
damage parts of the brain, suddenly limiting victims' mental and physical 
functions. Stroke is the third-leading killer in the United States. 
Warning signs include -- I want you to squeeze my fingers real hard. 
While these attacks occur suddenly, most often they're years in the 
making. The major cause is high blood pressure. Have yours checked 
often. Eat healthy and avoid cholesterol and fats. If you have diabetes, 
keep it under control. Don't smoke. And ask your doctor about taking 
a daily preventive dose of aspirin. Studies have shown it helps prevent 
strokes. For "your health," Judy Fortin, "Headline News."
