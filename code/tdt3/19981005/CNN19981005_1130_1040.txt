Boston chicken has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The 
fast-food chain is closing 178 stores, or 16% of its nearly 1,150 
restaurants. The company, based in Colorado, says it has received 
a commitment from a group of lenders to help it continue operations. 
Meanwhile, 18,000 employees will be transferred. That's nearly all 
the workers from the closed stores.
