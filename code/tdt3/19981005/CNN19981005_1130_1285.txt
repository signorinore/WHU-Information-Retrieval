Sunday in the NFL -- a sloppy field led to some sloppy football with 
the chiefs 17-6 win over Seattle. Rich gannon atoned for three lost 
fumbles by running for a td and throwing for an 80-yard bomb to Andre 
Rison. Rob Johnson threw for 254 yards, as the bills pick up their 
first win of the season, 26-21, over the previously unbeaten 49ers. 
The dolphins picked up their first loss of the year, falling to the 
jets 20-9. Curtis Martin ran for 108 yards and one score. John Elway 
had better watch out. Bubby brister is 2-0 as a starter, after throwing 
for four scores in Denver's 41-16 Rout of the Eagles. Atlanta's 3-1 
after a 51-21 Rout of Carolina. The falcons put three TDs on the board 
in a 48 second span.
