Designer Oscar De La renta's fall collection is out. Elsa Klensch 
has a look. Subtle luxury. For the fall/winter season, New York designer 
Oscar De La renta says it's his driving force. There's richness and 
a modern sense of romance, but it's played down. De la renta likes 
less pattern and more pizazz. But it's a pizazz that comes as much 
from the woman herself as it does from the clothes he designs. You 
are dealing with a woman who is far much more sure of herself, of 
the image that she projects and sells as an individual. Her sense 
of individuality is the most important thing to this woman. And you 
know she doesn't want to be remarked by how she dresses, you know, 
she wants to be remarked for who she is. De La renta tells me proportion 
is the key to this collection. And for fall and winter, proportion 
is dictated by lengths. Lengths, in a way, change all the proportions 
of how clothes should be worn, and how they should be used. I think 
anything that is below the knee, and then down, down, down looks great. 
There is a new sense of, you know, an emergence of a quieter sense 
of luxury. You know, where we are really working with beautiful cashmeres, 
which might be as expensive as an embroidered dress or double face 
cashmeres, and the whole sense of texture and the workmanship to the 
clothes. I think that creates sort of a whole new sense of how one 
should dress. Oscar, are coats important? Coats are important, absolutely. 
I'm showing a few, but only looks good either longer or mid-calf. 
The colors of the collection? For day I have used a lot of greys and 
navies and olive colors and black. And then for evening, obviously 
anything goes. Obviously night, black is an important color, but then 
there's a lot of other colors, you know. And I have a strapless, very 
simple long evening dress, red satin, that looks great and feminine 
and sexy. What about knits? How important are knits today? I think 
knits are important because it's part of this easiness and fluidity. 
Remember when you wear a long skirt you need something that moves 
well, or something that stretches, because otherwise it doesn't really 
make sense. You should never at any point walk in an uncomfortable 
manner. Makeup and hair? Makeup is very simple, easy. I just always 
want the girls to look very pretty, but I love the idea of a very 
red lip. The hair is just very, very, very simple. I like the face 
sort of clear, but I like to see hair in the back. That's Oscar De 
La renta with his fall/winter collection. Elsa Klensch, CNN, New York.
