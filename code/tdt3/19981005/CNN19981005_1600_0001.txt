The chief investigator for the republicans outlined what he called 
evidence of 15 impeachable offenses. That goes beyond the Starr report 
which said the president may have committed 11. But the top democratic 
investigator disagreed, saying none of the offenses rise to the level 
of impeachment. The process thus far is backwards. The committee is 
considering whether to open what type of actual impeachment inquiry 
without having spent a single minute discussing what conduct of a 
president rises to an impeachable offense. This, members of the committee, 
is the equivalent of a ship's captain leaving on a difficult and uncharted 
voyage, hoping to find his or her compass somewhere along the way. 
If lying under oath is tolerated, and when exposed is not visited 
with immediate and substantial adverse consequences the integrity 
of this country's entire judicial process is fatally compromised and 
that process will inevitably collapse. The Judiciary committee opened 
the debate this morning with a series of opening statements. Members 
often invoked the founding fathers to lay out their positions. The 
men who gathered in Philadelphia 211 years ago to solidify the constitution, 
the young soldiers who bled to death on foreign shores to protect 
it, the prosecutors who put their lives on the line to force its laws, 
every teacher who has lead her class in reciting the pledge of allegiance, 
could anyone look into the faces of those people and tell them it 
really doesn't matter that the president abused his power, lied to 
the American people, perjured himself and subverted the rule of law? 
Anyone who can answer yes to that question does not have the right 
to sit here today. The president has an affair. He lied about it. 
He didn't want anyone to know about it. Does anyone reasonably believe 
that this amounts to subversion of government? Does anyone reasonably 
believe that this is what the founding fathers were talking about? 
For more than 200 years since that convention in Philadelphia, Congress 
has never, never removed a president from office. Is this where we 
want to set the bar for future presidents? I plead with this committee 
to end this nonsense.
