As the Judiciary committee considers his future, President Clinton 
is carrying on with business as usual today. He'll meet world finance 
ministers in a little more than an hour from now and outline his plan 
to stem the global economic crisis. Members of the international monetary 
fund are meeting in Washington this week and warn the situation is 
growing worse. But they can't agree on what to do. President Clinton 
wants Congress to help by giving the IMF more money. We must act to 
protect our prosperity in this turbulent international economy. By 
meeting our obligations to the international monetary fund. The world 
is waiting, literally the world is waiting. For Congress to step up 
to America's responsibility, provide funds to the IMF and give us 
to tools we need to pull teeters economies back from the brink and 
to keep America's economic prosperity going. It would be unacceptable 
for Congress to leave Washington before acting.
