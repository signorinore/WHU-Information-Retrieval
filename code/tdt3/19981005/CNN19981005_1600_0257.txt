A judge in Paducah, Kentucky, today accepted the "guilty, but mentally 
ill" plea of a 15-year-old boy accused of killing three classmates 
and wounding five others. Michael Carneal will be sentenced on December 
16th. Authorities say Carneal opened fire on schoolmates attending 
a preschool prayer session last December. Under his plea arrangement, 
Carneal must serve at least 25 years in prison without the possibility 
of parole. I think that we had a strong case. I also think that the 
family apparently did not want to put themselves and these victims 
that witnessed this through a trial. We met with all those witnesses, 
and I can't tell you how many of these kids cried when they related 
to us what happened. I think Carneal's pleading guilty -- I think 
they deserve credit for that. The plea agreement calls for Carneal 
to get psychiatric treatment within the prison system.
