In a report to the U.N. security council, Kofi Annan finds Yugoslav 
forces responsible for most of the recent atrocities in Kosovo. The 
U.N. secretary general also says attacks on ethnic Albanians by the 
mostly Serb forces increased after the U.N. passed a resolution demanding 
a cease fire. U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke is meeting today 
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. On his way to meet Milosevic, 
Holbrooke stopped at NAto headquarters to review plans for a possible 
intervention in Kosovo.
