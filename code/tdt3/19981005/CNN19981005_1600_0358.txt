China signed a key human rights treaty today at the United Nations. 
The international treaty guarantees freedom of expression and religion, 
a fair trial and protection against torture and arbitrary arrest. 
The U.N. high commissioner for human rights welcomed the signing, 
but said it would take more than just words to prevent abuses.
