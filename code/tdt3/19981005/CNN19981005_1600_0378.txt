Power flashes! Tornado on the ground! Look at it! People in central 
and eastern Oklahoma are cleaning up after several tornadoes that 
swirled across the region yesterday. Authorities say at least 18 people 
were injured. About 10,000 people still don't have power. That's down 
from 35,000 at the peak of the storm. Dozens of homes were damaged 
in the region. Roads were flooded out in Kay and Noble counties, including 
a part of I-35. Flash flood warnings have been issued for 13 counties 
and many towns canceled school for the day.
