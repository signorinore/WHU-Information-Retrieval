An area of low pressure will continue moving across the northern plains, 
dropping rain and snow across the Rockies. A cold front system will 
be moving across the eastern U.S. and Texas, bringing in cooler temperatures, 
but not before strong thunderstorms head across the region and into 
the deep south. Rainfall will be decreasing across portions of the 
west and a high pressure Ridge will be building in, but a cold front 
system moving into the pacific northwest could mean rainfall increasing 
on Wednesday. High temperatures will be in the 50s and 60s for most 
of the west. You'll see 70s and 80s across the deep south and across 
portions of the southwest. The extended forecast continues a chance 
of strong thunderstorms moving eastward on Wednesday, with rain across 
the Great Lakes. A few showers will change into heavier rain on Thursday 
in the pacific northwest, as the eastern storm continues to March 
across the Great Lakes. By Friday, just look for rainfall across the 
Great Lakes and New England, with scattered showers and thunderstorms 
in the south.
