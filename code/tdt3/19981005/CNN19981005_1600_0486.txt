A new survey suggests the time is right for taking on the problem 
of teenage drinking. The survey by the Robert wood Johnson foundation 
found 96% of Americans are concerned about teen drinking. One expert 
says moving the drinking age back to 21 has helped but more action 
is needed. When that policy went up to 21, even with pretty modest 
or low levels of enforcement, it had a substantial public health benefit, 
and it reduced young people's involvement in problems like traffic 
crashes by about 15%. Well, that's not solving the problem, but when 
you have a solution, a public policy solution that can reduce the 
leading cause of death among young people by 15%, translated that 
means 1,000 young people a year are not dying now, that otherwise 
would have died. 82% of those questioned in the study are willing 
to pay a nickel tax on alcoholic drinks if the proceeds go to programs 
to prevent minors from drinking.
