It's that time of the year again when people from all walks of life 
converge in San Francisco for the annual blessing of the animals. 
Rusty Dornin reports. God bless you. Whether they be four-legged and 
furred -- or winged or feathered, it was a time for creatures great 
and small to receive a blessing. We ask you now to bless these animals. 
The ninth annual blessing of the animals on the feast of St. Francis, 
the patron Saint of animals and the patron Saint of San Francisco. 
It's something that I felt was appropriate. We are in the city of 
St. Francis. Most were family pets. But some were beasts of Burden 
of the uniformed kind. Because if they're healthy, we stay healthy 
on horseback. He's been blessed by the father to stay safe at work. 
a day for some natural-born adversaries to stop all the fussing. They 
really become, as St. Francis says, brothers and sisters to one another. 
And no fights, no one gets angry. And, in fact, they sort of discover 
each other. Discover they did. And each owner had their own reasons 
for the blessing. He does bad things once in a while, and we want 
him to be forgiven. What do you think the blessing does for him? Help 
him be a better cat. We're all family, and we should live in harmony 
with each other. And if we're anything as humans, we're stewards. 
But we should be humble stewards of these animals. God bless. Blessings 
some hope will carry forth from the animal world, making this one 
a little more human. Rusty Dornin, CNN, San Francisco.
