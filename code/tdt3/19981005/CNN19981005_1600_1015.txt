An airline alliance pays off double for passengers of a shuttle service. 
U.S. airways and American airlines say they're both giving northeast 
shuttle service passengers frequent-flyer miles for a single flight. 
Customers taking U.S. air's shuttle connecting New York to Boston 
and Washington can now earn miles on the frequent-flyer programs of 
both companies. So instead of the 500 miles passengers used to get, 
they can now earn a total of 1,000.
