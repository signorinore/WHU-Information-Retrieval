that's "Dollars & Sense," Judy. Thanks, bev. Like to thri those. Sports 
is next. Boundaries. From the very beginning... we have resented them. 
So what happens? Some of us grow up to be business people and what 
do we face? More boundaries! The telecommunications boundaries that 
separate local from long distance, voice from data, domestic from 
global. And force you to accept separate carriers, separate networks, 
a blizzard of bills. Ah, but these is a way through those barriers. 
Right through... here. The port of entry to a seamless global network 
that lets you have one carrier, one contact, one Bill. And makes it 
seem as though the old boundaries no longer exist. Because for you, 
they won't. On-net. From MCI Worldcom. Jerome Jurenovich, "Headline 
Sports."
