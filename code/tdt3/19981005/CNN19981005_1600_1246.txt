Monday night football features a pair of 4-0 teams in the black-and-blue 
division. The Vikings are in green bay to play the Packers. This is 
a big game. I think everybody in this locker room and everybody in 
their locker room knows that. And this is a game that we have to win, 
a game they have to win. And the thing is, is that we need to just 
keep playing like we've been playing. We do that, and we eliminate 
some mistakes, we dominate anybody.
