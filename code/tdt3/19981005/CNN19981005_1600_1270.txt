The Yankees and Indians are getting ready for the start of the American 
league championship series tomorrow in New York. Jaret Wright is expected 
to start for Cleveland against David Wells. I think the key to any 
game is go out there and get ahead in the count. And I think that's 
what we proved with Texas. We went out there, we threw strikes and 
made things happen. The national league championship series begins 
on Wednesday, with Atlanta hosting San Diego. It's the padres' first 
appearance in the alcs since 1984. While the Braves are after their 
fifth world series appearance in the last eight years. Jerome Jurenovich, 
"Headline Sports."
