What started as a single collaboration between two songwriters of 
different eras has resulted in a new album with a unique sound. Mark 
Scheerer reports. There could never be a happy ending The song is 
"God give me strength." And that sounds like what some might have 
said upon learning that pop composer extraordinaire Burt bacharach 
and one-time angry young postpunk-rocker Elvis Costello were teaming 
up. They wrote this song for the 1997 film "grace of my heart," and 
then decided to do a whole album. It's called "painted from memory." 
Is it "what the world needs now" -- or a reminder that "accidents 
will happen"? I mean, we weren't saying, like we're going to sit down 
and we're going to try to write a song like, "remember Elvis, in 1973? 
That one song that I did with dionne?" No, nothing like that. I think 
if anything resonates, it's just using the strengths of the orchestra. 
I mean, I'm the singer. We've written the music together. I've written 
the lyrics. So Burt's instrument on the record is not just the piano, 
but the whole orchestra. You know, he plays the music through the 
orchestra. For bacharach, it's another curl in the wave of Burt mania 
-- young bands like the Ben folds five and oasis singing his praises, 
his music turning up in "my best friend's wedding" and "Austin powers." 
Call his stuff elevator music? He doesn't care. There was a cartoon 
once that I saw or was sent to me, three guys waiting for elevators. 
One elevator was listed "mancini," the other was "manilow" and the 
other was "bacharach." So, I thought, "you know, that's very flattering." 
For Costello, the snarling, staggering presence in 1978's "pump it 
up," "painted from memory" continues his career curve toward crooner, 
but he'll tell you that's nothing new. I've always thought of myself 
as a ballad singer who could sing rock 'N' roll, not the other way 
around. These rooms play tricks upon you remember when they were always 
filled with laughter but now they're quite deserted they seem to just 
echo voices raised in anger maybe you will see my FRIEND "what's so 
funny about peace, love and understanding?" Or a Burt and Elvis collaboration? 
Anyone who had a heart will tell you what "painted from memory" is 
all about. Mark Scheerer, "CNN Entertainment News," New York.
