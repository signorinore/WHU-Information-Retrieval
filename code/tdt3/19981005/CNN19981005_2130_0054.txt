world financial leaders are continuing their meetings in washington 
tonight as they search for a plan of action to address the world's 
financial situation. after more than two days of meetings, no concrete 
proposals have been agreed upon. president clinton addressed the evening 
session. he is proposing providing $18 billion to the international 
monetary fund to aid countries with economies in the most danger. 
so far, congress has failed to approve his request. the way we move 
forward using our work here tonight, will help to determine the course 
of our children's future. we must do whatever it takes to build them 
a future of stable and sustained progress and limitless opportunity. 
i am convinced that as formidable as the challenge may seem, it is 
well within our grasp if we determine to do what it takes.
