the white house is asking the supreme court to hear an appeal over 
attorney/client privilege in the monica lewinksy case. a lower court 
ruled the president's conversations with government attorneys are 
not protected. the white house now claims independent counsel ken 
starr misled the lower court when he argued that impeachment was too 
remote a possibility to consider as the court reviewed white house 
arguments on the use of attorney/client privilege.
