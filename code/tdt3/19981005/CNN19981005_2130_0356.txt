democratic leaders are trying to shift congress' attention towards 
the federal budget. today, the president, house minority leader richard 
gephart and senate minority leader tom daschle urged congress to pass 
long-stalled government spending bills. they contend congress has 
sent the president just two of 13 bills for the fiscal year that began 
last week. and a resolution funding the government at 1998 levels 
expires friday. republicans say they suspect democrats are trying 
to cause another government shutdown, but they deny that.
