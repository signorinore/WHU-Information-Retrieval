the united states says there are signs serb troops are pulling back 
in the yugoslav province of kosovo, but adds president slobodan milosevic 
is not doing enough to avert nato air strikes. u.s. mediator richard 
holbrooke is trying to persuade milosevic to comply with u.n. resolutions 
regarding troop withdrawal. nato could decide on wednesday whether 
to launch air strikes on serb military targets. that decision will 
have to be taken by the political authorities of the 16 nato nations, 
based on the evidence that is in front of them at the time they meet 
to decide that. that day is not far off unless we see what would have 
to be a strategic and definitive and irreversible change on a part 
of the serb authorities attitude and behavior.
