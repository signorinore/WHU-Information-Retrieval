the supreme court opened its new term today with several rulings. 
in two notable decisions, the court upheld a new york city zoning 
law used to prohibit topless dancing. the justices rejected claims 
the 1995 ordinance discriminated against female dancers and stifled 
erotic expression. and they said an indiana school district may continue 
random drug testing of students who take part in extra-curricular 
activities. several parents challenged the tests saying they were 
an invasion of privacy.
