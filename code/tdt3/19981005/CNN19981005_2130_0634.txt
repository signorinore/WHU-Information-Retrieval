it appears dangerous bacteria and criminals have something in common. 
a set of fingerprints. ann kellan checks out the latest technology 
to keep your food safe in "tech trends." during a period of hot weather 
last june in suburban atlanta, there was a major e. coli outbreak. 
e. coli is a bacteria normally found in all of us but certain strains 
such as 0157:h7 carry a toxin. georgia public health officials traced 
the organism to this popular water park. health officials also relied 
on a cutting-edge technology called pfge, or pulsed field gel electrophoresis. 
it provides a way to figure out if different samples of e. coli are 
related through a genetic fingerprint. that genetic fingerprint separated 
the water park cases from all the other e. coli cases the health department 
was dealing with. with the use of pfge we were able to see that the 
cases that did not go to the water park in fact were different. here's 
how pfge works. the e. coli bacteria from victims of an outbreak are 
cultured to increase their numbers. the bacteria's dna is then chemically 
cut into small pieces. this dna is processed so the pieces are separated 
on the basis of size. a fluorescent dye makes the dna glow under ultraviolet 
light, so the dna pattern of each sample can be seen, and compared. 
if you look at the e. coli cases from the water park -- this is one 
from a patient that was involved in our water park outbreak. and this 
is another patient. and you can see they match exactly, they're all 
connected. the centers for disease control has set up a database of 
fingerprints called pulsenet that could help public health officials 
all over the u.s. identify and deal with outbreaks more quickly. the 
pfge test is only available in about seven or eight states right now, 
but may become more widely available as this technology proves its 
usefulness to public health. ann kellan, cnn.
