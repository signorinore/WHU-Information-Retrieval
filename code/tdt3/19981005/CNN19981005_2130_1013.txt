knowing when to take a vacation can make a big difference in how much 
the trip costs you and even how much fun you might have. kalin thomas-samuel 
has advice in this edition of "working ahead." most travelers vacation 
during peak season when the weather's great and everything's open 
-- but prices are high. budget travelers often make plans for the 
off-season. but the time in between? welcome to the "shoulder season," 
which some travel experts say is the smartest travel time. shoulder 
season is a really good time to go to vacation destinations and -- 
and other popular places around the world because you avoid the crowds 
and the high prices of peak season, but you still have the good weather 
and the conditions that are perfect for whatever activity you want 
to do. the trick is pinpointing when shoulder seasons fall. once you 
have your destination, guidebooks or the internet can tell you peak 
months for visits and crowds. hotel rates also offer clues. for example, 
in new york city, if you travel the third week of december, most of 
the hotels slash their rates. also other cities, such as washington, 
d.c., if you're traveling after mid-november the rates go way down. 
the end of a holiday period can signal the beginning of shoulder season. 
so find out what the school season is and the vacation times for the 
country you're going to and then avoid those times. you know when 
all the locals have gone home that's when you'll have the beach to 
yourself. the travel industry kind of breathes a sigh of relief, and 
there are a lot more rooms available. and everyone is a little bit 
more friendly and accommodating. but don't expect to find shoulder 
seasons in places such as orlando and las vegas, where conventions 
keep cities busy year-round. kalin thomas-samuel, cnn, reporting.
