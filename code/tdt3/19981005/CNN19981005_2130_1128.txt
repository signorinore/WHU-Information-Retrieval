two nfl unbeatens collide -- next in "headline sports." they are the 
most environmentally vulnerable of all living things. to commit to 
their future is to commit to ours. southern company, america's largest 
generator of electricity, is planting 20 million trees and pioneering 
the use of electric vehicles all in a commitment to cleaner air. so, 
as they take flight into the future, we'll be down here helping to 
keep the environment clean and the power on. we are southern company. 
energy to serve your world. boundaries. from the very beginning... 
we have resented them. so what happens ? some of us grow up to be 
business people and what do we face ? more boundaries! the telecommunications 
boundaries that separate local from long distance, voice from data, 
domestic from global. and force you to accept separate carriers, separate 
networks, a blizzard of bills. ah, but these is a way through those 
barriers. right through... here. the port of entry to a seamless global 
network that lets you have one carrier, one contact, one bill. and 
makes it seem as though the old boundaries no longer exist. because 
for you, they won't. on-net. from mci worldcom.
