I'm Pat O'Brien filling in for Keith olbermann who is out covering 
the New York Yankees. We are here to ask and answer this O simple 
question. Based upon what we now know, do we have a duty to look further 
or to look away? This is not Watergate, it is an extramarital affair. 
Tonight the house Judiciary committee has voted to send the matter 
to the full house. Their recommendation, a formal impeachment process 
should get under way. Now all eyes on the next vote. At the White 
House, the staff, the president and on down try to make it appear 
that it's business as usual while their future is being decided across 
town. And the continuing concerns about Wall Street, world markets, 
and recession, a rough day of trading and wild predickes about what 
the future may hold. Good Monday effect to you.
