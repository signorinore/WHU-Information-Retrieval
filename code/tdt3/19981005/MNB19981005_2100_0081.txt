The Judiciary committee of the House of Representatives has voted. 
It happened tonight. They transmitted their recommendation that the 
full house now approve and begin a formal impeachment proceeding in 
the investigation of this president. The 42nd president, Bill Clinton 
is a step closer tonight to have the third American president to have 
an impeachment mechanism activated for full removal from office. The 
White House is saying they can't be bothered by this but at some level 
they can't help but be bothered by this. The president spent the evening 
at a political party event. The next vote in the house may amount 
to a referendum on his presidency.
