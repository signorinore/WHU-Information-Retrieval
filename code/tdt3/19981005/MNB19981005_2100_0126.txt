We'll begin tonight with a late report on tonight's vote. Here is 
Gwen ifil on Capitol Hill tonight. The house Judiciary committee voted 
tonight to take an historic first step toward removing President Clinton 
from office. The 21-16 vote fell strictly along party lines. Democrats 
are losing their fight to limit the inquiry. We are going to move 
as swiftly as human hands and feet and mind can do it because nobody 
wants this to be stretched out. Earlier in the day, lead republican 
investigator David schippers argued for an expansion of the inquiry. 
15 separate events directly involving President William Jefferson 
Clinton that could -- could constitute felonies. According to schippers, 
the lies began January 17, that's the day President Clinton testifying 
in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case was surprised to be asked 
about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. During the next 48 hours, 
schippers said, the White House launched into frantic, perhaps spir 
to recall damage control including 22 phone calls from presidential 
confidante Vernon Jordan to the White House. 11 times Betty Currie 
paged Monica Lewinsky. And nine more phone calls and White House visits 
involved Jordan, Lewinsky, and Francis Carter who became Lewinsky's 
lawyer. The laws of this country are the great barriers that protect 
the citizens from the wounds of evil and tyranny. If we permit one 
of those laws to fall, who will be able to stand in the winds that 
follow? Democrats argued angrily the president may have lied but he 
didn't do anything that would rise to impeachment. The president had 
an affair. He lied about it. He didn't want anybody to know about 
it. Does anybody reasonableably believe this amounts to subversion 
of government? The question is not if the statements were or were 
not truthful, but what were their context and impact. This is not 
Watergate, it is an extramarital affair. Even scholars debate how 
to define an impeachment offense. Liing to a grand jury is not a terrible 
thing but it is not abuse of presidential power. Both sides are passsionate 
about one thing, they want the issue resolved by the end of the year. 
This is the third time in history Congress has come this close to 
impeaching the sitting president. And while the White House votes 
to continue the impeachment hearings this week, Gwen Ifill, NBC news, 
the capitol.
