we'll talk about the impacts of a form president, Gerald Ford has 
broken his silence in a public way about what should happen to the

got a surprise for you. When the night has come and the land is dark 
and the Moon is the only light you see darling, darling child: isn't 
it a good surprise? Stand by me lesabre by Buick. Peace of mind. Stand
