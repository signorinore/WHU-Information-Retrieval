Congressman Rothman, the next question to you after a break. It was 
the merger of the two largest railroads in America. And it touched 
everyone... to unite the atlantic and the pacific... for when the 
last Spike was driven into the last tie... America was officially 
open for business. ...the east and west have come together... and 
now... it's happening again. A new and critical link has been forged. 
...a worldwide network... two of the largest networks on earth have 
just become one. With capacity so vast, it can carry all the data 
traffic of all the other carriers combined to more places around the 
world than any other network. Introducing MCI Worldcom. Now the world 
is officially open for business.
