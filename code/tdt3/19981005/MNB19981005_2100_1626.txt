Time to look at the weather across the country and we go to WNBC in 
New York to Janice huff. We have woes across the country as a vigorous 
and slow-moving storm system has created a variety of weather across 
central portion of the country. One has been a blizzard from the south 
hills of South Dakota. Wind gusts of 70 miles per hour and up to a 
foot of snow and interstate 80 has been closed for blizzard-like conditions. 
Where the temperatures are warm, 80's and 70's, a lot of humidity, 
severe weather has been occurring as well as tornados in Oklahoma 
City last night. In the communities, lots of tornados. Some people 
still without power. There was no school today in many communities. 
A lot of it is shifting slowly to the east. There have been problems 
with flooding in Missouri today. The east coast is dry as well as 
the west. Temperatures are pleasant over California today. Tonight, 
lows in the 20's and 30's across the central portion of the Rockies 
in the inner mountain region. You can see where the contrast is along 
that line is where the severe weather is breaking out. Highs in the 
80's over southern California. Look at Los Angeles, 83, 95 in Phoenix 
with sunshine. The central portion of the country, more showers. Dallas 
cools off finally with a high of 67 degrees compared to the 90's in 
the last several weeks.
