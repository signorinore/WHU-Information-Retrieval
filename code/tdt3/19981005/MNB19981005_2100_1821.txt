In the investigation of the current president, there's a call for 
a compromise from the man who became president back when Richard Nixon 
resigned, Gerald Ford. The 38th president has broken his silence on 
the subject of the 42nd president. And Ford, in Sunday's "New York 
Times," called for a punishment short of impeachment. He wants to 
sacrifice partisan politics for the sake of the office. The majesty 
of the office, he says, has been missing. That story from Lisa Myers. 
On the eve of today's historic debate, Gerald Ford broke with some 
in his own party urging Congress to short circuit the impeachment 
process and instead harshly rebuke President Clinton for wrongdoing. 
In his first statement, Ford wrote he has no interest in rescuing 
Bill Clinton who has broken faith with the American people. But he 
did say, I do passionately about rescuing the country I love. An absolute 
pardon on to Richard Nixon. 22 years ago, Ford cited similar concerns 
for pardoning Nixon on Watergate. Does President Ford view this as 
a pardon of sorts for President Clinton? Yes, in effect. He felt it 
was right to pardon President Nixon, former President Nixon, so, now, 
he feels it is right to dispose of this matter quickly, to rebuke, 
to issue a rebuke of this president, and then get on with the business 
of the government. Under Ford's plan, the Judiciary committee would 
finish its inquiry by the end of the year. Then Congress would summon 
the president to the house where he would be harshly reprimanded by 
both parties. In all, now three former presidents have criticized 
Mr. Clinton's conduct. My own opinion is that the president has not 
been truthle. Today neither bush nor Carter would comment on Ford's 
suggestion and some historians view the conduct is not grave enough 
to grant impeachment but more serious than they admit. He was using 
the presidential authority that demeaned the presidency. As for the 
president, he praised his idea but Ford says the president must admit 
guilt but he must.
