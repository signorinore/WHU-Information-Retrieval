Tonight from the studios of CNBC, we're joined by Ron Insana who watched 
it all unfold as he does each day on the air. What's going on out 
there today? A lot of disappointment on Wall Street becomes more and 
more evident. Today there was disappointment that the G-7 nations, 
the industrialized countries that met in Washington to talk about 
the economic global pry sis didn't do anything about it. They're worried 
about the president's political position. We shoumed note where the 
Dow has been over the past 12 months. It's been as high as 9337 back 
on July 17. And as low most recently as 7400 in the middle of the 
day on September 1. the NASDAQ having a tougher time. It fell sharply 
today. The fifth biggest point decline ever. Worry about the high-tech 
companies problems there. Big stocks, big financial companies coming 
under pressure. There are worries there could be more troubles in 
the hedge fund community and the firms that lend to them like the 
banks and brokers. The good news about all of this is that long-term 
interest rates keep falling. Dramatically, the yield on the 30-year 
bond, the benchmark bond down to 4.7. people looking for a safe place 
to park their money.
