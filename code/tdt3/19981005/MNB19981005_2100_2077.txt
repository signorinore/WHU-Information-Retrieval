We established that the president's problems are having an effect 
on domestic markets and perhaps on world economies if not politics. 
But what about the world market the way Wall Street sees them? Are 
some of them beyond the point of no return? If you look at Indonesia 
and Malaysia and to an extent Hong Kong, down from 60% from its all-time 
high. There's a great deal of worry that not a single country or combrupe 
of countries is -- group of countries doing enough to turn the situation 
around. The president's situation is what's going on around the world, 
weak leadership. That's true not just in the United States but almost 
everywhere in the major industrialized countries now.
