Officials say tonight the pilot of an air tanker that crashed earlier 
while fighting a wild fire in southern California is presumed dead 
now. The fire started this morning 100 miles east of Los Angeles. 
It's fueled by dry, gusty winds this time of year. 600 people were 
evacuated from banning, California. Other brush fires have erupted 
and are still burning tonight in the area.
