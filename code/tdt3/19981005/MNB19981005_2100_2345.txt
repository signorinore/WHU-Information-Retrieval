Only one little girl lost her entire family but that story focused 
a lot of attention. Her story tonight from Ron Allen in Kosovo. She 
is the lucky one, 6 weeks old, the only survivor of a brutal massacre 
of old men and women here. The little girl was saved while Serb soldiers 
shot, and stabbed the other members. She was protected by her mother's 
dying body. Her grandfather's plea to the outside, we need help to 
stop the massacres and perhaps now the plea is herd to start action. 
Allies are now poised to launch an attack. Warplanes remain on high 
alert. NAto officials insisting the Serbs have refused to withdraw 
thousands of throops from Kosovo. Under threat, some Serb military 
unions are pulling back. But the Serbs still vow to protect their 
territory which is why some human rights activists fear more brutality. 
I don't think it's over. I think we're seeing a moment -- temporary 
reprieve. Caught in the middle, more than 300,000 refugees now camped 
in the forests for months hoping NAto will finally come to the rescue. 
We're surrounded by Serbs, she says, without protection, we'll die. 
No one here feels safe. Just a few days ago, Serb helicopters dropped 
these lefflets from the sky warning everyone to surrender their weapons 
and return home. They're afraid the Serbs will attack them here. More 
evidence of the horrors. The bodies of two teenage girls discovered 
in thick brush. One 13, the other 15 both missing for a week. As for 
the baby, she can sleep easy while those hiding her remain afraid.
