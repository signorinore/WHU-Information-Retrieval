Time is money even for good samaritans. One man did something really 
good and wanted something really good in return. A doctor who treated 
a seriously ill passenger onboard an American airlines flight last 
year. He's going to court to get his just reward. Keith Miller filed 
this report for "today" on NBC. Takeoff. ( scientific atl It was ATLANTA 
flight 136 bound a medical emergency onboard. And I remember feeling 
terribly ill and I remember telling my daughter I felt ill. And then 
I don't remember anything. The in-flight call for a doctor was answered 
by a psychiatrist, John Stevens. She was quite seriously ill. She 
had chest pains, shortness of breath, she looked Gray. While the pilot 
deverted the flight to Chicago, Dr. Stevens stayed with the patient. 
He didn't leave my side. Her heart was treated in the hospital but 
Audrey Stevens said the doctor saved her life. American airlines gave 
him a no-name champagne and a $50 flight coupon. It had restrictions 
on it. So he billed the airlines $900 for his service. The airline 
refused to play calling it outrageous. He said this is no different 
than a doctor helping someone at the shopping mall and you don't Bill 
a shopping mall. The doctor is suing. Lawyers here think Dr. Stevens 
may win it. You could argue it as a point of law but if I were arguing 
I would say, this is one that doesn't need to go to a full spat. Why 
can't we sort it out like grown-UPS? You're a psychiatrist. Have you 
evaluated your ownself? Have you thought through what motivates you? 
I'm average linares cystic. But still mentally healthy. As mentally 
healthy as any psychiatrist can be. It's the principal says Dr. Stevens, 
not the money. Everything has a price. According to the Bible, the 
good samaritan was prepared to accept his reward in heaven rather 
than on earth. It seems nowadays in our consumerist world, good samaritans 
aren't prepared to wait that long. The case may give new meaning to 
call, is there a doctor in the house, or the plane. Keith Miller, 
NBC news. London.
