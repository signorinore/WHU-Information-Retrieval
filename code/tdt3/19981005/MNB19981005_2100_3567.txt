A reminder, up next on MSNBC, an hour-long report on the debate anchored 
by John Hockenberry. That is our broadcast. We hope to see you back 
here at the same time tomorrow night for the Tuesday edition. I'm 
Brian williamsment for all of us here, good night, everybody. THING. 
Part of this vote tomorrow is about allowing Congress to say, Mr. 
president, one more thing. And here's the ultimate mystery -- we don't 
know what that one more thing is. And better yet, we don't even know 
if there is one more thing. But tomorrow, we will find out if we care. 
And one more thing, as Joe Friday of "dragnet" used to say, just the 
facts, ma'am. Wouldn't that be nice? "the news with Brian Williams" 
is next. I'm Pat O'Brien.
