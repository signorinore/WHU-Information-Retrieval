Tonight -- the historic debate -- should President Clinton be impeached? 
This will be an emotional process, a strenuous process. A bitter split 
over the next step. I plead with this committee to end this nonsense. 
The future of the Clinton presidency. The world money crisis -- getting 
worse, hitting Americans harder. "In depth" -- "living longer, living 
better" -- millions survive a stroke but never fully recover. Now, 
a bold experiment to repair the damage. And -- like John gle, older 
Americans who want to live their dream do. They have "the right stuff."
