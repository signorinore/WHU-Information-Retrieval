Good evening. It is under way, the great constitutional debate of 
whether this president should be the target of an impeachment investigation 
in the House of Representatives. Although the beginning of the debate 
in the house Judiciary committee was couched in language invoking 
the constitution and the American people, it quickly became, once 
again, a highly partisan debate. We began tonight with NBC's Gwen 
Ifill. Good evening, Tom. Republican lawmakers arguing that the president 
lied and obstructed justice, took the first steps toward removing 
him from office. For Judiciary committee chairman Henry Hyde, the 
day's challenge was clear. We are here to ask and answer this one 
simple question -- based upon what we now know, do we have a duty 
to look further or to look away? But Hyde's hand-picked investigator, 
a Chicago prosecutor and longtime democrat, David schippers, argued 
for an expansion of the inquiry. 15 separate events directly involving 
President William Jefferson Clinton that could constitute felonies. 
According to schippers, the lies began January 17th that's the day 
Mr. Clinton, testifying in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case, 
was surprised to be asked about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
During the next 48 hours, schippers said, the White House launched 
into frantic, perhaps conspiratorial, damage control, including -- 
Democrats concede the president may have lied, but argue he did nothing 
that rises to the level of impeachment. The president had an affair. 
He lied about it. He didn't want anyone to know about it. Does anybody 
reasonably believe that this amounts to subversion of government? 
The inquiry is not on whether his statements were or were not truthful, 
but what were their context, what were their impact? Even constitutional 
scholars debate what constitutes an impeachable offense. Lying to 
a grand jury is a terrible thing, but it's not necessarily an abuse 
of presidential power. Both sides are passionate on one point -- they 
want the issue resolved by the end of the year. This is only the third 
time in history Congress has come this close to impeaching a president. 
And when the full house votes later this week. tom?
