Today's debate took place against the backdrop of a major statement 
on the scandal from a former president, Gerald Ford. Ford, who ascended 
to the presidency when Richard Nixon was forced to resign during Watergate, 
called for something less than impeachment. NBC's Lisa Myers tonight 
on the Ford factor. On the eve of today's historic debate, former 
President Ford broke with some in his own party, urging Congress to 
short-circuit the impeachment process and, instead, harshly and publicly 
rebuke President Clinton for wrongdoing. In his first statement on 
the issue, Ford wrote he has no interest in "rescuing Bill Clinton," 
who has "broken faith" with the American people. "But," he said -- 
An absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon. 24 years ago, Ford cited similar 
concerns in pardoning former President Nixon for crimes during Watergate. 
James Cannon was with Ford then and advises him now. Does President 
Ford view this as a pardon of sorts for Bill Clinton? Yes, in effect. 
As he felt it was right to pardon President Nixon, so now he feels 
it is right to dispose of this matter quickly, to issue a rebuke of 
this president and then get on with the business of the government. 
Under Ford's plan, the Judiciary committee would finish its inquiry 
by the end of the year. Then, Congress would summon the president 
to the well of the house, where he'd be harshly reprimanded by both 
parties. In all now, three former president's have criticized Mr. 
Clinton's conduct. My opinion is that the president has not been truthful. 
Today, neither former President Carter or bush would comment on Ford's 
suggestion. But Carter predicts Clinton will not be removed from office. 
And Ford's idea resonates with some historians, who view the president's 
misconduct as not grave enough to warrant impeachment, but more serious 
than the White House admits. When he chose to lie to the American 
people, he was using the presidential authority in a way that really 
demeaned the dignity of the office of the presidency. As for the president, 
his spokesman praised Ford's idea but did not say whether Mr. Clinton 
would be willing to admit guilt and accept a rebuke, which Ford says 
he must to end "an otherwise squalid year." Lisa Myers, NBC news, 
Washington.
