While Capitol Hill debated impeachment, President Clinton was focused 
on the economy here at home and overseas. The president met tonight 
with top officials of 22 countries, gathered in Washington, to try 
to figure out how to stop the growing financial crisis that the president 
calls the worst threat to economic security in 50 years. The roots 
of the problem began in Asia and though Japan's economy has been battered 
for months now. There are new signs tonight that the financial situation 
may be about to get a lot worse. What does that mean for us here at 
home? Here's NBC's George Lewis. At this airstrip in the Arizona desert, 
best known as a graveyard for old aircraft, a dozen brand-new 747 
jumbo jets sit idle, put there by the Boeing company because the troubled 
Asian airlines which purchased the planes have canceled the orders. 
In long beach, California, huge container ships bound for Asia leave 
port as much as 60% empty. The reason, Asia is buying fewer products 
made in the USA. It's the same story at the port of Seattle, where 
many of the loading cranes sit idle. We are worried in Washington 
and sleepless in Seattle for a reason. At the heart of the financial 
crisis in Asia, a breakdown of the banking system in Japan. Amid reports 
that Japan's top 19 banks are in deep financial trouble, U.S. treasury 
secretary Robert Rubin met with Japanese officials this weekend, but 
got only a vague description of Japan's troubles. Officials say the 
Japanese do admit there has been, "A substantial erosion of reserves," 
at Japan's top banks. While the U.S. economy is chugging along, largely 
unaffected so far by the Asian crisis, experts say there are plenty 
of warning signs pointing to trouble down the road. Steven roach is 
the chief economist for Morgan Stanley dean witter. We have a crisis 
brewing the world economy and world financial markets, the likes of 
which most have not seen in our professional careers, so it would 
be frivolous to pretend that the events halfway around the world mean 
nothing. It certainly means something in the little Tokyo section 
of Los Angeles, which normally caters to Japanese tourists. Business 
this year is off 30%. In this year, it's very bad right now. Very 
bad. Bad, getting worse, and maybe even threatening to ground the 
high-flying U.S. economy. George Lewis, NBC news, Los Angeles.
