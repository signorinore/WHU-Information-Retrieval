Stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability in this 
country. What do you need to know about the danger? Some answers tonight, 
from Dr. Stanley tuhrim, head of the stroke service at mt. Sinai hospital 
in New York, "in his own words." Older people are at risk for stroke. 
African Americans are at greater risk for stroke than are white Americans. 
Anybody that has high blood pressure, diabetes or high cholesterol 
or anyone who smokes, there is an increased risk for stroke. People 
are at risk for stroke because their arteries are narrowed. The narrowing 
of the blood vessel means less blood gets to the brain. And eventually, 
the artery may be clogged, so that no blood gets to the brain. And 
that's when you get a stroke. The warning signs of the stroke include 
weakness or numbness of the arm or leg on one side of the body, difficulty 
speaking or understanding what's being said, difficulty with vision, 
either on one side of the body or double vision, or suddenly finding 
you are uncoordinated, that is walking very unsteadily. We now have 
a treatment for stoke that can only be effective within the first 
three hours after the onset of symptoms called tpa. That actually 
busts up the clot that is blocking the blood from getting to the brain. 
And by dissolving that clot, restoring blood flow to the part of the 
brain that is at risk. Dr. Stanley tuhrim of New York's Mt. Sinai 
hospital tonight, "in his own words."
