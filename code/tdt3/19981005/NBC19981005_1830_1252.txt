And in Belgrade, Yugoslavia -- U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke gave Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic a final warning, to stop his crackdown 
on ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo region or face NATO air strikes 
within days. Milosevic rebuffed saying NATO strikes would be what 
he called a criminal act. Why now? What has aroused the ire of the 
international community? Kosovo has been under fire for seven months. 
800 ethnic Albanians have died. But the world took notice when the 
pictures of a brutal massacre surfaced last week. Tonight, from Kosovo, 
NBC's Ron Allen on the only survivor and a desperate plea for help. 
She is the lucky one -- 6 weeks old, the only survivor of the brutal 
massacre of old men, women and children here that so shocked the world. 
Tiny detoria was concealed from the bloodshed while Serb soldiers 
shot, stabbed and mutilated more than a dozen members of her family. 
She was protected by her dying mother's body. The baby, now safe, 
in hiding with relatives. Her grandfather's plea to the outside world 
-- "we need help," he says, "to stop the massacres." And perhaps now 
his plea is heard as a call to action. The U.S. and its NAto allies 
now poised to launch an air attack against the Serbs. NATO warplanes 
remain on high alert. U.S. officials insisting the Serbs have refused 
to withdraw thousands of troops from Kosovo. Under threat, some Serb 
military units are finally pulling back for now, but the Serbs still 
vow to protect their territory, which is why some human rights activists 
fear even more brutality when NATO looks away. I don't think it's 
over. I think we're seeing a temporary reprieve. Caught in the middle, 
more than 300,000 terrified refugees now camping in the forests for 
months, hoping that NAto will finally come to the rescue. "We're still 
surrounded by Serbs," she says. "Without protection we'll die." No 
one in the camp feels safe. Just a few days ago, Serb helicopters 
dropped leaflets warning everyone to turn in their weapons and return 
home. These refugees fear the Serbs will attack them right here. And 
tonight, more evidence of Kosovo's horrors, the bodies of two teenage 
girls discovered in thick brush. One 13, the other 15, both missing 
more than a week. As for detoria, she can sleep easily tonight while 
those who are hiding her remain fearful. Ron Allen, NBC news, Kosovo.
