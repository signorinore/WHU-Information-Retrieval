Over the years, John Glenn has inspired a lot of people as one of 
the original astronauts, the first American to orbit earth, as a senator, 
and now as the oldest astronaut scheduled to fly in the space shuttle 
later this month. As NBC's Anne Thompson tells us tonight, John Glenn 
isn't alone in his dreams. Other older Americans have them, too, and 
they have their own way of realizing them. This is the picture that's 
launched millions of dreams. Three, two, one. And this is the middle 
of Kansas, 1,500 miles from cape Canaveral, where 33 would-be astronauts 
will come as close to that dream as you can -- in a simulator that 
doesn't leave the ground. The entire goal of this mission is to get 
on orbit and then launch a satellite. Like John Glenn, these seniors 
ranging in age from 56 to 84 are training for a space shuttle mission, 
a generation that remembers the fierce competition with the then Soviet 
Union. They watched the space race in real time. Soviet Yuri gagarin, 
going into space in this capsule. American John Glenn, in Mercury-7, 
soaring into the final frontier. More than 3 decades later, 65-year-old 
Bob deupree still wants to go. I can easily imagine myself on a shuttle. 
a passion fueled by the accomplishments of his old Navy buddy, Apollo 
astronaut Alan Bean. Bob went into medicine. Bean walked on the Moon. 
Now, Bob and his fellow campers are learning what it takes to go into 
space, experiencing the force of take off and re-entry in the centrifuge, 
two black pods spinning at 42 revolutions per minute. Not a problem 
for 83-year-old Herman noweck. That's it? That's it? Five "G"s? Oh 
geez. No kidding. The stress test. Here, the mission's in trouble, 
punching the right button means life or death. Crashed, right? Loss 
of control. Three rings spinning, twisting, turning. Former English 
teacher Karen duran on her head. You're upside down, and its hard 
to know if you're spinning or the world is spinning. All in preparation 
for a simulated shuttle mission. For an hour, it is a spectacular 
journey in the mind. The view from the shuttle has got to be a tremendous 
thing, got to be tremendous. And I would love to see that. For Bob's 
crew, the mission a success. Congratulations, commander. Thank you 
very much. Oh, that was fun. Conquering space. A dream, still drawn 
by its powerful lure. Anne Thompson, NBC news, Hutchinson, Kansas.
