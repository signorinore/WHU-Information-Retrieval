For millions of people, Prozac and similar drugs have fulfilled the 
promise of freedom from depression. But for some patients, adjusting 
to a life without misery turns out to be far more difficult than they 
imagined. Doctors and patients are discovering that recovery from 
depression can bring a new array of personal problems, from social 
uneasiness and crises of identity to professional and marital strains. 
In short, feeling happy after years of being depressed can be surprisingly 
unsettling. ``Some people feel incredibly liberated,'' said John Oldham, 
director of the New York State Psychiatric Institute. ``Others have 
a rockier time.'' Since the advent of Prozac in 1988, a spate of written 
accounts, most notably Peter Kramer's best-selling book, ``Listening 
to Prozac'' (Viking, 1993), have documented the dramatic, and joyous, 
rebirth the new antidepressants can bring. Far less well known is 
the fact that the very patients who are helped by these drugs may 
also undergo a turbulent period of adjustment in which they grapple 
with unfamiliar identities. ``The most fundamental aspect of yourself 
has been ripped away,'' said Lauren Slater, a writer and clinical 
psychologist in Boston who started taking Prozac 10 years ago for 
a crippling depression that began in childhood. The depression lifted, 
but she was left with a lingering sense of bewilderment and grief. 
``It took about two years for me to stop feeling like such a stranger 
to myself,'' Ms. Slater, who was one of the first patients to take 
Prozac, recalled in a recent interview. The phenomenon has no name, 
has never been studied clinically and has barely been described in 
popular or professional literature. But clinicians who treat depression 
know it well. ``I've had more than a few patients who have read books 
like `Prozac Nation' and `Listening to Prozac' who have come in and 
said, `You know, I'm glad for some people it was this easy, but this 
really doesn't tell my story,''' said Michael Thase, a professor of 
psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. The 
unease that can accompany relief from depression _ call it uplift 
anxiety _ manifests itself in a variety of ways. Besides grieving 
for their former selves, the newly undepressed can experience pressure 
to make up for lost time or feel ashamed of needing to take medication. 
For many, emerging from depression means having to negotiate the world 
in unaccustomed ways, as they learn to assert themselves, take social 
risks and express anger _ things depressed people typically have trouble 
doing. ``It's like being plunked down in an entirely new culture,'' 
said Ms. Slater, 35, who chronicled her experience in ``Prozac Diary,'' 
a memoir recently published by Random House. ``You have no clue how 
to speak the language, how to get around. You're a person without 
a map.'' In this respect, uplift anxiety echoes the problems that 
can accompany other radical changes of self, like those documented 
by the neurologist Oliver Sacks. In his 1973 book ``Awakenings,'' 
for example, Sacks chronicled what happened when patients ``frozen'' 
for decades by encephalitis lethargica were given the drug L-dopa. 
The patients were restored to life, but had to learn to function in 
a world that had long since passed them by. More than 65 million prescriptions 
for antidepressants were dispensed in the United States in 1997, according 
to IMS Health, an industry consulting concern. But the number of patients 
who experience uplift anxiety is not known. ``It's not a rare occurrence, 
and it's not a very frequent occurrence,'' said Maurizio Fava, an 
associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. ``I think 
it's something in between.'' Those most likely to have problems feeling 
good, clinicians say, are people who suffer from chronic depression, 
which affects roughly 3 to 4 percent of American adults. ``If all 
you can remember is depression, then there's no baseline to get back 
to,'' said John Markowitz, an associate professor of clinical psychiatry 
at Cornell Medical Center. ``There's at least been a familiarity to 
living in misery for 30 years or 40 years.'' People undoubtedly encountered 
this problem with older antidepressants, clinicians say. But the huge 
popularity of newer medications like the selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors, the class of drugs that includes Prozac, has thrown the 
issue into sharper relief. ``I don't think it was never seen in the 
past,'' said Kramer, the author and a clinical professor of psychiatry 
at Brown University. ``What creates a social phenomenon is just how 
widespread the prescribing of antidepressants is now.'' Patients and 
clinicians interviewed about the adjustment to well-being describe 
a range of reactions. ``Once you leave depression, you're back in 
the world where people have problems and have to make compromises 
and decisions and have too much to do,'' said one patient, an academic 
in her 40s at a Northeastern university who recently emerged from 
a six-year depression with the aid of Nardil, an older antidepressant. 
``And it's more of a strain to be in that world for a person who's 
had depression than it is for a person who has a normal amount of 
energy.'' The patient, who requested anonymity, likened her experience 
to that of a paroled convict slowly re-learning how to function on 
the outside. Once active on the dinner-party circuit, she said, she 
is having to teach herself how to entertain again. ``It's an effort,'' 
she said. ``You have to calculate things and figure out how much time 
it takes you. If you're taking antidepressants, you might be somewhat 
slowed down, so it might need more planning or more time to do it 
or more help.'' Some newly undepressed people feel great pressure 
to make up for the years sacrificed to illness. ``I'm haunted by lost 
time,'' said Ms. Slater, who underwent five hospitalizations for depression 
and was unable to hold a job before she began taking Prozac. ``I've 
had to work in some ways four or five times harder to catch up with 
my peers. I did my doctoral program in two years, which is insane, 
but I needed to catch up.'' Others come out of depression only to 
discover that they're stuck in jobs far below their abilities. ``While 
you're depressed, you may feel you don't deserve any better,'' said 
Fava of Harvard. But once the depression lifts, he said, ``a long 
track record of underachievement may be quite upsetting.'' Worse, 
as the undepressed begin to relate differently to those around them, 
family relationships can be compromised. Patients who emerge from 
depression, clinicians say, often separate or divorce. ``It's not 
uncommon for people to have significant marriage or partner problems 
upon recovery,'' Fava said. ``In depression, the relationship sets 
itself in a certain way, and the moment you change the balance, there's 
some sort of a reaction to it.'' For some people, uplift anxiety can 
run its course in a matter of weeks or months, clinicians say; for 
others it might take years _ if it ever abates entirely. Some patients 
unable to adjust to life without depression may furtively discontinue 
their medication, said Oldham, who stressed the importance of warning 
patients of the potential for feeling at sea. And the right kind of 
psychotherapy _ traditionally considered an important adjunct to drug 
therapy _ can help ease a difficult transition. ``What they really 
need to focus on is not what happened in their childhood, but what 
do they want to do now,'' said Markowitz, who recommends interpersonal 
psychotherapy or cognitive behavior therapy, short-term therapies 
designed to treat depression. For Ms. Slater, the benefits of Prozac 
have been indisputable. In the decade she's been on the drug, she 
has earned master's and doctoral degrees, established a career as 
the director of a community mental-health center, married happily 
and purchased a home. But there remains, she said, a palpable sense 
of bereavement. ``I still feel _ I KNOW _ that something has been 
lost,'' she said. ``And so the grief goes on, even while you get your 
bearings. I think the sense of loss is part of being a Prozac patient.''
