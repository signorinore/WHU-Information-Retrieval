``It depends on how you define alone,'' President Clinton told the 
grand jury. At another point, he said, ``It depends on what the meaning 
of the word is is.'' Some readers and viewers, including Democratic 
congressional leaders, found this ``legalistic parsing'' off-putting. 
To construe words and tenses so narrowly, they felt, was trickily 
misleading, deliberately deceptive or even perjurious. Those of us 
in the language dodge, on the other hand, were delighted to see someone 
demonstrating the glories of terminological exactitude. To millions 
of schoolchildren, the word tense meant only how you felt before a 
pop quiz. Now its grammatical sense comes into its newsworthy own 
with what is is. Asked if he had (past tense) a sexual relationship 
with Monica Lewinsky, the president replied under oath and later to 
interviewers ``there's no sexual relationship,'' with that elided 
``s''capable of being construed as is or was. Unless asked afterward, 
``Was there ever'' (past tense) or ``Has there been'' (past perfect), 
he could say that he was telling the literal truth _ that no relationship 
was taking place at that moment. The present third-person singular 
of the verb ``to be'' comes from the Latin esse, as in Bishop George 
Berkeley's esse est percipi, ``to be is to be perceived.'' It's a 
short jump from esse to is. Clinton's formulation of ``what is is'' 
lends itself to metaphysical discussions about being and essence, 
and will surely be the title of tracts about virtual reality in the 
age of image. Since so much depends on how we define alone, let's 
take a crack at it. The word is an odd combination of all and one; 
to say ``all alone'' is to be redundant. The original meaning is ``wholly 
one'' _ that is, ``unaccompanied; absolutely by oneself'' _ as in 
Shakespeare's ``Julius Caesar'' when Brutus says, ``Good countrymen, 
let me depart alone.'' A seeming oxymoron is alone together, which 
is what was asked of Clinton. In the Paula Jones deposition, he said 
he did not remember being alone with Ms Lewinsky; in his grand-jury 
testimony, he admitted nine occasions when they were together unobserved 
by others. His secretary, Betty Currie, gave the meaning a stretch 
when she said, ``the president, for all intents and purposes, is never 
alone. ... There's always somebody around him.'' In current usage 
alone with means ``unobserved by a third party.'' Euphemism entered 
the testimony at least twice, once deceptively, once in a kindly way. 
In answering a question about what a prosecutor called ``phone sex,'' 
Clinton admitted to ``inappropriate sexual banter.'' The etymology 
of banter is a mystery. Jonathan Swift, in the introduction to his 
``Tale of a Tub,'' wrote in 1710 that this bit of slang ``was first 
borrowed from the bullies in White Friars, then fell among the footmen, 
and at last retired to the pedants.'' Originally used to mean ``raillery, 
ridicule,'' it softened in time to a sense of ``good-humored teasing'' 
or ``joking dialogue, merry jesting.'' It never had, and does not 
now have, a connotation of sex talk. The gentling quality of euphemism 
came in reference to Ms Lewinsky's report of Clinton's denial of an 
affair with another White House aide. The president was quoted as 
referring to the other woman as small-breasted. A generation ago, 
the lack of an impressive bosom was often derided as flat-chested; 
the current use, as indicated in the testimony, is both more anatomically 
accurate and less cruel and pejorative. Clinton's sensitivity to the 
nuance of language was exhibited in his answer to questions about 
an episode at a White House gate in which a Secret Service officer 
revealed to Ms Lewinsky that another woman was in the Oval Office 
with the president. A prosecutor asked, ``Weren't you irate?'' The 
president responded, ``What I remember was being upset.'' Irate is 
rooted in the Latin irasci, ``to be angry,'' which also spawned ire 
and irascible. At the low end of irate's meaning is ``wrathful'' and 
at the high end is ``incensed,'' one stop short of ``enraged.'' But 
Clinton, who knew his reaction had already been the subject of testimony 
by his aides, did not want to admit to anger that could be interpreted 
as leading to a threat to fire an agent. Hence his admission only 
to being upset, from the Middle English upsetten, which originally 
meant ``toppled, overturned,'' but which in this modern extension 
of the metaphor means ``disturbed,'' more worried or annoyed than 
angered or irate. A person who is irate strikes fear into others; 
one who is upset evokes sympathy from them. The president used a similar 
term to accuse his accusers of ``trying to set me up and trick me.'' 
A prosecutor countered by asking if he thought he had the right to 
commit perjury ``because you think the case was a political case or 
a setup.'' The slang term had its origin in 1880 regarding free drinks, 
and later as the ice-and-soda fixings needing only a shot of booze 
to turn into a highball. The entrapment sense (made famous by the 
Washington Mayor Marion Barry's cry, ``the bitch set me up!'' which 
soon appeared on T-shirts in the nation's capital) appears closely 
associated with boxing. In 1926, setups were defined in Herst's International 
as ``has-beens or never-wases who get paid to stand up just long enough 
to be knocked out.'' A further development of the idea _ to make an 
opponent vulnerable to a knockout blow _ was expressed by the former 
heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey in 1950: ``If you can land solidly 
with a straight left or with a left hook, you'll generally knock your 
opponent off balance, at least, and `set him up' for a potshot with 
your right.'' The extended metaphor of this fighting image, now meaning 
``to entrap or ensnare,'' was the sense used by both witness and prosecutor 
in the historic Clinton testimony.
