To complement this fall's easy, unstructured clothing, tote bags should 
be sleek and slim. With flat heels all the rage, there is no need 
to carry extra shoes; there should be room just for papers and reading 
material _ that's the ideal, anyway. A new collection of bags by Lambertson/Truex 
is setting the style for the modern skinny tote. Its collection at 
Bergdorf Goodman is in black leather or calf hair and in leopard-patterned 
calf hair ($400 to $465). Bergdorf's also has Fendi's nylon jersey 
tote ($350). Barneys New York has flat totes in black or brown leather 
by Dries Van Noten ($525 and $550) and in its private label collection 
($295). In Henri Bendel's own collection there is a crocodile-embossed 
leather tote ($248). The store also has a leather tote by Furla ($328) 
and microfiber bags by Isabelle Fiore ($178) and Kazuyo Nakano ($228). 
Dolce &AMP; Gabbana's flat leather totes in two sizes ($455 and $510) 
are at Neiman Marcus.
