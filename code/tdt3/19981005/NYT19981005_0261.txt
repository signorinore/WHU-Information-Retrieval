John Lesnick spent much of the time from Thanksgiving 1995 to Valentine's 
Day 1996 lying flat on his bony back at Roosevelt Hospital in New 
York, confronting a royal flush of AIDS ailments _ lymphoma, mycobacterium 
avium complex, microsporidiosis and esophageal thrush. He had few 
visitors, his closest friends were already gone and zero T-cells. 
His doctor suggested stopping all medication to let nature take its 
course. It seemed that his time to die had arrived. ``At one point, 
I had dragged myself to a scale outside my room, and it said 100 pounds,'' 
recalled Lesnick, a printmaker by training. ``And that's when I sort 
of said, `Well, this is it.''' Today, Lesnick, 45, is living one of 
the success stories of protease inhibitors, the powerful anti-HIV 
compounds introduced in 1996. He is swimming again, doing volunteer 
work and making longer-term plans for the first time since he learned 
he had HIV, which causes AIDS, in 1985. The death pall has blown away. 
It is surprising, then, that Lesnick finds himself under more psychological 
stress now than ever, an emotional whipsaw that he is addressing with 
a counselor. ``On the surface it's wonderful to walk down the street, 
see myself in a store window and think, God that's me,'' he said. 
``But there's an awful lot below that surface. All my friends are 
dead. I haven't worked since 1992. I haven't had sex in six years. 
How do you begin being a human being again?'' Lesnick's doctor said 
the reaction is common. ``Now that John is feeling better, he has 
realized that AIDS has destroyed his life,'' said Dr. Howard Grossman, 
a New York AIDS specialist. ``All of my patients who have spent as 
much time struggling to survive as he has are now allowing themselves 
to be a little angry about it.'' Still, Lesnick's new future, while 
stretching further toward the horizon than he had ever expected, remains 
uncertain. He is not cured. He is simply healthier because of his 
treatment. ``He doesn't trust what's happening to him,'' Grossman 
said. In half the people taking protease inhibitors, the drugs have 
pushed HIV levels below science's ability to detect them and caused 
the body's disease-fighting T-cells to rebound. As a result, AIDS 
death figures have dropped by half, and the constellation of opportunistic 
infections like the ones Lesnick was battling just three years ago 
have tumbled by 60 percent, according to a study by the Johns Hopkins 
University in Baltimore. Despite their renewed health, many people 
with AIDS have been gripped by depression, acute anxiety _ especially 
over financial issues _ and other, unexpected emotional problems, 
clinicians and therapists said. Some patients have ended long-term 
romantic relationships and others have become suicidal, an odd response 
to being given a reprieve from death. This unique affliction has been 
called the Lazarus Syndrome after the biblical figure whom Christ 
raised from the dead, said Dr. Robert Remien, a clinical psychologist 
and researcher at the HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies 
at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Though no statistics 
are available, Dr. Judith Rabkin, a professor of clinical psychology 
at Columbia University, estimated that tens of thousands of AIDS patients 
may suffer from it. ``This can be more stressful than illness itself,'' 
Remien said. ``When you suddenly find yourself facing a much longer-term 
future, people are left with this feeling of, `What do I do now? This 
isn't what I was planning. I have to worry about retirement benefits? 
I may have to go back to work? I may have to pay off those credit 
cards?' That is tremendously traumatic and disruptive.'' Despite the 
grueling regimen of pills many AIDS patients contend with daily, Lazarus 
Syndrome is not thought to be caused by the medications per se, although 
the rigid medication schedule and side effects can contribute, said 
Benjamin Lipton, director of clinical services at Gay Men's Health 
Crisis in New York. Experts say the Lazarus Syndrome is unique to 
AIDS, with no easy parallel to other illnesses. Perhaps the closest 
comparison is to the trauma suffered by people freed from German concentration 
camps, said Dr. Linda Moneyham, a researcher at the University of 
South Carolina who is studying the phenomenon. Like many people with 
AIDS who got very sick, Holocaust survivors watched their families 
and friends die, and fully expected to follow, but instead were suddenly 
freed to a precarious and lonely world. ``It all boils down to uncertainty,'' 
Moneyham said. ``Sometimes even though the known is bad, at least 
you know what it is and you know what to do about it.'' For those 
who develop clinical depression, doctors are careful in prescribing 
antidepressants, because some interact with certain AIDS medicines. 
To address the other issues, AID Atlanta, that city's oldest AIDS 
service agency, last year designed a program to help clients cope 
with their emotions. The counseling program, called Reconstruction, 
leads patients through topics like ``Hype vs. Hope,'' and ``Wake Up 
and Smell The T-Cells'' in an effort to ease what Mark King, the program 
coordinator, called a return to the rat race. Reconstruction, which 
is offered in 10 other cities, including Kansas City, Mo., and Jersey 
City, N.J., is sponsored by a grant from Hoffman-LaRoche, one of several 
pharmaceutical companies that make protease inhibitors. ``We began 
to see more depression among these clients now than when they thought 
they were going to die,'' King said. ``They had spent years tying 
up loose ends, making that trip around the world they always dreamed 
of, planning a funeral. And in a perverse way the rug was pulled out 
from under them.'' Workshop leaders around the country are noticing 
commonalities. One surprise, King said, was a huge break-up rate among 
people whose health had rallied. ``They come to the realization, sitting 
at the breakfast table one morning, that `if I'm going to live another 
20 years, it's not going to be with you,''' he said. That is precisely 
the thought that struck Bruce Brothers, now 39, who is HIV positive 
and had lived for nine years with a man who also is HIV positive. 
``When we got diagnosed, that was the moment I knew we would die together,'' 
he said. ``We had rings that were inscribed, `Forever Bruce,' and 
`Forever Dan.''' But when protease inhibitors brought them both back 
to life, Brothers said, ``We both came to realizations together that 
in health, this was not the relationship for us.'' The two formally 
separated late last month. Lesnick, the New York printmaker, now weighs 
145 pounds, which he called ``my ideal size.'' Although he has not 
responded ideally to protease inhibitors, they have nonetheless reduced 
his viral load from a high of 280,000 to 9,000 per cubic milliliter 
of blood, while his T-cells have shot up from zero to near 65, still 
well below a normal count of more than 600. He is feeling much better. 
He has the strength now to volunteer regularly for three local AIDS 
organizations. ``Every morning I stand up and get out of bed and I'm 
thrilled,'' Lesnick said. ``But life is never back to normal.''
