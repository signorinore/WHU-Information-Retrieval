Bill Moyers and ``Frontline'' return Tuesday night to what they call 
``Washington's Other Scandal.'' You remember: That's the one about 
campaign financing, when the president entertained rich contributors 
instead of interns. This report focuses on how the 1996 Clinton campaigners 
sold ``access'' to those who could afford it. Relying on Dick Morris, 
the president's favorite political strategist turned television thinker, 
the program tells of the urgency in the Clinton camp to raise money 
for a big drive as the 1996 elections approached. In search of ways 
to get around restrictions on contributions directly to candidates, 
the Clintonians went after ``soft money'' from fat cats, purportedly 
for ``issue ads'' unrelated to the campaign. That turned out, as they 
say, to be a distinction without a difference. In a portent of rationalizations 
to come, White House advisers like Harold Ickes assured Clinton that 
the strategy met the language of the law if not its spirit. Pressed 
by Moyers, ever the theology student, on the morality of the operation, 
Ickes assures him that moral calculations did not cause any loss of 
sleep around the White House. The overriding moral guide was that 
the other side would be doing much the same thing. As for those stern 
Republican Party moralizers, who are occupied these days with issuing 
commandments for presidential behavior, they have shown little interest 
in campaign reform. Videos of gatherings for especially generous donors, 
presided over by the president, show Clinton expressing his appreciation, 
though no neckties seem to have been involved. (In the months leading 
to the 1996 campaign, by ``Frontline's'' account, 532 White House 
guests came up with $26.4 million, about $50,000 per cup of coffee.) 
``There is no cap on how much a wealthy individual can give,'' Moyers 
emphasizes. ``The lid is off.'' Noting that the president has laid 
claim to identifying with people who have ``the short end of the stick,'' 
Moyers asks Ickes in a rhetorical flourish how many constituents at 
that end ever got invitations to coffee. Since some things are prohibited 
even at the White House, no money changed hands on the premises. But 
that appears to have been a minor formality. Although most of the 
attention Tuesday night is given to the Clinton success story, Moyers 
makes plain that campaign finagling is a bipartisan activity. The 
program looks into how businessmen in quest of government favors became 
major benefactors of Republican candidates while concealing where 
the money was coming from. Moyers calls the collaboration between 
Democrats and Republicans in protecting the true sources of their 
bounties ``a mutual protection racket.'' With attention focused elsewhere 
these days, ``Washington's Other Scandal'' reminds us that it is still 
money more than the other thing that makes politics go round. BROADCAST
