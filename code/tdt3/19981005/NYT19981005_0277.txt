The award ceremony to be held on Thursday at Harvard University will 
draw more than 1,100 scientists and their students. But the occasion 
will be something less than solemn. Paper airplanes will sail from 
the stage and chants will rise from the audience as the prize-winners 
receive their awards. They will be the newest IgNobel laureates. The 
program includes an extremely brief opera on a scientific subject, 
three one-minute scientific lectures called the Heisenberg Certainty 
Lectures (with a stopwatch and a bouncer ready should the speaker 
pass the 60-second mark), and a win-a-date-with-a-Nobel-Laureate drawing. 
The IgNobel prizes, now in its seventh year, celebrate actual published 
research or other scientific activities that are, in a word, goofy. 
Past winners include Ellen Kleist of Greenland and Harald Moi of Norway 
for their disturbing medical paper, ``Transmission of Gonorrhea Through 
an Inflatable Doll''; D.M.R. Georget and colleagues of England for 
their analysis of why breakfast cereal becomes soggy; Chonosuke Okamura 
of Japan for his ``discovery'' of humans, horses and dragon fossils, 
each a complete skeleton less than one-hundredth of an inch long; 
and Robert Matthews of Aston University in England for demonstrating 
that toast does indeed fall on the buttered side. The man responsible 
for all this is Marc Abrahams, editor of Annals of Improbable Research, 
a journal sometimes referred to as the ``Mad magazine of science.'' 
It is probably the only scientific journal with seven Nobel laureates 
and a felon on its editorial board. Abrahams, 42, is a Harvard-trained 
mathematician, former computer software entrepreneur and columnist 
whose exploits as editor of the magazine are passing into legend among 
academics. He grew up in Swampscott, Mass., and after his mathematics 
and computer studies at Harvard, he developed educational programs 
to train people to be good at decision-making. On the side, though, 
he was writing science humor and eventually he submitted some work 
to The Journal of Irreproducible Results, the predecessor of the Annals. 
He could not find an address for it, so he wrote to Martin Gardner, 
a mathematician and games specialist who had written articles for 
the journal. Gardner's reply was unexpectedly enthusiastic. ``Would 
you like to be editor?'' he asked. The journal lacked an editor and 
was undergoing other organizational change. In 1990, Abrahams took 
the job at the new publication. He has since built the journal into 
an enterprise that includes dozens of contributors and an editorial 
board of distinguish scientists and, of course, the IgNobels. In its 
own way, the journal has high standards. ``We turn down more than 
10 pieces for every one we accept,'' Abrahams said. ``I think that's 
a higher rejection rate than Science or Nature. But then, people think 
twice before submitting an article to Science or Nature. Apparently 
people don't always think twice before submitting a piece to us.'' 
The journal's contents are divided between real scientific papers 
with a humorous side and unreal ones with an occasionally serious 
side. Together, they demonstrate, as the physics laureate Sheldon 
Glashow puts it: ``Scientists do have a sense of humor. Some of them, 
anyway.'' The journal has a paid circulation of 2,000 (at $23 a year) 
and the IgNobel Prize presentation annually draws a sellout crowd 
of 1,200 to the Sanders Theater, where it is broadcast on National 
Public Radio. There are recurring themes. The engineering study ``Stress 
Analysis of a Strapless Evening Gown,'' first reported in The Journal 
of Irreproducible Results in the 1950s, later appeared in musical 
form at the IgNobel ceremonies. Deborah Henson-Conant, a professional 
harpist, had turned the work into a four-movement orchestral work. 
``Deborah gives a demonstration as she plays,'' Abrahams said. Nor 
does the journal shy away from expose. In 1995, not long after the 
Public Broadcasting Service began the children's show Barney, featuring 
a purple dinosaur, the journal published a report of an investigation 
that used a wide-field X-ray device to observe Barney at a suburban 
shopping mall, and to get images of Barney's skeletal structure. While 
Barney's external morphology looked to the researchers like that of 
bipedal ornithischian dinosaurs, ``X-ray photographs of Barney have 
provided our most astounding observations,'' wrote the authors, Edward 
C. Theriot and Earle E. Spamer of the Academy of Natural Sciences 
in Philadelphia, and Arthur E. Bogan of Freshwater Molluscan Research 
Center, in Sewell, N.J. Barney's skeleton was ``clearly hominid both 
in morphometry and distribution of osteological elements.'' They went 
on, ``if a skeleton of a proto-human cannot be distinguished from 
that of Barney, there is a likelihood that some of the skeletal specimens 
of early hominids _ ``Lucy'' for example _ may, in fact, be a skeleton 
of a Barney ancestor.'' The journal has also scored some firsts. One 
article suggested that if surgery may have to be repeated, surgeons 
should install zippers, not sutures. Nowadays, surgical zippers are 
actually used in some procedures.
