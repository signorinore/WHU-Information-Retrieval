The government's party has once again gained overwhelming control 
over county mayors' offices and the local legislature in the troubled 
state of Chiapas, according to results announced Monday. With 90 percent 
of the votes counted, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known 
as the PRI, had won 77 of 103 counties and 17 of the 24 seats in the 
state Congress that were up for election. In a significant change 
for this tumultuous state, home to the Zapatista guerrilla group, 
no serious violence was reported during the voting. Instead, apathy 
was the prevailing spirit, with voter turnout well below 50 percent 
in many regions. The PRI kept its hammerlock even though it is no 
longer a majority in Chiapas in terms of the number of votes cast. 
In the voting for the state congress, the PRI won 280,921 votes and 
the combined opposition took 282,327. But the opposition vote was 
split between two parties, the left-of-center Party of the Democratic 
Revolution and the conservative National Action Party.
