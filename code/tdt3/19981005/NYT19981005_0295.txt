In his last novel, the Pulitzer Prize-winning ``American Pastoral,'' 
Philip Roth gave us a hero _ one Seymour (Swede) Levov of New Jersey 
_ whose life mirrored the historical convulsions of the '60s, '70s 
and '80s, as America lurched from complacency into confusion, from 
deliberate innocence into frantic disillusion. The interplay of public 
tragedy and private betrayal is also the animating force behind Roth's 
new novel, ``I Married a Communist,'' a novel that purports to do 
for the cold war period what ``Pastoral'' did for the era of Vietnam. 
Unfortunately, ``I Married a Communist'' lacks the cohesive, cumulative 
power of ``Pastoral.'' Its view of the world remains hogtied to a 
narrow, personal agenda; its narrative drama is diluted by a willfully 
oblique narrative that frames one story within another and submerges 
one voice within another. The result: a wildly uneven novel that feels 
both unfinished and overstuffed, a novel that veers unsteadily between 
sincerity and slapstick, heartfelt melancholy and cavalier manipulation. 
The discursive narrative of ``Communist'' breaks into several overlapping 
plot lines. The first is a sort of elegiac prequel to ``The Ghost 
Writer,'' recounting the intellectual coming of age of the young Nathan 
Zuckerman: his search for a spiritual father, his eager apprenticeship 
at the feet of several mentors and his gradual loss of innocence. 
Whereas Roth's favorite alter ego was torn between two literary role 
models in ``The Ghost Writer'' _ between the reclusive, ascetic Lonoff 
and the flamboyant, self-dramatizing Abravanel _ he finds himself 
torn, in this novel, between his teacher Leo Glucksman's modernist 
esthetic and his friend Ira Ringold's communist manifesto, between 
a commitment to art for art's sake and a commitment to the dogma of 
social change. The bulk of ``I Married a Communist,'' however, is 
less concerned with Nathan than with Ringold, his childhood mentor. 
Like Swede Levov in ``American Pastoral,'' Ira is meant to be a representative 
man, another American innocent sucked up, spun around and spit out 
by the great whirlwind of American history. Ira, we're repeatedly 
told, is a huge, larger-than-life figure _ an Abraham Lincoln look-alike, 
endowed with an overheated idealism, a violent temper and a restless 
need to reinvent himself. Ira has dug ditches, worked as a stevedore 
and spread the communist gospel, an increasingly dangerous undertaking 
in 1950s America. Ira has also become the star of a radio show called 
``The Free and the Brave'' and married the sophisticated actress Eve 
Frame. To the young Nathan, Ira is a father figure who could teach 
him about ``the brutish American stuff'' that he has yet to encounter 
himself. He had ``never before known anyone whose life was so intimately 
circumscribed by so much American history,'' never known ``anyone 
so immersed in his moment or so defined by it. Or tyrannized by it, 
so much its avenger and its victim and its tool.'' Though Roth's evocation 
of Nathan's filial relationship with Ira (by turns worshipful, tender 
and disillusioned) is as powerful as any of the son-father, apprentice-mentor 
relationships limned in the author's fiction, Ira himself remains 
annoyingly opaque. Seen only through the hazy scrim of secondhand 
accounts, Ira never becomes more than a cardboard symbol, a sort of 
all-purpose martyr to right-wing zealots and vindictive women. It 
is through Nathan's recollections of the long-winded reminiscences 
of Ira's brother, Murray, that we learn about Ira's ill-fated marriage 
to the beauteous but treacherous Eve and his precipitous fall from 
grace. As Murray tells it, Eve's fame had protected Ira from the wrath 
of red-baiters in the government, but the collapse of their marriage 
and Eve's publication of a best-selling tell-all book (titled ``I 
Married a Communist'') have swift, fateful repercussions. Ira loses 
hisjob, his reputation and his cool. All the violence in his nature, 
so long suppressed, comes bubbling to the surface, and he vows to 
exact revenge. Roth has always liked to work imaginative variations 
on his own life, and the reader familiar with that tendency is apt 
to suspect that ``I Married a Communist'' is his own revenge on his 
former wife, actress Claire Bloom, who published a memoir two years 
ago that depicted him in unflattering terms. Eve's memoir depicts 
Ira as ``a Machiavellian Communist, a vicious man of enormous cunning 
who nearly ruined my life, my career and the life of my beloved child''; 
Ms. Bloom's memoir (``Leaving a Doll's House'') depicted Roth as ``a 
game-playing Machiavellian strategist'' driven by ``a deep and irrepressible 
rage'' and ``a profound distrust of the sexual power of women.'' In 
this novel, Roth depicts the fictional Eve as a vengeful and self-deluding 
woman in thrall to her impossible daughter from an earlier marriage; 
in her memoir, Ms. Bloom depicted Roth as a possessive and narcissistic 
lover who refused to live under the same roof with her daughter. While 
such matters may be of passing interest to literary gossip mongers, 
they are not transformed, in this case, into plausible or compelling 
fiction. There is something synthetic and contrived about Ira and 
Eve's relationship _ the reader never quite understands what Ira the 
roughneck Communist sees in the social-climbing, Dior-wearing Eve 
or what she sees in him _ and their respective emotional histories 
are rendered in only the most generic and diagrammatic of terms. Eve, 
we're told, is ``all moderation and tact'' onstage, all exaggeration 
and histrionics in real life. Ira, on his part, is supposed to be 
an easy mark for utopian politics and scheming women, given his ``cruel 
family, frustration in school, headlong immersion in the Depression.'' 
As in Roth's 1993 novel, ``Operation Shylock,'' the characters in 
this novel talk and talk and talk; they rant and rave and riff as 
though, like Scheherazade's, their lives depend on their incessantly 
spinning the world into words. Some of the talk is dazzling _ acute 
and funny and inventive _ but even the brilliant talk becomes wearing 
in the end. The reader begins to feel that Nathan and Murray are simply 
talking around and about Ira, telling us what to think of him, without 
allowing us a glimpse of him firsthand. Nathan himself is a curiously 
ghostly figure in this novel. Sometimes he sounds like Nick Carraway: 
``Talking to me doesn't seem to present an obstacle to anyone. This 
is perhaps a consequence of my having gone around for years looking 
as if I needed talking to.'' Sometimes he just sounds like a world-weary 
hermit who has withdrawn into Lonoff-like seclusion: ``I don't want 
a story any longer,'' he declares. ``I've had my story.'' Like Murray, 
the reader (particularly the reader unfamiliar with Nathan's earlier 
appearances in the ``Zuckerman Bound'' trilogy, and his tumultuous 
encounters with celebrity and fame) is inclined to wonder how ``this 
very intense boy so much looking forward to participating in life'' 
ended up ``a man by himself in the woods,'' how this onetime apprentice 
to Ira, so in love with the idea of the ``common man,'' ended up becoming 
a writer devoted to scrutinizing his own psyche. As for this novel, 
it may masquerade as a parable about America in the 1950s and the 
wages of McCarthyism, but it's actually a smaller, less ambitious 
work, a novel that, in the end, has less in common with the capacious 
social vision of ``American Pastoral'' than with the sexual wars and 
mirror games of Roth's earlier and more solipsistic fiction. PUBLICATION
