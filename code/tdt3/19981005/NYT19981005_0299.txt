Late Sunday into early Monday, a series of thunderstorms dropped more 
than five inches of rain on Kansas City, causing widespread flooding 
throughout the city. The heavy storms were ignited as an approaching 
cold front intercepted a steady flow of moist air streaming north 
from the Gulf of Mexico. On Tuesday, the threat for heavy rain will 
shift to the Mississippi and lower Ohio River Valleys as the front 
presses slowly eastward. Scattered strong thunderstorms erupting within 
the area of rain may produce a few tornadoes, as a jet stream disturbance 
passes overhead. Behind the front, gusty breezes from the northwest 
will direct cooler and drier air into the southwest Plains. Farther 
north, lingering moisture in the lower levels of the atmosphere will 
produce clouds and chilly showers over the northern Plains. Sunny 
skies will cover the Northeast as strong high pressure over Ontario, 
Canada, settles south across the region. After a cold morning with 
patchy frost, temperatures will rebound into the 50s and middle 60s 
by afternoon. These conditions will make for prime leaf viewing weather 
as interior New England approaches peak color. Farther southwest, 
air moistening upon ascent of the central and southern Appalachians 
will cause clouds to persist from the western Carolinas to central 
Pennsylvania. Elsewhere, mainly sunny and dry conditions will cover 
the Rockies and Pacific Coast as an expansive area of high pressure 
covers the interior West. Offshore breezes will cause unusually warm 
air to reach the California coast. FOCUS: Fogs of October October 
can be a foggy month in the Northeast. The stage is set by a bevy 
of slow high pressure systems that foster clear skies and light winds 
during the lengthening darkness of October nights. These conditions 
favor maximum cooling of the ground. Nocturnal chill is enhanced in 
deep valleys, where heavy, cold air drains gently down mountains. 
Once a layer of still air in contact with the chilling ground is cooled 
sufficiently, invisible water vapor condenses into trillions of tiny 
water droplets, forming fog. The tranquil fogs of October fade once 
the stirring winds of November arrive.
