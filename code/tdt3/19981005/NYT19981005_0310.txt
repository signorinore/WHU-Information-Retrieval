Petah Coyne, a small woman clad in an oversize T-shirt, stood in the 
center of Galerie Lelong on West 57th Street one recent day and started 
to explain her latest artistic odyssey. ``Two years ago, I had the 
hair and the animals,'' she said. Now she was installing 15 intricate 
sculptures that look different from anything she has done in the past. 
In some works, horsehair is woven and tied like Irish lace and nestled 
with antique stuffed birds, beetles and foxes. In others, statues 
of the Madonna are shrouded in rivers of horsehair braids. The show, 
which opened on Sept. 11 and runs through Oct. 16, is called ``Fairy 
Tales,'' and Ms. Coyne's layered tableaux are meant to be dreamy and 
mystical, evoking spirituality and afterlife. A wall hanging that 
yokes two birds in flight, for example, is about her older brother, 
who died a few years ago. ``We're going in different directions, but 
we're still connected,'' she said. It all seems so coherent now. But 
as Ms. Coyne talks about the creative process, which is, after all, 
a much-studied but still elusive subject, it is clear that while she 
was going through it, it remained a mystery even to her. None of her 
work is really planned, though Ms. Coyne tries to peer into her own 
mind by changing materials every few years. ``It's like having the 
rug pulled out from under me,'' she said. ``It makes me focus on what 
I'm trying to say.'' Ms. Coyne, who is 45 and married, is the daughter 
of a military father whose family moved many times before settling 
in Dayton, Ohio. Her mother, a writer, strove to give her children 
experiences as well as education. Ms. Coyne was not permitted to watch 
television, for example, but was taken to live both among the Amish 
and in the south of France for summers. Ever the artist, Ms. Coyne 
was home-schooled as a teen-ager so she would have more time for art. 
Today she acknowledges the influence of artists like Eva Hesse and 
Louise Bourgeois, and feels apart from the prevailing contemporary 
art movements that deal with political themes, the body and disease. 
For her current exhibition, Ms. Coyne simply began working. There 
was no moment of inspiration. She arrived at these sculptures intuitively, 
by trial and error, in a two-year labor-intensive process that eventually 
involved 30 helpers, mostly unpaid interns. In hindsight, she tells 
how she was influenced subconsciously by a 17th-century tale she learned 
on a fellowship in Japan, by her upbringing as a Catholic and by a 
visit to Guanajuato, Mexico, where she saw how the hair on the ``macabre 
mummies'' there grew after death. In the past, she has worked with 
sticks, mud, black sand, dead fish and car parts. Last time around, 
she decided to work with wax, assembling dense chandelierlike sculptures 
adorned with satin ribbons, artificial flowers and stuffed birds, 
after a friend sent her a box of candles. This time, the hair also 
came from a friend, the artist Ann Hamilton, who had used horsehair 
to make a huge, undulating carpet as part of her show at the Dia Center 
for the Arts in 1993-94. When she dismantled the installation, Ms. 
Hamilton offered the horsehair to Ms. Coyne. Ms. Coyne also took on 
another challenge. Her works have always hung from the ceiling. ``Never 
before have I been on the floor or the wall, and I wanted to see if 
I could,'' she said, speaking of the shift in perspective. ``It requires 
a different way of thinking, like a sculptor going to painting. It 
was the tougher challenge, more than changing media. It throws you 
so off you don't even know if you're an artist any more.'' Grappling 
with both changes, Ms. Coyne twice postponed her show at Galerie Lelong, 
taking apart what she had done and beginning again. ``You don't know 
that it's not working until you're finished with something,'' she 
explained. This time in particular, she added, ``I feel vulnerable 
because the pieces are so new.'' Usually, Ms. Coyne completes her 
works in a new medium in perhaps a year, then keeps the sculptures 
in her Brooklyn studio for another year, sometimes tinkering a little 
further. ``I'd feel like I'd lived with them for a while'' before 
sending them out into the world, she said. Ms. Coyne has exhibited 
widely and won many awards and fellowships. She was featured on the 
cover of Art News magazine two years ago. She has works in the permanent 
collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American 
Art, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta 
and the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, among other institutions. 
``Her work appeals to the adventurous collector,'' said Jack Shainman, 
the dealer she left a few years ago for what both describe as business 
and personal reasons. ``I always did well with her.'' But she dared 
not ask for more time from Galerie Lelong. The dealer is a new one 
for Ms. Coyne, who does make her living as an artist (her works fetch 
$9,500 to $35,000). When she signed on with Lelong in a flowers-and-champagne 
celebration last fall, she had promised to be ready for a show by 
March. At the time, Mary Sabbatino, Lelong's director, was acquainted 
with Ms. Coyne's previous work. She was aware of the new ingredients 
_ the hair, the Madonnas and the birds. But that's about all she knew. 
``It's an act of faith,'' Ms. Sabbatino said, describing the relationship 
between gallery and artist. ``You believe they'll deliver a great 
new body of work, but I had no idea what she was doing.'' At the time, 
Ms. Coyne was not sure either. ``Somewhere inside, I knew where I 
was going,'' she said. But unlike many artists, she works ``organically,'' 
without drawings or jottings on paper. Her first task was separating 
Ms. Hamilton's salt-and-pepper rug, which used horsehair from China, 
into black and gray strands and washing them. She also did research. 
Ms. Coyne had seen Victorian jewelry woven and braided from human 
hair in an exhibition, and she called on a researcher at the New York 
Public Library to find her an illustrated book about it. After studying 
these 100-year-old patterns, Ms. Coyne set out to make them more contemporary. 
``For three months, I worked alone, from 7 to 7 in my studio, five 
or six days a week,'' she said. ``I just started messing with the 
materials, like a cook. In the beginning, you're doing battle with 
the material _ you have to let it be what it is. I began with making 
simple jewelry, but it looked so contrived.'' Ms. Coyne says she felt 
pressure: ``You're thinking, can I rise above this? Can I make something 
out of something I know nothing of that says something?'' And what 
is she saying? ``That comes,'' she said. ``I know the issues I'm dealing 
with.'' Critics and curators have noted that Ms. Coyne's work speaks 
about contradictions and conflicts, between, for example, beauty and 
decadence or purity and sexiness, as well as about life's cycles. 
Rebirth is another recurring theme, an obvious one in her new sculptures. 
Most of her animals were stuffed by 19th-century taxidermists; she 
bought them from museums whose dioramas had been replaced by high-technology 
displays. ``This is the residue of life, discarded things, and I'm 
trying to give them a second life,'' she said. ``That means, I guess, 
that I believe in heaven and hell.'' She added a moment later: ``Did 
you know that in medieval Catholicism, birds take the souls to heaven?'' 
The Madonnas have a different genesis. In the 17th century, when the 
poor people of Kyoto were building a Buddhist temple, the women were 
asked to cut off their hair, which was braided into ropes used to 
haul trees from the forest. Seeing the braids on display in Japan, 
Ms. Coyne was moved, saddened by the women's loss for their faith. 
As these thoughts ran through her mind, Ms. Coyne and her assistants 
worked on all the sculptures at once, not one at a time. Late last 
winter, feeling stuck, she invited an artist friend over to look at 
what she had accomplished and review it _ something she had not done 
since her early 30s, when she was a member of an informal group of 
artists who criticized each other's work. ``Usually, you don't want 
feedback,'' she said, ``but I was really having a difficult time with 
this.'' She was right to worry. Her friend gave her a thumbs down, 
and she postponed the exhibition until April-May and began making 
changes. Weeks later, she invited a second artist friend to view her 
revisions. Both times, she said, ``They laid into me. I felt a failure. 
One friend said to me, `It's the worst you've ever done.''' They said 
it was too pretty, too decorative, too obvious. The next day, everything 
was in shreds. ``The second time, I was brutal, because I was ready 
to trash the whole thing,'' she explained. Mentally, she felt she 
had made a leap, and in June, Ms. Coyne finally began to feel good 
about the direction of her work. ``I said for sure I'd be ready in 
September, so that's when I got interns,'' she said. Eight of them 
at a time came, mostly from art schools. ``It was like a sewing circle,'' 
Ms. Coyne said. ``I wouldn't let them talk. We listened to books on 
tape. Because this is `Fairy Tales,' a lot of the books on tape were 
fairy tales. ``My payback to them was to have visiting artists come 
at lunchtime that they could talk to. They were so great. It was so 
hot, and they wove eight hours a day, four days a week.'' Even then, 
when Ms. Coyne was plowing ahead with determination, she was fragile. 
``I asked them not to comment on my work,'' she continued. ``I'd get 
very insecure. You're so vulnerable in your studio unless you're braced 
for it and ask for an opinion. It may change what you're doing.'' 
In the race to finish, Ms. Coyne was working 90 to 100 hours a week 
in the studio. ``It would have taken me alone 15 years,'' she said. 
Ms. Coyne said she could not possibly have children: ``There's too 
much labor in the studio.'' For years she has called her sculptures 
``my girls.'' ``Each one has such a personality,'' she said. ``I like 
to fuss over them. They're like invalids; they can't live without 
me.'' As she installed the works at Lelong, she said that except for 
her assistants and her husband, ``No one has seen them, not even my 
parents.'' ``I never think about how people will react,'' she said. 
``That would be too horrifying. I'd love to just put it up and disappear, 
go to China.'' Ten days later, on the night of her opening, Ms. Coyne 
was dressed in a long black dress and black lace shawl, a bouquet 
of irises and lilies in her hands, greeting her friends and friends 
of the gallery. She smiled constantly, not showing the conflict she 
feels about yielding the results of her labors. ``I always feel so 
sad'' when the works are sold, she said. ``I'm afraid, horrified, 
to go back to the studio. It will be so empty.'' But within days, 
Ms. Coyne seemed ready to move on to something new. In between the 
hours she spent on jury duty, she was out photographing the city's 
architecture, particularly 18th-century buildings, reading William 
Faulkner, thinking about the way people whisper and contemplating 
the possibilities of working with cement. Where this will lead she 
is not sure. About half of Ms. Hamilton's gift of hair remains, and 
she might use that. But, she cautioned, ``I won't be weaving it, like 
this.''
