Vice President Al Gore arrived for the funeral Monday of the former 
five-term mayor of Los Angeles, Tom Bradley, in a long motorcade, 
helicopters hovering overhead. He told the mourners that he had come 
to celebrate the life of a great American, ``in many ways the Jackie 
Robinson of public service.'' Leon Cheatham, who is 51 and unemployed, 
arrived on foot. He left his house at 7 a.m. Monday and walked more 
than two miles but he could not get into the church. The sanctuary 
was already packed with the high and mighty and the ordinary, who 
were in line as early as 6 a.m. to attend the funeral, which started 
at 10 a.m. Cheatham and dozens of others had to listen to the service 
over loudspeakers from across the street. ``I don't have the money 
to spare to catch buses and stuff,'' Cheatham said. ``So, I walked. 
I just had to come to pay my respects. Mayor Bradley didn't have no 
color barrier or nothing. He just loved people and brought them together.'' 
For more than three hours, Los Angeles said farewell to Bradley, who 
died last week at the age of 80 after spending much of his life breaking 
one color line after another in his adopted home town. He was the 
first black police lieutenant in Los Angeles, the first black member 
of the City Council, and the first, and so far only, black mayor of 
this sprawling and diverse city. He was also the only Los Angeles 
mayor to serve for 20 years. ``He was an impossible act to follow,'' 
said the city's current mayor, Richard J. Riordan, who did follow 
Bradley into office when Bradley decided not to run for a sixth term 
in 1993. ``He was a giant of a man,'' Riordan added, ``physically, 
spiritually and mentally. He lead Los Angeles with finesse, with grace 
and with class.'' Speaker after speaker, inside the First AME Church 
and outside on the curb, described Bradley's long life as the American 
Dream come true. He was the grandson of slaves, Gov. Pete Wilson of 
California told the mourners. ``Divine nature gave us Tom Bradley,'' 
he said. ``It was more our good fortune than Tom's that God put this 
man, this grandson of a slave, on a path to this great city that he 
would one day lead.'' He was the son of Texas sharecroppers, Gore 
said, ``making history with his quiet dignity.'' He was a role model, 
said the Los Angeles police chief, Bernard Parks, who is also black. 
``I can honestly say,'' Parks said, ``there would not be a Chief Bernard 
Parks today if there had not been a Tom Bradley.'' He was an ordinary 
man with the courage to dream impossible dreams and then make them 
come true, said Yvonne B. Burke, a Los Angeles County supervisor. 
He was a loyal man who cared about the poor, said ``Sweet'' Alice 
Harris, a longtime neighborhood advocate in the Watts section of Los 
Angeles. ``He didn't bring us fishes down there,'' she said. ``He 
taught us how to fish and he didn't leave us if the fish didn't bite.'' 
In life, Bradley was known as a coalition builder, a man with a golden 
gift, the ability to bring people together across color and class 
lines. In death, he was still doing so. Gathered in the church were 
San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, musician 
Stevie Wonder, Sen. Barbara Boxer and George Deukmejian, the former 
Republican California governor, who narrowly defeated Bradley in 1982 
when Bradley tried to become the state's first black governor. On 
the hilly streets outside of the church, black, white, Asian and Hispanic 
mourners huddled in the shade as the voices from a 100-member choir 
singing ``Grace of God'' poured out of a loudspeaker. Marie Arvealo 
and her daughter, Connie, each stood with a copy of the L.A. Watts 
Times newspaper over their hearts. On the front page was a photograph 
of Bradley. ''I remember him with love,'' Mrs. Arvealo said. Across 
the street, Kate Wilkerson, 75, sat in the sun on one of the white 
folding chairs set up outside by the church for the overflow crowd. 
She came to the service by bus. ``I didn't leave home meaning to come 
here,'' she said. ``I was planning on paying some bills, but I just 
got drawn here. As far as I'm concerned, he was the best mayor we 
ever had. My bills may not get paid today.'' Melvin Hill, 34, was 
just a boy when Bradley was first elected mayor in 1973. To pay his 
respects and to make a few dollars, Hill and his friends made up some 
T-shirts with a series of photographs, depicting stages of Bradley's 
life, from his days as a track star at UCLA, to his time on the police 
force and finally his years as mayor. ``A lot of older black people 
are buying the shirt,'' Hill said. ``They can relate best to his struggle 
from sharecropper to mayor of L.A. But if you think about it, what 
he did was incredible.'' On the front of the shirt it says, ``Mr. 
Mayor, thanks for the memories.''
