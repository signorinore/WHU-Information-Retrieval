The General Motors Corp. is rebounding faster than expected from the 
strike that shut down virtually all of its North American factories 
during the summer, according to sales figures reported Monday. GM 
said September vehicle sales totaled 393,364 cars and light trucks, 
a 3.1 percent decline compared with the strong sales in the month 
a year earlier but less of a drop than analysts had expected. GM's 
truck sales totaled 164,196 vehicles, down 1.5 percent. Car sales 
were off 4.2 percent, at 229,168 units. GM closed the 1998 model year, 
which ended on Sept. 30, selling 4.6 million light vehicles, down 
2.6 percent. Even so, in September, GM's market share bounced back 
to 31 percent, about the level it was at before the 54-day strike 
began in early June. GM had not expected its market share, which had 
slumped to 21 percent, to reach 30 percent until this month. ``Our 
sales numbers show that we're back,'' Roy S. Roberts, vice president 
and general manager for GM field sales, service and parts, said at 
a news conference Monday. Indeed, the numbers were better than analysts 
had predicted. ``My estimate assumed GM would be down 6 percent from 
September last year,'' said David Healy of Burnham Securities in New 
York. ``A lot of the rapid rebound was due to the very heavy rebates 
on leftover 1998 models.'' GM extended its production of 1998 models 
longer than is typical to use up leftover parts. GM officials, however, 
vehemently denied that the auto maker was offering larger incentives 
than its rivals. ``We're not leading this parade,'' Roberts said. 
According to GM's estimates outlined at the news conference Monday, 
the Ford Motor Co. spent an average of $2,200 a car and $1,400 a truck 
on incentives in the third quarter, compared with $1,500 a car and 
$1,300 a truck for GM. ``There's been a lot written about us being 
higher on incentives,'' said Mike DiGiovanni, GM's chief forecaster. 
``But Ford just completely outspent us hugely in the third quarter 
because we were hit by the strike and didn't have product.'' Ford 
refuses to release its per-vehicle incentives, calling it proprietary 
information. George Pipas, Ford's sales analysis manager, said that 
calculating a rival's incentive spending required complicated calculations 
and too many assumptions to make the numbers valid. Indeed, Healy 
agreed that GM outspent Ford, estimating that GM's incentives amounted 
to about $1,400 a vehicle in the third quarter; Ford's were slightly 
less at $1,300. Ford also released its sales figures Monday, saying 
that it sold 326,941 Ford, Mercury, Lincoln and Jaguar cars and trucks 
in September, up 4.1 percent compared with sales in the month a year 
earlier. Truck sales totaled 196,707, up 9.2 percent. Car sales were 
down 2.6 percent, at 130,234. Ford's market share for September amounted 
to 25.2 percent, down from 25.6 percent in the month a year earlier. 
Ford's sales for the model year were 3.8 million, about even with 
the previous year. GM and Ford were the last auto makers to report 
September sales. Their numbers put total American vehicle sales for 
the month at 1,279,264 cars and light trucks, a 6 percent increase 
compared with figures from September 1997. Car sales totaled 684,786 
units, up 2.4 percent; truck sales increased 10.4 percent, to 594,478 
vehicles. That put the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for 
light vehicles at 15.6 million cars and light trucks for September. 
``What jumps out of the September sales report is the overall strength 
of the industry,'' Healy said. ``We are running above trend despite 
the volatile stock market, the expiration of high incentives and the 
effects of the G.M. strike.'' Despite the tumbling stock market and 
slips in consumer confidence, GM and Ford are bullish on car and truck 
sales in the fourth quarter. GM intends to build 1.5 million cars 
and trucks for the last three months of the year, the highest level 
for a fourth quarter in a decade. With all its factories running at 
full speed and many of them on overtime, GM's inventories continue 
to run at only about 80 percent of what is typical. The average day's 
supply of cars and trucks on G.M. dealer lots is about 58 days, with 
supplies of the most popular vehicles, such as the Pontiac Grand Prix, 
much less than that. Ford added 20,000 vehicles to its fourth-quarter 
production plan, pushing its production to 1.1 million vehicles in 
the quarter.
