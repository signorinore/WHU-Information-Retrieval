The students' pens in the classroom at the University of Maryland 
School of Law were poised the way law students' pens often are. The 
topic of the lecturer, Alan I. Baron, seemed dry enough to be the 
usual law school fare: compliance with subpoenas seeking documents. 
But the point of the lesson was not from the usual stale old cases 
_ it was from the headlines. ``You've got to assume if you're turning 
over documents to Congress that they're going to be made public,'' 
Baron advised the would-be lawyers. ``And if they're really, really 
hot documents, they're going to be above the fold in The Washington 
Post within three days.'' The era of the permanent investigation of 
the president has produced all sorts of legal curiosities. The latest 
is a crop of courses on the subject at law schools across the country. 
In these classes, leaks, politics and the president's videotaped testimony 
are as important as the established precedents law students have been 
poring over for generations. The course here, ``Legislative Investigations,'' 
drew students for all sorts of reasons. Scott Conwell, 34, said after 
class that in the course, as perhaps in the country, ``the politics 
and the legal are intertwined'' in a way that ``keeps us awake.'' 
David Coughlin said he had signed up to find out how investigations 
of important officials were conducted and how they ``could be thwarted, 
which was obviously happening.'' Catherine Allen, 24, seemed to have 
thought more than most about the practical applicability of such a 
course. She said she had watched the legal experts on television, 
the legion of ``talking heads,'' discuss the same legal questions 
that have been covered in class. Presto. She had found a potential 
legal job she knew she could handle. ``They just completely did not 
understand the basic legal principles,'' she said. ``I said, `OK, 
I want that job.''' There is no evidence that law schools are incorporating 
the president's difficulties into their offerings to increase their 
graduates' opportunities in the talking-head market. But courses dealing 
with various aspects of the endless legal tangle in Washington are 
proliferating. At the University of Florida College of Law in Gainesville, 
Charles W. Collier planned a class for next semester that could cover 
legal issues just when they are preoccupying Congress: ``Constitutional 
Theory: Presidential Impeachment.'' At Widener University School of 
Law in Wilmington, Del., the New England School of Law in Boston and 
other law schools, professors said they were expanding normally abbreviated 
discussions of impeachment in their constitutional law classes. And 
at Harvard Law School this semester, Alan M. Dershowitz is teaching 
a course called ``The Presidential Investigation: A Cast of Ethical 
Problems.'' He said it dealt with issues like ``the Kendall problem,'' 
named for President Clinton's private lawyer, David E. Kendall. Dershowitz 
described the dilemma as a circumstance in which a lawyer might have 
a client who wants to testify before a grand jury but ``doesn't want 
to be completely frank and candid.'' The course here in Baltimore 
is taught by two adjunct professors, Baron, a lawyer in private practice 
in Washington, and Glenn F. Ivey, a former prosecutor who is now the 
chairman of the Maryland Public Service Commission. Until March, Ivey 
was chief counsel to the Senate Democratic leader, Senator Tom Daschle 
of South Dakota, and in earlier Congressional jobs he worked on Whitewater 
and other investigations. Baron, who was once impeachment counsel 
to the House of Representatives in the cases of two federal judges, 
was recently minority counsel to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee 
for the investigation into campaign finance abuses. On Friday night, 
the lecturers described for their students the nitty-gritty of working 
on such cases. How, one student asked, does a congressional lawyer 
get someone cited for contempt? ``Subcommittee, committee, floor'' 
votes, Ivey said. Though few legal textbooks say so, the two teachers 
told their students that time could be an important tool in fighting 
any congressional inquiry. Speaking purely theoretically, they said, 
delay can mean the election of a new Congress, whose members might 
view alleged offenses differently from their predecessors. Baron described 
one age-old strategy for dealing with such investigations. ``Run the 
clock,'' he said. Sometimes, the students seemed puzzled by the fine 
points of legal warfare. Then it became clear. For example, Ivey was 
describing how one strategy in trying to thwart an investigation was 
to wait until the eve of a congressional hearing and then dump thousands 
of pages of documents on the chief investigator. If you are that lawyer, 
Ivey said, ``your staff is looking at you and saying, `Boss, we can't 
go through 10,000 documents by tomorrow.' '' From his seat one student, 
John Costello, 31, said he understood. ``It sounds to me,'' he said, 
``like the way I'm going to feel a week before the end of this class, 
when the paper's due.''
