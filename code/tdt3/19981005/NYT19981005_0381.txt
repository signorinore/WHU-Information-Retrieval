The question rang forth from the committee room as a succinct outcry 
at what the nation is being put through: ``Is this Watergate or Peyton 
Place?'' The plaintive query, put by Rep. Lindsey Graham to his colleagues 
on the House Judiciary Committee, was the gist of the committee's 
agenda as, steeped in anguish as much as partisanship, the panel proceeded 
toward a formal impeachment inquiry by Congress against President 
Clinton. ``The truth is I have no clue yet,'' said the South Carolina 
Republican as he weighed his own open question: Is President Clinton's 
coverup of an intimate affair with a White House intern the high-crime 
stuff of Richard M. Nixon's downfall? Or is it a gross Beltway bodice-ripper 
that deserves only a sorry rebuke for its relentless domination of 
the nation and its political leaders? For all the allusions to sex 
and mendacity, this day was notable for the frequent invocation of 
the Watergate impeachment scandal of 1974. A shift in mood from the 
sensational to the purgative was in the air as the issue was finally 
put to measure against the Constitution and mercifully free of further 
disclosures about DNA stains and confessional tape-recordings. ``We 
are witnessing nothing less than the symptoms of a cancer on the presidency,'' 
cried Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., Congress' most dedicated Clinton antagonist, 
taking the case to the president's jugular as he invoked the ultimate 
Watergate allusion _ the malignancy warning delivered to Nixon as 
his incumbency approached the brink. But Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., 
was no less passionate as he thundered that the public is smart enough 
to see that Clinton's failings are not the impeachable stuff of Watergate. 
``Is this where we want to set the bar for future presidents?'' he 
boomed out while day-long television coverage delivered the 37-member 
committee as a fresh cast of characters for the impeachment struggle's 
rise to the next tier of national concern. ``End this nonsense,'' 
Wexler pleaded. ``We have work to do.'' The shadow of Watergate took 
hold early as Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., who chairs the committee, 
gaveled the session to order under the committee portrait of Peter 
W. Rodino Jr., the retired committee chairman who presided over the 
downfall of Nixon. Rodino, now a law professor in New Jersey, has 
been quietly consulted by committee members for weeks, as if he offers 
oracular powers in the current struggle. ``I observed that national 
ordeal from afar,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., recalling for 
the committee his law school days at the University of Arkansas. ``The 
rule of law was the mantra and Watergate was the real-life case study,'' 
he said. ``One of the brightest and most respected young law professors 
at that time was William Jefferson Clinton,'' he added in a bittersweet 
tone as he sat in potential indictment of the Little Rock professor 
who became president. Hutchinson offered his own concerns to the panel 
about his law school lessons: ``Are not the important questions the 
same? Is the rule of law less significant today than 25 years ago? 
Is unchecked perjury _ if proven _ less of a threat to our judicial 
system today than when Watergate was the example?'' Through the day, 
Hyde was easygoing as he looked forth upon the scene. Eight seats 
were reserved for the public, with the news media otherwise packing 
Room 2141 in the Rayburn House Office Building. A time-tattered copy 
of the Senate Watergate hearing record tilted on one desk corner. 
A slice of cold pizza curled atop a nest of TV equipment. Rep. Zoe 
Lofgren, D-Calif., leafed through a paperback copy of The Federalist 
Papers as others spoke. ``We would be better off,'' she told the committee 
in her turn, ``if we spent more time reading what George Mason and 
James Madison said to each other than what Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Tripp 
said to each other.'' The rebuke of the president debated by some 
as a possible punishment for the president was already being delivered 
by Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind. He compared military drill sergeants, 
recently court-martialed and imprisoned for having seduced subordinates, 
with their ``commander in chief,'' noting testimony that Clinton was 
on the telephone with a congressman, eating pizza and discussing ``life-and-death'' 
matters in Bosnia, ``while he had a subordinate perform a sex act 
on him.'' ``Conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman,'' the congressman 
added icily. With elections only four weeks off, the Democrats took 
care to endorse the idea of at least a limited inquiry, even as they 
railed against the Republican measure as too open-ended. Some were 
ready to stipulate without further lengthy inquiry Clinton's guilt: 
The president had ``an adulterous relationship with a White House 
employee half his age'' and misled the nation in ``a dangerous game 
of verbal twister in his sworn testimony,'' said Rep. Martin T. Meehan, 
D-Mass., who questioned whether that merited impeachment. As they 
talked toward dusk, committee members said they were fed up with Clinton's 
predicament in many ways. Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., related what 
one furious voter who disagreed with his position told him: ``I hope 
you die a painful death from prostate cancer.'' Various lawmakers 
disowned all sheerly political machinations and fears _ ``even the 
possibility of a President Gore,'' said Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., summoning 
his party strategists' ultimate unintended consequence. ``This is 
about seeking the truth.'' As he mused between Watergate and Peyton 
Place, Graham said censure was a suitable punishment for Clinton ``if 
this guy just has a problem and can't control it.'' ``No need to turn 
the country upside down,'' he advised. But if the president obstructed 
justice by having aides secretly and illegally ``going after women 
or anybody else'' who gets in his way, impeachment is merited, Graham 
said. ``That is Richard Nixon times ten,'' he declared, once more 
summoning the ghost of Watergate before the House committee.
