After a long day that veered from sober constitutional discourse to 
bitter partisan scrapping, the House Judiciary Committee voted along 
party lines on Monday night to recommend that Congress open a formal 
impeachment investigation into a president for only the third time 
in the nation's history. With a 21-16 committee majority, Republicans 
sent to the House a resolution modeled after the language used in 
the Watergate inquiry. It authorizes the committee ``to investigate 
fully and completely whether sufficient grounds exist for the House 
of Representatives to exercise its constitutional power to impeach 
William Jefferson Clinton.'' The Democrats tried and failed, on another 
party line vote, to substitute a plan for a more limited, two-phase 
inquiry. It would have required the committee first to define an impeachable 
offense before deciding whether to open a formal inquiry of Clinton. 
Many Democrats sharply condemned Clinton's behavior but said it fell 
short of warranting impeachment. The full House is set to vote on 
the impeachment inquiry Friday, as one of its last acts before recessing 
for the midterm elections. Throughout the day, the memories of Watergate 
were summoned repeatedly as Republicans and Democrats presented sharply 
different views of the severity of the president's lies and evasions 
over his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern. 
Making the case for an impeachment inquiry, David Schippers, the chief 
investigative counsel for the Republicans, told the committee that 
``substantial and credible evidence'' existed of possibly 15 impeachable 
offenses by Clinton _ more than the 11 such charges made by Kenneth 
Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel. The core of his argument 
concerned the sanctity of the nation's judicial system and the president's 
role as the nation's chief law enforcement officer. ``The principle 
that every witness in every case must tell the truth, the whole truth 
and nothing but the truth, is the foundation of the American system 
of justice which is the envy of every civilized nation,'' he said. 
``If lying under oath is tolerated and when exposed, is not visited 
with immediate and substantial adverse consequences,'' Schippers said, 
``the integrity of this country's entire judicial process is fatally 
compromised and that process will inevitably collapse.'' Schippers 
recast Starr's own charges somewhat. He dropped what many lawyers 
considered to be Starr's two weakest accusations of abuse of power 
stemming from White House claims of executive privilege and from Clinton's 
refusal to voluntarily testify while lying to potential witnesses. 
He divided some of Starr's charges and added several new ones, including 
a failure to disclose Ms. Lewinsky's filing of a false affidavit and 
a ``conspiracy'' to obstruct justice. As evidence of a conspiracy, 
he highlighted three days of constant phone calls to and from the 
White House showing Clinton reaching out to his friend, Vernon Jordan, 
and his secretary, Betty Currie, after he denied a sexual relationship 
with Ms. Lewinsky in a deposition in the sexual harassment case of 
Paula Jones in January. The calls then show Ms. Currie trying repeatedly 
to find Ms. Lewinsky, instructing her in code to ``Call Kay.'' Ending 
his testimony with a touch of drama,, Schippers asked to speak not 
as a committee staff member, but as a citizen, a ``father and a grandfather.'' 
Paraphrasing Sir Thomas Moore from the play ``A Man of All Seasons,'' 
he said, ``The laws of this country are the great barriers that protect 
the citizen from the winds of evil and tyranny.'' Lecturing the committee, 
the Chicago lawyer who is a lifelong Democrat, added, ``Fifteen generations 
of Americans, our fellow Americans, many of whom are reposing in military 
cemeteries throughout the world, are looking down on and judging what 
you do today.'' When the Democrats objected to this, Rep. Henry Hyde, 
the committee chairman who had selected Schippers as his counsel, 
had the remarks removed from the record. In a rebuttal, Abbe Lowell, 
the counsel for the Democrats pn the committee, countered that impeachment 
is reserved only for high crimes against the state and that no matter 
how the Republicans had recast Starr's case, ``one basic allegation 
_ the president was engaged in an improper relationship which he did 
not want disclosed _ is the core charge.'' In contrast to Schippers, 
he contested the legal significance of Clinton's original lie about 
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in the Jones case. Lowell said 
that the judge in the case, Susan Webber Wright of Federal District 
Court in Little Rock, Ark., had called evidence about Ms. Lewinsky 
unessential to the sexual harassment case against the president. He 
noted that the judge ultimately ruled that regardless of what Clinton 
had done with other women, Ms. Jones had not proven that she had suffered 
any harm after her alleged encounter with Clinton. ``The judge was 
giving the committee the ability to determine that the president's 
statements, whether truthful or not, were not of the legal importance 
suggested by Starr,'' he said, ``let alone grave constitutional significance 
to support impeachment.''
