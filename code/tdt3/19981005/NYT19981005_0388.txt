Who needs Congress when there's ``Crossfire''? During the House Judiciary 
Committee's televised debate about an impeachment inquiry Monday, 
Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., a vehement opponent of impeaching the 
president, said he was scheduled to appear on ``Crossfire'' later 
that night with Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., one of the president's fiercest 
critics. ``In an effort not to ruin the show tonight, I'm going to 
wait to respond to Barr's comments earlier until we get on the show,'' 
Wexler said. It was a joke and it wasn't. Television has clearly superseded 
Congress as the primary site of political debate. Even at its most 
vociferous, Monday's House committee meeting seemed quaintly undramatic 
and familiar, as if transcripts of ``Nightline'' or ``This Week'' 
were being read into the Congressional Record. The lack of surprise 
reveals how central television has become in this story, shaping its 
every turn. The committee chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and its 
ranking Democrat, Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, drew their battle 
lines while appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday. What 
were they going to say that was different on Monday? ``What I'm afraid 
we're going to get is an impeachment in search of a high crime,'' 
Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said in the most memorable line on ``This 
Week'' on Sunday. In his opening statement Monday, he plagiarized 
himself: ``Let us not turn this into an impeachment inquiry in search 
of a high crime.'' It was memorable deja vu. The television coverage 
of the hearings also seemed caught in a strange time warp, filled 
with countless allusions to the Watergate hearings of 24 years ago. 
An odd formality was built into the traditional congressional language. 
(``I thank the gentlelady,'' Hyde said in response to comments from 
Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.) And an unusually straightforward aura 
came from the single pool camera feeding all channels the same picture. 
From the opening statements, Watergate proved to be an infinitely 
malleable image, its specter hovering over the debate, used by both 
Republicans and Democrats when it suited their purposes. Conyers said 
the Republicans were trying to ``conjure the ghost of Watergate,'' 
and rejected that. ``This is not Watergate, this is an extramarital 
affair,'' he said. Yet member after member reached for the sense of 
import recalled from those years, in statements loaded with references 
to the Constitution, history and democracy. A glance back at the real 
Watergate hearings suggest more differences than similarities, though. 
Largely experienced through television, Watergate has also been misremembered 
and idealized as a pure, nonpolitical process. The two sets of Watergate 
hearings are, in fact, often conflated in many people's memories. 
There was Sam Ervin's committee investigation in the Senate in 1973 
(the John Dean testimony) and Peter Rodino's House Judiciary Committee 
hearings, which voted articles of impeachment against Richard M. Nixon 
in 1974. But the Rodino committee hearings, now idealized as a model 
of nonpartisan statesmanship, seemed quite otherwise when they were 
shown on the History Channel last week. Party politics and an awareness 
of the television audience were almost as evident then as they are 
now. As one debate stretched into the evening, Rep. Charles Sandman, 
R-N.J., a member of the minority, complained that his opponents were 
playing to the cameras. ``This bunch of baloney was supposed to be 
taken up this afternoon, not tonight,'' he said, but ``there's a bigger 
audience'' in prime time. And on a typical day at the Ervin committee 
(preserved at the Museum of Television and Radio), ABC's coverage 
seemed like a two-man show. During a brief break, anchor Frank Reynolds 
spoke slowly. ``Well, it's about 4:35 in the afternoon,'' he began, 
while their reporter in the committee room, Sam Donaldson (some things 
never change), raced out to the hall to collar an interview subject. 
Today there would be a crew of legal analysts in the studio, as well 
as reporters in the committee room, on the stairs and in the rest 
rooms. So throughout Monday's meeting, the 24-hour news channels (CNN, 
MSNBC and Fox News) struggled to adapt their usual fancy graphics 
and expert-laden approach to the Judiciary Committee's deliberate, 
declamatory process. Early in the day they cautiously dipped in and 
occasionally out of the members' opening statements, as if turning 
away might seem irresponsible. By the end of the afternoon, when the 
most cantankerous debates about limiting the length and scope of an 
impeachment inquiry broke out, it was clear there would be no genuine 
surprises, and the channels moved in and out more freely. It was surely 
happenstance that a committee recess coincided with ``Crossfire'' 
on CNN. Wexler and Barr raced from the committee room to appear on 
the program. Standing side by side, they had nothing more or less 
to say than they had before. And while they were still standing there, 
another part of the screen showed Hyde banging his gavel down to recall 
the meeting to order. CNN switched back to Congress; Wexler and Barr 
returned a little late, as the television show and the official congressional 
debate blended together conspicuously. In reality, they had merged 
long ago.
