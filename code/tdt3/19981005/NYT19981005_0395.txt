The impeachment debate in the House Judiciary Committee received gavel 
to gavel coverage on cable news channels Monday, and a few minutes 
of live coverage on the ABC network. Neither NBC nor CBS had any live 
coverage of the debate, though the two networks did provide a form 
of live coverage Monday night for the vote by the committee. CBS interrupted 
its programming for five minutes to cover the vote, and NBC used a 
part of its screen for a written report on the vote. ABC spokeswoman 
Eileen Murphy said that because of ``Monday Night Football,'' the 
network would not do a live report on the vote. But the network's 
``Nightline'' program was to be based on the debate last night. MSNBC, 
Fox News and Court TV provided live coverage. CNN also focused most 
of its attention during the day on the debate, though it did break 
away for regular programs like its legal discussion program, ``Burden 
of Proof,'' which focused on the debate, as well as for brief reports 
on other stories in the news.
