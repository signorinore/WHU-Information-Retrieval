The annals of crime in metropolitan New York _ a long registry of 
mayhem, thievery and skulduggery _ is replete with tales of clever 
rogues, acts of mindless savagery and other headline-grabbing sensations. 
But a little troupe rounded up Monday on federal burglary and racketeering 
charges, the authorities said, was remarkable for the more prosaic 
qualities usually associated with diligent, middle-aged workers: perseverance, 
attention to details and, above all, longevity. Over the past 15 to 
20 years, officials charged, the suspects _ six men and a woman, most 
of them now in their 50s (one in a nursing home) and dubbed the ``over-the-hill 
gang'' _ made a career of burglary, hitting thousands of homes and 
estates in affluent communities of New Jersey and Long Island, and 
selling the loot to ``fences'' in Manhattan. Carefully selecting targets, 
striking at night when no one was home, five Brooklyn men carried 
out the break-ins, taking furs, jewelry, paintings and antiques, as 
well as cash, and amassing an inventory of stolen goods valued at 
$5 million to $10 million, officials said. Much of it, they said, 
went to a Canal Street gold-and-jewelry store operated by the other 
two defendants. But after years of quiet success, the gang's luck 
ran out, officials said, when federal, state and local law-enforcement 
agencies began to detect patterns of burglaries in disparate places 
like Upper Saddle River and Englewood Cliffs in New Jersey and Old 
Westbury and Old Brookville on Long Island. Surveillance and a two-year 
investigation by a score of agencies led to Monday's arrests. ``This 
was a very sophisticated organization that operated in many different 
towns,'' Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District 
of New York, said at a news conference in Manhattan. ``To catch them, 
it really took a regional approach to law-enforcement.'' Flanked by 
a dozen officials from the FBI and from regional police departments 
and prosecutors' offices, Ms. White announced a 35-count indictment 
accusing the suspects of 20 burglaries in New Jersey that netted $1.2 
million, and/or of involvement in a racketeering conspiracy that transported 
stolen goods over state lines. While only a score of burglaries were 
detailed, Ms. White and others said their investigations showed the 
suspects had actually carried out thousands of burglaries since the 
early 1980s, making off with millions, including $500,000 in jewelry 
in a single haul. The five men accused of committing the burglaries 
were listed as John Davis, 52, described as the mastermind of the 
gang; Fyndle Brooks, 56, who recently suffered a stroke and lives 
in a nursing home; Jerry Richardson, 56; Amos Miller, 51, and Goldie 
Willoughby, 40, all of Brooklyn. Terry Kaplan, 41, and his wife, Martha, 
43, of Manhattan, were accused of conspiring to sell stolen goods 
though a shop they formerly operated at 95 Canal St. At hearings Monday 
night before federal Magistrate Judge Theodore Katz, Davis was held 
without bail, Miller was held for a hearing on Friday and the Kaplans 
were released on personal recognizance bonds. Brooks was ordered held 
at his nursing home. Hearings for Richardson and Willoughby were pending. 
``They were good at what they did,'' William Schmidt, the Bergen County 
prosecutor, said at the news conference. ``These were professionals 
who were very successful, who made a career out of their crimes.'' 
Ms. White said the burglars, operating in groups of three or four, 
staked out estates or large homes in Bergen and Essex Counties in 
New Jersey, or in Nassau County on Long Island, waited until nightfall 
and made sure no one was home. Apparently no one was injured in any 
of the break-ins, officials said. With one acting as lookout and another 
as getaway driver, the team disabled burglar alarms and smashed windows 
or bored holes through doors to gain entry, Ms. White said. One or 
two men then ransacked the homes, taking valuables and cash, usually 
from bedrooms or dining rooms. Afterward, Ms. White said, the gang 
would return to Davis' apartment and split up any cash. The other 
loot would be sold to the Kaplans or to other fences, who would sell 
it from retail outlets in lower Manhattan. Local police departments 
investigated the burglaries, but did not connect them until a pattern 
was detected. ``We started putting together the types of homes and 
the times they would strike at these homes,'' Schmidt recalled. Some 
jewelry was recovered in the ensuing investigation, but the vast bulk 
of the loot has disappeared, the officials said. They said, however, 
that the arrests spelled the end of one of the most successful, and 
durable, burglary rings to operate in the metropolitan area. ``For 
victims, this criminal activity literally hit home,'' said Victor 
Gonzalez, an FBI official in New York. ``It's the sort of crime that 
is particularly upsetting to victims.''
