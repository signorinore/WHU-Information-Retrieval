Motorola Inc., the wireless communications and semiconductor company 
that has been stumbling for about two years, said late Monday that 
its third-quarter earnings were better than expected, largely because 
of an aggressive restructuring and cost-cutting effort. The company, 
which had warned Wall Street a few months ago to expect a flat third-quarter 
profit, said that it continues to suffer from weakening demand for 
its products in Asia, but that its revamping efforts had partly offset 
that slowdown. After the close of trading Monday, Motorola reported 
that it had an operating profit of $40 million, or 7 cents a share, 
excluding special charges, down from $308 million, or 51 cents a share, 
in the period a year earlier. Revenue was $7.15 billion in the third 
quarter, down from $7.35 billion in the quarter a year earlier. Wall 
Street analysts, surveyed by First Call Inc., had been expecting the 
company, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill., to earn a penny a share. 
But the stronger-than-expected showing belies the more serious worries 
that have surrounded Motorola, which has seen its revenues and stock 
price hammered in recent quarters on slackening demand at home and 
abroad for its cellular telephones and computer chips. Monday, ahead 
of the earnings report, shares of Motorola fell $1.4375, to $38.5625, 
its lowest level in more than five years. The stock is down more than 
50 percent from its all-time high, which was set last year. Motorola's 
paging, cellular and semiconductor businesses are all suffering, but 
the company says that it is refocusing its operations, integrating 
units and headed toward greater efficiency. ``The program is on track 
to achieve its goal of an annualized savings rate of at least $750 
million by mid-1999,'' said Robert L. Growney, the company's president 
and chief operating officer. After two years of lackluster earnings 
and heavy criticism, Motorola has moved swiftly in the last six months. 
In June, the company said it would eliminate 15,000 jobs, or 10 percent 
of its work force, and last month Motorola said it was suspending 
construction of a $3 billion chip manufacturing plant in Richmond, 
Va. Analysts have applauded the company's efforts to restructure its 
operations and become more focused, but they say that there are few 
signs Motorola is going to return to strong profitability anytime 
soon. While Monday's report listed a $40 million third-quarter profit, 
cost savings from restructuring were about $140 million, excluding 
special charges. ``It looks like the cost-cutting savings were really 
the difference between the break-even and the results they reported,'' 
said Eric Buck, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``This 
is not from any underlying improvement in the business. They said 
they're not satisfied with their financial performance and they shouldn't 
be; they still have a long way to go.'' Motorola, however, has attributed 
much of its slowdown to the ``continuing impact of adverse business 
conditions in Asia and weakness in semiconductors and paging products 
on a worldwide basis.'' But investors and analysts have criticized 
Motorola for more than a year now for a series of corporate missteps, 
ranging from its failure to move aggressively into the digital cellular 
telephone market, to technical problems with some of its computer 
chips. Cellular telephones using digital technology have become the 
standard, and the Finnish company Nokia has garnered substantial market 
share in recent years from Motorola, which has long been wedded to 
analog technology. Motorola has also seen a sharp slowdown in its 
paging business. Sales in Asia have been particularly troubling. ``The 
Chinese market, which is the largest, is slowing, said Ajay Diwan, 
an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``There's a pause in spending 
there. The million-dollar question is whether China will slow down 
over the long run.'' With cellular telephone sales slackening amid 
fierce competition and semiconductor demand slowing sharply in Asia, 
some analysts said it is surprising that Motorola's revenue is down 
just 3 percent from a year ago. The difficulties in all of its core 
lines of business _ cellular, semiconductor and paging _ could have 
been even worse. But Herschel Shosteck, who runs his own company in 
Wheaton, Md., that tracks the cellular business, says that Motorola 
is still a force in the industry. ``Motorola has an absolute hammerlock 
on distribution,'' he said. ``Once their digital products come to 
market they will regain market share. They're going to continue to 
be a powerful player.''
