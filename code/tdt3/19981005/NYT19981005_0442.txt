Another big loss in stocks and fears of a further deterioration in 
nearly all types of financial assets drove investors worldwide into 
the relative safety of Treasury securities Monday for the fifth consecutive 
day. Bond prices surged for the biggest one-day gain in more than 
a year, pushing yields to another in a series of 31-year lows. By 
the close of trading, yields on the Treasury's 30-year bond had plummeted 
to 4.72 percent, from 4.84 percent Friday, the lowest for long-term 
government debt since April 1967. Prices rose 2 and 2/32 point, or 
more than $20 per $1,000 in face amount, the biggest gain since Sept. 
16, 1997. ``We are seeing a continued flight to quality,'' said David 
Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. ``I don't 
know where the end of this process lies.'' Further deterioration in 
world stock markets Monday only reinforced the demand for Treasury 
securities. Although the Dow Jones industrial average recovered from 
steep losses to end only 58.45 points lower, at 7,726.24, the Nasdaq 
stock market tumbled 78.29 points, or 4.85 percent, to 1,536.69. Most 
stock markets overseas also slumped. Analysts said there was disappointment 
that finance ministers and central bankers attending the annual meeting 
of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund had apparently failed 
to agree on a plan to shore up the faltering international economy. 
``Many went into the weekend thinking a credit package for Brazil 
would be in the works and announced just after the elections, which 
were held on Sunday,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice 
president and chief money market economist at Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter. Sullivan said the recent steep slides in interest rates ``are 
divorced from underlying economic and credit market fundamentals'' 
in the United States. Instead, he said, ``they are based upon a whole 
different attribute: a heightened preference for quality, safety and 
liquidity.'' The severity of the challenge facing policy makers and 
market participants alike was underscored Monday by William McDonough, 
the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Answering questions 
at a meeting of the Institute of International Bankers in Washington, 
McDonough said the current crisis was the most serious since World 
War II, adding that the declines in world markets and economies could 
``get worse because there is a significant possibility of a credit 
crunch.'' ``But the people in this room have the capacity to make 
sure this doesn't happen,'' McDonough said. ``It makes sense to control 
the risk aversion of `let's batten down the hatches and protect our 
institution.' If every institution does that, I can assure you we 
will have a very large credit crunch.'' The collapse in the price 
of riskier fixed-income assets relative to Treasury securities claimed 
another victim Monday, as Criimi Mae Inc., a real estate investment 
trust with a big portfolio of commercial mortgage securities, filed 
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following big losses on its investments. 
``As all of these markets have blown up, the value of Criimi Mae's 
assets plummeted,'' said Jim Callahan, executive director of the Pentalpha 
Group, an investment advisory firm based in Greenwich, Conn. Still, 
Callahan said, ``a lot of people are breathing a sigh of relief at 
what Criimi has done.'' ``Filing for reorganization is a better outcome 
than a fire sale liquidation, like Long-Term Capital,'' he said. Traders 
said Long-Term Capital Management, the formerly high-flying hedge 
fund that was salvaged from near-collapse late last month by a consortium 
of investment banking firms, was in the market Monday selling mortgage-backed 
securities and older Treasury securities, and buying freshly issued 
government notes and bonds. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond 
was not the only maturity that registered big price gains Monday. 
Near the close of trading in New York, the 4.5 percent two-year notes 
were quoted at a price of 100 29/32, up one-quarter of a point, to 
yield 4.02 percent. The price of the 5.25 percent five-year notes 
rose by 17/32, to 105|, to yield 3.96 percent. And the 5| percent 
10-year notes rose a full point in price, to 111 17/32, to yield 4.16 
percent. At one point during the day, yields on the government's two-year, 
three-year and five-year notes were all trading below 4 percent, said 
Sullivan from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
