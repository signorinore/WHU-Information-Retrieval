The managed care companies that shed 250,000 elderly Medicare customers 
last week will have healthier financial statements to show for it, 
starting in the first half of 1999. But many Wall Street analysts 
said that dropping Medicare units in dozens of unprofitable markets 
would not be enough to pull the health maintenance organizations out 
of a three-year earnings slump. Health care costs are rising, and 
the HMOs cannot be sure that big employers will fully accept the large 
premium increases for next year that the companies need to turn around 
their earnings. Many of the biggest HMOs announced that they would 
close their units in areas where the government payments were too 
low to cover rising costs, including suburbs north of New York City, 
the Washington area and rural Northern California. Some HMOs are also 
leaving places where they had a relatively small presence; the United 
Healthcare Corp., for example, is closing its Medicare unit in Dallas. 
But Roberta Walter, a health care analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that 
those HMOs that kept a big Medicare operation would continue to suffer, 
even though earnings were rising on nongovernment business. ``It is 
conceivable that improvement on the commercial side could be offset 
by deterioration on the Medicare side,'' she said. The remaining Medicare 
units will not lose money, she said, but they will not grow robustly. 
And if the HMOs raise rates and reduce benefits, they will not sign 
up thousands of new members as they did in past years, when government 
payments were rising 6 percent to 10 percent a year and the companies 
could offer generous benefits and still turn a handsome profit. Congress 
has placed a 2-percent-a-year ceiling on increases in the rates the 
government pays, and federal officials have so far rebuffed requests 
to let the industry postpone compliance with new regulations and cut 
back some benefits offered to HMO members. HMO executives are ``livid'' 
with anger, said Kenneth Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein 
&AMP; Co. The Federal Health Care Financing Administration required 
them to set their benefit package for 1999 last May and then announced 
regulations in June that will add to the cost of doing business. The 
agency rejected a request last week from the industry to reopen the 
benefits issues. ``It was a double cross,'' Abramowitz said. Federal 
officials insist that they are promoting both Medicare HMOs and traditional 
fee-for-service HMOs. But Abramowitz said he thought that the federal 
financing agency ``regards HMOs as competitors; it's like asking the 
Post Office to set rates for Federal Express.'' Medicare units cost 
United Healthcare $120 million in reduced earnings and cost Aetna 
Inc. $60 million, Abramowitz said. But he said there would be ``money 
to be made next year,'' when the impact of the pullbacks in the Medicare 
units becomes clear. He predicted that United Healthcare, Aetna and 
the Cigna Corp. would be the first to attract investors, after the 
companies report their first- and second-quarter earnings. Ms. Walter 
was more cautious. She recommends a handful of managed care companies, 
largely because they do not have a big stake in Medicare. Her picks 
include Wellpoint Health Networks, Cigna and Trigon Healthcare, a 
publicly traded Blue Cross plan based in Richmond, Va. In the New 
York region, even though Oxford Health Plans announced it was dropping 
26,600, or 17 percent, of its Medicare members, Ms. Walter said she 
had kept a low rating, ``neutral, neutral,'' on the stock. She said 
that Oxford's turnaround plan faced ``a very tough industry environment, 
with costs rising,'' and was ``predicated on a number of assumptions, 
most of which have to go right for the plan to work.'' Edward Keaney, 
an analyst at Volpe, Brown Whelan &AMP; Co. in San Francisco, said 
Pacificare Health Systems, which gets most of its revenues from Medicare, 
``would be a beneficiary of everybody else's pullback.'' Although 
Pacificare dropped 20,000 members of its Secure Horizons Medicare 
division in Northern California, it has been adept in most places 
at shifting financial risks to physician groups. The groups are typically 
paid a set fee for each Medicare member, and it is up to the doctors 
to keep costs within budget. Mimi Willard, a health care analyst at 
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, said some buyers were attracted 
by the low prices of HMO stocks, many of which are near historic lows. 
Also the companies do not have to worry immediately about problems 
in Asia and other foreign countries, and they are ``perceived not 
to have exposure to potential problems in the economy,'' she said. 
Some traders were encouraged when insiders, headed by Dr. Norman Payson, 
the chief executive, recently bought Oxford stock. But Ms. Willard 
agreed with analysts who said the intermediate picture was still uncertain, 
especially for Medicare HMOs. ``These are treacherous times for the 
HMOs,'' said Joyce Albers, who follows managed care companies at Deerfield 
Management, a health care investment fund. ``This is certainly not 
an area for widows and orphans,'' she said.
