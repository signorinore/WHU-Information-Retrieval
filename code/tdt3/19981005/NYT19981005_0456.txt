The voice came from a nearby locker, but its tone and meaning were 
clear. ``Does anybody know what year this is?'' Jeff Nelson asked 
stridently. ``The year is '98. Quit asking about last year. It's '98.'' 
His words were aimed at the group of reporters questioning Mariano 
Rivera about the home run he gave up to Sandy Alomar Jr. that marked 
the beginning of the end of the Yankees' presence in the playoffs 
last year. The home run tied the fourth game of the division series, 
and the Cleveland Indians went on to win that game as well as the 
next. The Yankees, their World Series plans short-circuited, went 
home; the Indians eventually went to the World Series. Nelson, an 
older, more veteran member of the Yankees' relief corps, was trying 
to protect Rivera by suggesting that last year was last year, it's 
over and done with and there's no reason to recall it or dwell on 
it. What Alomar did to Rivera a year ago, he was saying, has nothing 
to do with the American League Championship Series that begins at 
Yankee Stadium Tuesday night. Not everyone in the Yankees' clubhouse 
Tuesday agreed with that view. ``The plane ride home from Cleveland 
was an ugly flight,'' said David Cone, the most candid player in the 
Yankees' clubhouse. ``Guys were as down as I've seen them, very quiet, 
very somber. We're not that far removed from last year. Everybody 
will say that was last year, this is this year. There's a lot of truth 
in that, but I remember it. I'm sure everybody in here does.'' At 
the time, Cone continued, ``you try to block it out, but having lost 
the series, you have four months to reflect. You look back at certain 
things. That's when you dwell on it. We didn't dwell on it at that 
point, but in retrospect you look back and say that was the key.'' 
Rivera, Cone said, took the home run ``very hard.'' Rivera said Monday 
that it shocked him. ``The count was 2-0,'' he recalled. ``The ball 
wasn't in the middle. The ball wasn't inside. The ball was up and 
away.'' The pitch was Ball 3, but it looked good to Alomar. ``I don't 
even remember,'' Alomar said, as if he could forget. ``That was a 
year ago. He was behind in the count, and I saw a fastball and I hit 
it. I was very fortunate that I hit it the other way. If I had pulled 
it, I might have grounded out or fouled it off. But that's old news. 
That's not now. It doesn't matter now.'' Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. 
Players talk about motivation, as if they might need some other kind 
of incentive besides the promise of a World Series championship, a 
ring, a nice check for their troubles. Who really knows what motivates 
or pushes a player? ``If you get caught up in things like that, you 
forget what you're trying to get done,'' Mike Hargrove, the Indians' 
manager, said, standing on a sun-bathed field. ''There's no revenge 
here. They want to beat us so they can get to the World Series. We 
want to do the same thing.'' But suppose in the weird world of professional 
sports, players can summon something extra by using elements outside 
themselves, the psychological boosting the physical. In this instance, 
the Yankees and the Indians could have a conflict, one force butting 
heads with another. The Yankees have extra incentive to beat the Indians 
because the Indians knocked them out of the playoffs prematurely last 
year. The Indians have extra incentive to win because they fell two 
outs short of winning the World Series last year and want to get back 
and win it this year. Which motivating factor would win out? ``I hope 
ours works and theirs doesn't,'' Hargrove said, laughing. Even Cone 
acknowledged that it's impossible to know which factor, if either, 
could have an effect on the way the teams play and the outcome of 
the series. ``It could be a wash,'' he said. ``It could all be propaganda 
for stories. It's hard to quantify the type of effect, the mental 
effect. Does last year carry over to this year? Maybe, maybe not. 
I don't know. ``But it's a good matchup. There's a history here, a 
recent history. How that bears on this series I don't know. Good food 
for thought. Good to talk about. Good for the fans. There are all 
sorts of methods to try to manufacture motivation. There's plenty 
here on the table to look at.'' Whether the past makes an impact on 
the present, it apparently has already affected what has led up to 
the present. ``We came into spring training this year ready to go,'' 
Cone said. ``We worked hard all year. We wanted to get back to this 
point and have another chance.'' The Yankees apparently made a greater 
effort to gain another chance than the Indians. Both teams enjoyed 
large leads and were never really threatened in their divisions, but 
their seasons were markedly different, the Yankees finishing with 
114 victories, the Indians 89. The Indians won only 43 of their final 
85 games. ''I don't know if it was because we were 11 games or 14 
games up,'' Alomar said. ``Sometimes we showed up; sometimes we just 
went through the motions.'' But the Yankees, Alomar was told, had 
an even larger lead throughout the season and they didn't seem to 
turn it off and on. ``I think,'' the catcher said, ``it's a sign that 
even when they turn it off, they're on.''
