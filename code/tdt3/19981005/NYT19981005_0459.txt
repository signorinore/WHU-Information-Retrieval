The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Oct. 6: The Associated 
Press summary of the House Judiciary Committee hearing on Monday was 
admirable for its simple, concentrated statement of Washington's political 
mood and the constitutional quandary presented by a chief executive 
who has squandered public respect. ``No one _ no Republican, no Democrat 
_ defended Clinton's conduct with Ms. Lewinsky or his testimony while 
under oath,'' the AP said. ``The issue was whether the president's 
behavior constituted events worthy of impeachment.'' That issue was 
crisply aired in presentations by David P. Schippers, the counsel 
for the Republican majority, and by Abbe Lowell, the minority counsel. 
Schippers said that Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, had documented 
that Clinton lied under oath. He also said that in his view Clinton 
had worked energetically to obstruct justice, tamper with witnesses 
and suppress evidence sought. As for the argument that he was only 
lying about sexual conduct, not affairs of state, Schippers pointed 
out that under his constitutional oath the president cannot pick those 
legal proceedings in which his word is good and give himself a license 
to lie in others. The details of the underlying case ``are of no significance 
whatever,'' Schippers said. ``It is the oath itself that is sacred 
and must be enforced.'' Lowell put the opposing view as cogently as 
possible. Congress should regard Clinton's testimony as ``misstatements'' 
about a case that came to naught. The president's testimony, ``whether 
truthful or not,'' does not have the constitutional gravity that warrants 
impeachment or removal. Such steps require ``a far higher threshold'' 
than has been reached in falsehoods designed to cover a sexual escapade. 
Starr, he asserted, had tried to ``usurp the constitutional role of 
the House'' by declaring President Clinton impeachable instead of 
making a neutral presentation of evidence. From our point of view, 
these arguments, taken together, show yet again how essential it is 
to reach a negotiated settlement that involves heavy censure and an 
unqualified admission of lying by Clinton. It would be disruptive 
to remove him unless more serious crimes emerge. But far greater damage 
to the American political and legal system would ensue from adopting 
Lowell's argument that the nation's chief law enforcement officer 
can swear to tell the truth and then lie for political convenience, 
to cover affronts to the dignity of his office or to protect his family 
from knowledge about his personal conduct. All are understandable 
human impulses, but the rule of law is too important for this country 
to grant an exemption for presidential foolishness. There are signs 
of movement toward an acceptable resolution. Former President Gerald 
Ford's proposal for condemning the president in the well of the House 
spurred discussion of truncating the impeachment process. This past 
weekend, the White House held back its talk-show attack squad. The 
House Judiciary Committee chairman, Henry Hyde, declared a willingness 
to conclude his committee's deliberations by the end of the year. 
Sooner would be better, but the Democrats have to shop harder for 
a deal. Schippers' stinging recitation of the flurry of phone calls 
among Clinton, Betty Currie and Vernon Jordan should have convinced 
the president's lawyers that the last thing they want is impeachment 
proceedings or a Senate trial on obstruction of justice. Monday's 
hearing should likewise have convinced House Democrats that the Republican 
majority will never buy Lowell's theory on the acceptability of miniature 
lies. But they can probably move the Republicans toward a deal that 
allows this presidency to run its full if inevitably disappointing 
course.
