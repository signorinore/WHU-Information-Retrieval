Will an unusual ad for Absolut vodka carry the headline ``How much 
is that bottle in the window?'' Not really, of course, but the ad, 
which will begin appearing in November issues of magazines, does represent 
a departure for the well-known campaign for Absolut, the vodka brand 
distilled by Vin &AMP; Sprit AB. The eye-catching ad, by the New York 
office of TBWA Chiat/Day, is presented as a store window in progress; 
at the center are the heads, hands, arms and legs of mannequins assembled 
in the familiar shape of the Absolut bottle. The actual headline for 
the ad will be ``Absolut Doonan'' as in Simon Doonan, whose quirky, 
sometimes provocative window displays have helped generate a fashionably 
hip image for the retailer Barneys New York, where he is creative 
director. The Absolut assemblage was produced by Doonan and his display 
team for the ad and photographed in a Barneys window in late August. 
In addition to the dummy bottle _ or bottle of dummies _ there are 
tools of a window trimmer's trade like a stepladder and staple gun; 
blue Barneys shopping bags, and odd touches like a statue of a bird, 
plastic food and a trumpet. The ad reflects efforts by TBWA Chiat/Day 
and Seagram Americas, which imports Absolut, to freshen the formula 
for the long-running campaign by broadening the definition of who 
can take part in the series of pitches devoted to artists. ``Simon 
is certainly an artist in his own right,'' said Richard Lewis, worldwide 
account director for Absolut at TBWA Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide 
unit of the Omnicom Group. ``His canvas is windows and his metier 
is mannequins.'' The artists series began in 1985, four years after 
the start of the Absolut campaign, with an ad depicting an Absolut 
bottle painted by Andy Warhol. The Doonan ad joins unconventional 
art ads that include ``Absolut Isabell,'' for the floral and party 
designer Robert Isabell; short, short stories by such writers as John 
Irving and Arthur Golden, and a coming redesign of the Absolut Web 
site (www.absolutvodka.com) focusing on club disk jockeys like Paul 
Miller, known as DJ Spooky. ``It's another innovative way that Absolut 
is able to reach out to its audience,'' said Jim Schleifer, marketing 
director for the brand at the Seagram Americas unit of Seagram Co. 
in New York. ``By using these artists, we're trying to keep the brand 
on the cutting edge with the early adapters,'' he added, using the 
marketing term for consumers who seek out products ahead of the masses. 
Such shoppers' buying behavior is often emulated by mainstream consumers. 
``We keep extending the boundaries from painters and sculptors,'' 
Lewis said, ``to folk artists, fashion designers, writers, photographers, 
architects, interior designers _ and now window designers.'' ``There's 
a business proposition here as well,'' he added, ``because you're 
talking about people who are image makers and taste formers.'' Doonan, 
who joined Barneys in 1986 and has worked diligently to keep the windows 
shining through the bankruptcy of parent Barney's Inc., demurs at 
being included in those ranks. ``Windows are a really weird form of 
creative expression,'' he said. ``Because they change every bloody 
week, it's hard to think of anything more ephemeral. And they're a 
form of free entertainment that is disappearing as retailers cut back 
on promoting their images on the street.'' ``Absolut started off with 
a lot of hard-core `artists,''' he added, ``so recognizing someone 
with one foot planted firmly in commerce and the other in creative 
makes me proud.'' Doonan pronounced himself ``very happy with the 
ad'' because ``it looks and feels like a Barneys window.'' That was, 
however, not without its difficulties. ``It took us two goes to get 
the shoulder of the Absolut bottle right,'' Doonan said. ``The first 
time it looked like an English milk bottle.'' (He ought to know, having 
been born in Reading, England.) The idea for the ad came from discussions 
Doonan had with Seagram about the book tour for his humorous autobiography, 
``Confessions of a Window Dresser: Tales from a Life in Fashion,'' 
to be published next month by Penguin Studio and Callaway Editions 
Inc. He has previously participated in Absolut promotional events 
that included a Barneys window co-sponsored with Vogue magazine in 
1996 and a recent fund-raiser to fight AIDS. ``People love to watch 
windows being pulled together,'' Doonan said. ``The idea is that the 
bottle grew out of a manic session with a lot of crazed window dressers, 
in whose ranks I include myself.'' Doonan is best known for the colorful 
Barneys Christmas windows that simultaneously embrace and tweak self-promotional 
celebrities from Madonna and Prince to Dolly Parton and Ivana Trump. 
Is a man who so loves to throw a spanner, as the British call a wrench, 
into the star-making machinery now stepping through the looking glass 
_ or window glass _ to embrace that which he cheekily sends up? Those 
who ``think I want to end up like Cindy Adams'' are wrong, Doonan 
declared, adding: ``I'm a ninth-string celebrity. I don't have a desire 
to self-promote other than for God's Love to get a lot of money.'' 
His reference was to God's Love We Deliver, the charity to which he 
will donate his royalties from the book. Asked to explain some of 
the stranger objects in the ad, Doonan laughed and replied: ``A lot 
of them were lying around our display studio. We put them in because 
people like to look at a window and say `I wonder what that means.''' 
In other words, as Doonan put it, ``Sometimes a trumpet is just a 
display prop.'' The ``Absolut Doonan'' ad is to appear in the November 
issues of these magazines, Lewis said: Allure, Chicago Social, In 
Style, Interview, New York, Out, Paper and W. Plans call for the ad 
to return in January, after the annual Absolut holiday ad, in other 
titles.
