The boyish Jaret Wright digs surfing and hip sideburns and stands 
before you with the kind of pudgy cheeks that grandmothers would take 
a number to pinch. This is where the innocence ends. In many corners 
of the Yankee clubhouse, Wright is viewed as more nasty than naive, 
more reckless than rambunctious. The animosity toward him has less 
to do with Wright's overnight success against the Yankees in the division 
series last year than with a spring-training incident that still elicits 
shudders. Seven months ago, the Indians' right-hander whipped a fastball 
high and inside that broke Luis Sojo's left hand when he ducked. Sojo 
stood in front of his locker Monday afternoon _ a day before Wright's 
Game _ 1 start for the Cleveland Indians against the Yankees in the 
American League Championship Series _ and knew exactly what he would 
tell Wright face to face. ``I'd say, `If you've got a problem with 
me, let's go at it,''' Sojo said. ``You don't throw at people's heads. 
I think you have to be a little cocky on the mound. You've got to 
intimidate because that's the only way to be a success. But I don't 
think that has anything to do with hitting people in the head.'' Just 
22, Wright has already managed to get under the Yankees' pinstripes. 
With Sojo in his memory, Paul O'Neill was inflamed by Wright on June 
19. After being hit with a pitch inside, O'Neill berated Wright as 
he trotted to first base. Just the mention of what happened to Sojo 
left the Yankee starter David Wells Monday to offer his disdain for 
pitchers who ``headhunt.''. At the core of this scorn, Wright did 
not try to make peace Monday, offering only a defiant response and 
a shrug of his broad shoulders. ``There is not much I can say,'' he 
said. ``I am out there to do my job. I don't think we need to turn 
this into anything more than it is. This is about the third time I 
have been asked about whether I am hitting people or not. I am out 
there trying to get outs. ``It is baseball, you know; people get hit 
sometimes. But it is nothing.'' It is something to the Yankees. Tuesday 
night, they will not be staring at the same charming kid who wandered 
onto the mound as a fresh-faced unknown one year ago and dismantled 
the Yankees with an overpowering fastball in Games 2 and 5 of the 
championship series. Wright has had his troubles since then. Although 
he went 2-1 against the Yankees this season _ one of only four pitchers 
to beat them twice _ Wright has not had a sterling first full year 
in the majors. For a while, Wright appeared to be basking in the glow 
of his playoff triumphs last year. In April, his earned run average 
ballooned to 6.23. Once Bartolo Colon began to blossom, Wright, perhaps 
feeling a little threatened, found a focus to go 6-1 until hitting 
another slide in July. Wright's sluggish ending to the season carried 
over against Boston in Game 1 of the division series. Wright pitched 
four and a third innings, and gave up six runs in Cleveland's only 
loss against Boston. In that game, Wright hit Darren Lewis on the 
helmet with a pitch. ``Jaret doesn't need to give up those three-run 
home runs,'' Manager Mike Hargrove said. ``That would help. When he 
threw against Boston, he was behind a lot and his fastball was up.'' 
That drifting fastball races toward a hitter at speeds of 98 miles 
an hour, a fact that is at the heart of the Yankees' quarrel with 
Wright. ``Jaret is a power pitcher,'' Hargrove said. ``For Jaret to 
be effective, he has to pitch inside. I certainly don't think that 
we should all get carried away in dragging out old grudges.'' Despite 
the swirl around his pitcher, Wright is Hargrove's only option to 
start Game 1. Normally a pitcher who finished the season 12-10 with 
a 4.72 e.r.a. is not the first one dropped in on a championship series. 
But the Indians have no ace. Time after time, they have failed to 
land a No. 1 pitcher for their rotation. Randy Johnson, Roger Clemens 
and Pedro Martinez have all escaped them. So it's up to Wright. He 
has stood undaunted before the Yankees before in the playoffs, and 
done so again in the regular season. Last year, he was the boyish 
unknown. This time, the Yankees know him all too well. ``Just win, 
and that will be the best revenge,'' Sojo said. ``Score runs, and 
win.''
