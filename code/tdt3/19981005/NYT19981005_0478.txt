Trevor Hoffman wanted to be a surfer when he was growing up in southern 
California, but he could not find a regular ride to the beach, so 
he concentrated on baseball. That is a good thing for the San Diego 
Padres, because Hoffman's 53 regular-season saves _ tops in the majors 
this year _ propelled them to the National League West division title, 
and his two saves in the first round of the playoffs helped them dispatch 
the Houston Astros and advance to the league championship series. 
``I'm in a situation where individual accomplishments come through 
team success,'' Hoffman said the other day. ``Especially in my role. 
Unless the team is winning and does the work prior to the ninth inning, 
it's useless to have someone like me down there. I'm the final product 
of a well-played game by the rest of our guys.'' The right-handed 
pitcher is also a candidate for the National League Cy Young award. 
Others are Kevin Brown, the Padres starter; Shane Reynolds and Randy 
Johnson of Houston, and John Smoltz, Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux of 
Atlanta. Hoffman has been as good as automatic for the Padres, who 
play the Braves for the National League title beginning Wednesday 
in Atlanta. His 53 saves came in 54 opportunities, and he had a 1.50 
earned run average. He also won four games. In 72 innings, he allowed 
only 41 hits and struck out 85. Opponents batted only .167 against 
him. In the playoffs he had two saves, striking out the side in the 
ninth inning of the Padres' Game 3 victory. He faltered in Game 2, 
giving up the winning hit to Billy Spiers. ``Trevor is the best-prepared 
player,'' said Dave Stewart, the Padres' pitching coach and the most 
valuable player in the 1990 and 1993 American League Championship 
Series. ``I think Trevor Hoffman is an MVP candidate,'' said Stewart, 
arguing that Hoffman is practically an everyday player. ``You don't 
grow him once in a blue moon.'' Only four other pitchers have made 
the 50-save club: Bobby Thigpen had 57 for the Chicago White Sox in 
1990, Randy Meyers had 53 for the Chicago Cubs in 1993, Dennis Eckersley 
had 51 for the Oakland A's in 1992, and Rod Beck had 51 for the Cubs 
this year. Hoffman played shortstop and third base before switching 
to reliever in 1991 at Class A Cedar Rapids, and he is accustomed 
to the relief pitcher's place in the recesses of people's minds. ``The 
only time we get a whole lot of scrutiny is when we don't do our job, 
which is a lot of credit to our position,'' he said. ``If we do our 
job well, it rolls into the next game. If I don't do my job well, 
it takes a win from the ball club and takes the wind out of our sails.'' 
Over the years, Hoffman has developed a relief pitcher's equanimity 
and tough skin. ``This is a marathon,'' he said. ``Can't get too high 
or too low. It's easy to be negative. But you have to stand up for 
the way the game should be played and play your hardest.'' That is 
the how Hoffman has always played, since growing up the youngest of 
three brothers in Anaheim, Calif. Baseball was the family way: his 
father, Eddie, who died in 1995 at age 82, was known as the Singing 
Usher at Anaheim Stadium, and his brother Glenn was the interim manager 
of the Los Angeles Dodgers until the Dodgers decided last week not 
to make him the manager. Glenn Hoffman, still on the Dodgers' coaching 
staff, played as a utility infielder for the Boston Red Sox, the Dodgers 
and the Anaheim Angels. ``All of the boys were only allowed to pitch 
when we were 12 years old,'' Trevor Hoffman recalled. ``My dad didn't 
want anyone to abuse our arms. I had a strong family background and 
a lot of competition from my older brothers. I was constantly bugging 
them to let me into their games.'' Hoffman has what teammates call 
a ``closer's personality.'' He loves being a star, he is a leader 
in the clubhouse, and he loves coming in with the game on the line. 
His teammates toss him the ball from the final out of each save, he 
records the date and score in black marker, and he puts it in a cupboard 
in his locker next to the pictures of his two sons, Brody Burke Hoffman, 
2, and Quinn Eddie Hoffman, 1. ``He has fun with all of this,'' said 
Andy Ashby, the Padre starting pitcher. ``But he knows when it's time 
to come to play, and he's unbelievable. The perfect guy to be that 
locked-in mentally. The ninth inning is his time.''
