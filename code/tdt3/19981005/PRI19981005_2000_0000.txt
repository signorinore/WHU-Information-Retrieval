A co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH Boston. It's 
Monday October 5th. I'm Tony Kahn. Today, as the House Judiciary Committee 
considers opening an impeachment inquiry because of the Lewinsky affair, 
we wonder whether Congress is dropping the ball on foreign affairs. 
Well, I think it's pretty clear that nothing is going on there. Whenever 
you have a split Congress, inaction tends to be the rule of the day. 
And an Australia researcher examines the physics of hitting. I went 
out and bought a Louisville Slugger, I think it was and I wanted to 
investigate what the sweet spot was on a baseball bat. First this 
news.
