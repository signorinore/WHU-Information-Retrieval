From National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm Cory Flintoff. 
The House Judiciary Committee has voted to open an impeachment inquiry 
on President Clinton. The resolution passed just minutes ago on a 
straight party line vote. NPR's Chitra Rogaman's been watching the 
committee meeting and she's live with us here in the studio. Chitra, 
tell us about this historic vote. Cory, Republicans pushed through 
the resolution 21-16 strictly along party lines and this vote came 
after a day long intense and often partisan debate on whether or not 
to conduct such a form of inquiry. This afternoon, after all 37 members 
had made their opening remarks, counsel for both sides stated their 
case for and against such an investigation. The Republican investigator 
said look, there are over 15 grounds for possible impeachment, but 
the Democratic counsel said that these charges did not add up to a 
constitutional crisis. Republicans then defeated along party lines 
two amendments by Democrats to restrict the scope, timing and length 
of the inquiry. Thank you, NPR's Chitra Rogaman.
