There will be no trial in the case of a 15-year-old boy accused of 
opening fire on a prayer group at his high school in West Paducah, 
Kentucky. The gun fire left three students dead and five others wounded. 
From member station WKMS in Murray, Kentucky, Laurie Barrett reports. 
Just moments before Michael Corneil's trial was to open, a plea agreement 
was reached. Under the agreement, Corneil pleaded guilty but mentally 
ill to three counts of murder and five counts of attempted murder. 
The prosecution has recommended the maximum sentence of life without 
parole for 25 years. commonwealth attorney Tim Kalpenback said he 
had a very strong case against the defendant and Corneil's family 
didn't want to put themselves, the victims or the witnesses through 
a trial. Corneil's attorney, Chuck Grainer said his client deeply 
regrets the pain, injury and loss of life his actions had caused. 
He says Corneil admits full responsibility and accepts the maximum 
penalty. Formal sentencing is scheduled for December 16th. For NPR 
News, I'm Laurie Barrett in Murray, Kentucky.
