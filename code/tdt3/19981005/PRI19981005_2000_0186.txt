The United Nations and NATO say that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
has not kept his promises to comply with the UN Security Council resolution 
on the Serbian province of Kosovo. UN Secretary General Koffi Annan 
told the Security Council today that Yugoslav security forces are 
responsible for most of the atrocities in Kosovo. He said the Yugoslav 
police have done little to withdraw their forces from the province. 
NATO Secretary-General Havier Salanas said the alliance is prepared 
to take military action if Milosevic fails to abide by the Security 
Council resolution.
