On the first day of its new term, the Supreme Court sided with a rural 
school district's right to conduct random drug tests on all students 
involved in extra curricular activities. NRP's Craig Windom reports. 
The justices, without comment, let stand a Federal appeals court ruling 
that said such testing does not violate a student's right to privacy. 
The case involved a high school in Indiana which adopted the drug 
testing program two years ago, although there was little evidence 
of drug use among its students. The program was challenged by several 
students and parents. But the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
ruled against them, saying that successful extra curricular activities 
require healthy students. The Supreme Court action upholding that 
ruling sets no national precedent, but it leaves in place a court 
decision that is binding in three states: Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin. 
An official with the National School Boards Association says she does 
not expect the court action to lead to a wave of new drug testing 
programs in public schools. Craig Windom, NRP News, Washington.
