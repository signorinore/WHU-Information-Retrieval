The National Basketball Association has cancelled all its remaining 
pre-season games because of a labor dispute with players. League officials 
have already cancelled 24 pre-season games. Today's announcement means 
the remaining 90 have been called off as well. Deputy NBA Commissioner 
Russ Granig said the teams can't possibly be ready to play any games 
before November. The team owners are demanding a limit on players' 
salaries, something the union opposes. This is NPR News.
