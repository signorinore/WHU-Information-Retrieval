China today signed the UN international covenant on civil and political 
rights. But whether this step is designed to improve China's human 
rights record or merely its image, remains to be seen. China signed 
a similar covenant last year on economic, social and cultural rights, 
but has yet to ratify it. In theory, today's signing of the UN covenant 
means China will guarantee freedom of speech and assembly as well 
as allow participation in elections. I think it is sigficant that 
China is signing the covenant but we must see this only as beginning, 
rather than the culmination of the process. William Alfred directs 
the east Asian legal studies program at Harvard Law School. He believes 
the process of implementing the human rights principles could take 
years. To bring this kind of document fully to life one needs the 
comforting dimensions of civil society. One needs an open media that 
is free to report on abuses. One needs recognition that citizens capacity 
to organize independently and call the government to task and there 
are some signs that, modest initial signs of each of these things. 
But we clearly don't want to overstate them. It's still at a rather 
early point. Other human rights monitors, including Human Rights Watch 
and Amnesty International hail China's initiative today as welcome 
news, but they warn that it's only when the covenant words are reflected 
in good practice that China should be recognized. We do have serious 
concerns about the commitment of Chinese government. Shau Chun is 
the executive director of watchdog group Human Rights in China, based 
in New York. He says it's now up to the international community to 
closely monitor how China implements the covenant and to support China's 
democracy activists. I think it has a impact which is giving them 
more confidence and giving their activities more legitimacy and more 
political space. But as far as China's government domestic policy 
on those activities which is still very repressive, have not seen 
any changes so far. Despite the signing ceremony at the United Nations, 
Chinese police today detained a dissident for three hours and reportedly 
warned him against trying to set up a human rights monitoring group 
in Beijing.
