Well, later in our program, we'll explore a new Amnesty International 
report that finds a widespread pattern of rights abuses in America. 
This is PRI, Public Radio International. The world is sponsored by 
the Capital Group companies investing throughout the world for individuals 
and institutions. And the world is sponsored by Merck, dedicated to 
the needs of society through pharmaceutical research and consumer 
education to improve the quality of life. Merck, committed to bringing 
out the best in medicine. You are listening to the world on 91 FM. 
Coming up on tonight's program, reports on election results in Brazil. 
And the world's Clark Boyd reports on Australian research into the 
sweet spot of the baseball bat, where hitters try to make contact. 
Also, business news from New York and the daily geography quiz. That's 
what's coming up on the world, but first, here's the Franklin Institute 
forecast. Some clearing this evening, low 46. Tomorrow, Tuesday, partly 
sunny and warmer than today, high 67.
