Global markets fall on the absence of a battle plan to solve the international 
financial crisis. I'm Richard Griffin at the business desk in New 
York. It's been a morose Monday in markets worldwide amid disappointment 
at the outcome of the G-7 meeting in Washington at the weekend. It 
seems investors are worried about the disagreements among world leaders, 
about the need for coordinated action to stem a growing recession. 
Tokyo shares were first to tumble today, falling to their worst level 
in nearly 13 years. European stocks swiftly followed suit along with 
shares on Wall Street. Economist David Blitzer of Standard & Poor's 
says the absence of action though doesn't necessarily hasten the prospect 
of a recession here in the U.S. Our own estimate of the chance of 
recession are about two in five for the next year or so, or 40 percent. 
That's crept up a little bit in the last couple of months. But somehow 
or other, we had a big build up to these IMF meeting and expectation 
that we'd see some hard news and unfortunately, we didn't although 
I guess I should add, I'm not sure we ever see hard news out of the 
IMF annual meeting.
