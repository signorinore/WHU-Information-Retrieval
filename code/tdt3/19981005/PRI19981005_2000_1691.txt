The disappointments in global markets today spread to Brazil as investors 
there waited to see what reelected President Cardozo has in mind for 
the economy. Brazil's stock market, the Bovespa, was down around 5 
percent ahead of the close. The future for the country's economy has 
of course been a focus in Washington. David Blitzer says meetings 
there could still produce results. It will take a long time to seek 
a new direction or a new angle, but hopefully it's actually gotten 
started because there's clearly been a lot of ferment in the last 
month or two.
