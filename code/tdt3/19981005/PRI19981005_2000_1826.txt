For the world, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC news room in London. 
The House Judiciary Committee has decided to open an impeachment inquiry 
against President Clinton following the report into his affair with 
Monica Lewinsky. Mike A. Omar reports from Washington. The House Judiciary 
Committee voted strictly along partisan lines. All 21 Republicans 
voted in favor of an impeachment inquiry with no time limits and no 
limits on what issues or subjects it could look into. The 16 Democrats 
on the committee all voted against it. Democratic congressmen had 
tried to introduce resolutions which limited the time scale of an 
impeachment inquiry and which also limited the inquiry only on the 
issue of the affair between President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. 
However, they failed when Republicans, who form the majority on the 
committee voted the resolutions down., BBC News Washington.
