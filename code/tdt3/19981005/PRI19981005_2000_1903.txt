Brazilian President Fernando Enrique Cardozo appears to be on course 
for an outright victory in the first round of the country's presidential 
election. Here's the BBC correspondent in Sao Paulo, Steven Speech. 
So far President Cardozo has made no public statement about the election. 
However, there is no longer any doubt about the outcome. Mr. Cardozo 
will become the first Brazilian president to be reelected to a second 
successive term. Meanwhile, the coalition of left wing parties which 
supported the president's main challenger, Louis Inagnio Denanasova 
have issued a statement attacking both the government and the media 
for allegedly trying to manipulate the campaign. Mr. Cardozo will 
now want to push ahead with his austerity plans. None of this will 
be easy since he will need the support of Congress and of the country's 
powerful state governors. Steven Speech, BBC News, Sao Paulo.
