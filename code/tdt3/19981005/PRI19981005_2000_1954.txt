China has signed the United Nations international covenant on civil 
and political rights. It guarantees basic freedoms like the right 
to free speech, a fair trial and protection from torture. Chou Ching 
of the New York-based group, Human Rights in China, has welcomed the 
decision. It implies that Chinese government will make a commitment 
to recognize those universal human rights. It is also a diplomatic 
tactic. We have not seen an domestic policy changes towards those 
basic freedoms. Chou Ching.
