For today's geography quiz, we head to the center of Africa and we 
set up camp in the Sahara desert. Now that brings to mind endless 
vistas of shifting sands. Think again. This part of the Sahara in 
northwest Chad is home to the desert's highest mountain range and 
that's what we're looking for. There's still active volcanos here, 
along with therapeutic springs of sulfuric water. And not that we're 
talking Club Med, Club Dead would be more like it. Temperatures here 
can reach 120 degrees. Though severely isolated the mountains here 
have sparked the interests of scientists who are drawn to their prehistoric 
rock carvings depicting hippopotamuses and elephants, grazing on open 
plains. UFO enthusiasts are interested in the large headed figures 
in these drawings which they interpret as space helmets. Maybe you 
agree. One word of caution. If you're thinking of traveling here, 
the local Tubu people who have lived here for at least 2500 years 
are not especially keen on vistors. What's the name of our mysterious 
mountains? Stay tuned. We'll reveal the name in a few minutes.
