Commentator Boris Maximoff can always be counted on to come up with 
le mot juste, just the right word for the occasion. But it's getting 
tougher every day. OK, enough. I know that America gave us such wonders 
as computer code. I am fully aware that Mr. Morse as in Morse code 
was an American. We've all heard that Washington is worried about 
encryption techniques, but isn't it pushing things just a bit too 
far when you need a code book or two to decipher the evening news? 
When the headlines breathlessly mention the Y2K problem, the future 
401 plans, arrests are being made for DUI or even BUI what is wrong 
with plain English or Spanish or Tagalog, anything as long as it is 
a language and not a code for the initiated. Trust me, I'm not exaggerating. 
It took me a year to figure out that RV was not a particularly painful 
medical procedure. I'm still not sure what K through 12 actually means 
except for the fact that it has something to do with children. Only 
today, one of my colleagues opened my eyes to the fact that JR is 
a character from a soap opera, while JD is a law degree, not to be 
confused with a DJ of course. And that leaves ER to be figured out 
or is it E or? And how about air travel? You get on the plane in JFK 
and land in LAX and that acronym by the way always reminds me of laxatives 
or even smoked salmon. And people aren't driving any more from one 
identifiable place to another, oh no. Now you go north from I-93, 
then get on an I-89, get off onto route 23 and stop on the corner 
of Fifth and 17th just in front of K-mart. Is that supposed to mean 
anything to people? Alphabet soup in a weird are everywhere, on street 
corners in immigrant neighborhoods in the eight congressional district 
people discuss knowledgeably the advantages of H1B versus I-20 or 
even J-1. The middle class has known about their 1040s. Sports bars 
are alive with conversations about RBI and who had 15k's last night. 
CEOs get a bit of R&R on the T. LPs are out. CDs are in. Q&A, SOP, 
TLC, STD, SDI, URL, SWF searching for BM that is DDF. Has the entire 
country joined a secret society that decided that ritual handshakes 
are passe and coded language is a much more effective way to confuse 
the outsiders. UNINTELLIGIBLE) BMOC, Boris Maximoff a regular contributor 
to the world and that's OK with this person who is IOU on his 401.
