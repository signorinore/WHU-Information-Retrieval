And now we return to the Sahara desert for the answer to today's geography 
quiz. We're looking for a mountain range, remember, situated in the 
northwest corner of Chad and home to sulfuric springs as well as some 
intriquing prehistoric rock carvings depicting hippopotamuses and 
elephants grazing on open plains as well as some large headed figures 
that some UFO enthusiasts interepret as space helmets. The answer 
is the Tibet Sea mountain range where the local Tubu people have been 
living for more than 2500 years. You're listening to PRI, Public Radio 
International.
