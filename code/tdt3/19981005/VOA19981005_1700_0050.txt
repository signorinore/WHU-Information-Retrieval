I'm Robert Burns, VOA News. The house judiciary committee is halting 
a headed and highly partisan debate on whether a formal impeachment 
inquiry against President Clinton is warranted. The panel dominated 
by Republicans is expected to approve a resolution for an open-ended 
probe into the President's conduct. Addressing the panel are Republican's 
chief lawyer, David Shippers, detailed 15 counts of perjury, obstruction 
of justice and other alleged crimes by the President in his attempts 
to conceal an affair with Monica Lewinski. That is four more grounds 
for impeachment than originally by alleged by prosecutor Ken Starr, 
at one point, Mr. Shippers quoted British statesman, Sir Thomas Moore. 
The laws of this country are the great barriers that protect the citizens 
from the swoons of evil and tyranny. If we permit one of those laws 
to fall, who will be able to stand in the winds that follow? The democrats' 
lawyer, Abby Powell, accused Mr. Shippers of subdividing existing 
allegations. He said it all amounts to lying about sex and, in his 
words, impeachment requires a much higher threshold. Earlier, all 
37 committee members had their chance to speak about the President's 
conduct and the investigation. Republican Congressman Lindsey Graham 
of South Carolina said he was undecided how to vote. I don't know 
if censure is appropriate. We should just drop or we should throw 
him out of office. Nobody knows yet, in my opinion, who has really 
got an open mind about this thing. Is this Watergate or Peyton Place? 
As the debate opened, a White House spokesman appealed to congress 
to give the president a fair, prompt, and nonpartisan hearing. But 
with Republicans dominating the committee, there is little chance 
the Democrats can shape the outcome. A probe is expected shortly after 
the November elections.
