U.S. Envoy, Richard Holbrooke, is in Belgrade to express to Yugoslav 
authorities that NATO air strikes are inevitable unless they comply 
with UN resolutions on Kosovo. Mr. Holbrooke met in Belgrade with 
the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic. President Clinton has 
described the latest Yugoslav response to the resolutions as inadequate. 
The Pentagon officials say Yugoslavia will have to do more than send 
a few troops to their barracks to avoid air strikes. The top U.S. 
officials say the Yugoslav government will also have to help the hundreds 
of thousands of people displaced by the fighting and start talks with 
the Kosovar Albanians. Correspondent Jim Randall reports from the 
Pentagon. Diplomats and journalists say Serb dominated forces are 
stopping their offensive against separatists Kosovar Albanians. Some 
Yugoslav forces including armored units are leaving the Serbian province 
while others are returning to barracks within Kosovo. The move follows 
NATO threats of air strokes on Yugoslav military targets in Kosovo, 
if attacks continue against ethnic Albanians. The threats took on 
a more urgent tone as reports reached the West that Serb forces were 
executing dozens of villagers in the province. Pentagon spokesman, 
Ken Bacon, says Yugoslavia must also meet UN Security Council demands 
to start talks with Kosovar Albanians, help refugees return home, 
and allow relief efforts to begin. Mr. Bacon says there is no apparent 
progress on three of those four demands. Friday, U.S. Defense Secretary, 
William Cohen, said NATO air strikes could begin within two weeks 
and involve hundreds of aircraft. Jim Randall, VOA News, at the Pentagon.
