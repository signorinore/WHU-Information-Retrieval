The most senior economic official in the new government in Moscow 
says Russia is demanding that the International Monetary Fund continue 
making loans to his country. We have a report from VOA's Moscow correspondent, 
Peter Heimline. First Deputy Prime Minister, Yuri Masticoff says the 
IMF helped get Russia into its current financial crisis and must help 
it get out He said We did not fall into this pit all by ourselves, 
it was also thanks to the skillful help of our partners from the IMF. 
He said, so there is only one path, we must be helped, and we demand 
this help. He said the next $4.3 billion IMF loan installment is needed 
because Russia does not have enough money to bail itself out of its 
current economic crisis on its own. Mr. Masticoff's remarks on a nationally 
televised interview program came as two other senior government officials 
prepared for tough talks with the IMF in Washington. But the lending 
agency has made it clear the next loan installment would only be released 
only after Russia comes up with a firm commitment to continue on the 
path of reform. Peter Heimline, VOA News, Moscow.
