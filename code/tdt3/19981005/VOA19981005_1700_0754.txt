Meanwhile foreign ministers have agreed to close loopholes in their 
existing economic sanctions against Yugoslavia because of the violence 
in its Kosovo province. The move comes as NATO decides whether to 
order air strikes against Yugoslavia. Ministers of the 15 member countries 
meeting in Luxembourg declined to impose any new sanctions, but they 
agreed to broaden the freeze on assets to recover Yugoslavia's state-owned 
companies and extend the ban on visas to Serbian officials.
