The government in opposition in troubled Asuto has agreed to consider 
a transitional structure that would pave the way to free and fair 
elections within 18 months. Among other things, the structure would 
set rules for election campaigning and insure free treatment by state-owned 
media. It would also appoint a new independent electoral commission 
to review Asuto's electoral system.
