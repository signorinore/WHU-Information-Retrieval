Here in the United States, powerful storms have lashed the Kansas 
City area, in the Midwestern state of Missouri, causing floods that 
drowned five people, roads, businesses, and schools around the city 
have been closed as creeks and lakes in the area overflow. Meanwhile, 
a series of tornadoes rolled through central Oklahoma Sunday night 
injuring 13 people. The twisters damaged buildings and knocked out 
power to several homes.
