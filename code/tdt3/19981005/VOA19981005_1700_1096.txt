Major League Baseball's San Diego Padres have advanced to the National 
League Championship series for the first time since 1984 with a six 
to one home victory over the Houston Astros on Sunday. Houston pitching 
ace, Randy Johnson pitched well and lasted six innings on the mound 
but suffered his fifth straight playoff loss. Sterling Hitchcock was 
the winning pitcher in his first post season start. The Padres' Tony 
Gwenn says it was a good series. We ended up blowing this one out 
late but all four games, very interesting games, great pitching. Tonight 
is the only time the whole series really hit the ball good. You know 
and then in one inning, we strung together some hits but I'm happy. 
You know, I do not want to go off the deep end, I think. Because there 
is still a lot of work to be done. San Diego begins its series against 
the Braves Wednesday night in Atlanta. The Braves swept the Chicago 
Cubs to reach the National League Championship Series for the seventh 
straight year.
