The Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League have defeated 
the Seattle Seahawks for the seventh straight time in a match that 
was interrupted by a violent storm. Lightning in the Kansas City area 
Sunday night forced the players off the field for nearly an hour during 
the second quarter. The game official who called for the delay said 
the lightning was too close to Arrowhead stadium to take a chance 
on anyone's safety. Players rushed to their locker rooms and fans 
crowded stadium halls and open spaces as the storm soaked the field 
with almost five centimeters of rain. But receiver Andre Risen of 
the Chiefs says the rain helped his team. It brought our team closer 
because it was like from high school stuff, you know, tornado warnings, 
going to the basement, then you got to go back out into the tornado. 
I mean it was funny, it was the first time I felt like I was playing 
with a team that was-of last year. When the game finally resumed, 
the two sides traded punts and turn-overs on a soggy field before 
the chiefs pulled out a 17 to 6 victory.
