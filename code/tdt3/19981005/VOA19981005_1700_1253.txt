Brazil's national football team will get a chance to avenge its World 
Cup final loss to France when the two teams meet in the opening match 
of the Confederation's Cup this January. The tournament will get under 
way at Hillisco Stadium in Guadalajara, Mexico on January 8. Brazil 
is the defending champion and has been drawn into group B along with 
France, the United States, and New Zealand. Group A is comprised of 
Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Bolivia and, Egypt. Those matches will be played 
at Aztec Stadium in Mexico City. But European football's leading professional 
clubs voted last week to boycott the tournament which conflicts with 
most team schedules. Football's world governing body, FIFA has announced 
it will look into alternative dates for the two-week tournament.
