the international cycling union says three Swiss riders involved in 
a doping scandal during the Tour de France have had their suspensions 
reduced by one month. The three riders, Alec Zewell, Arman Myer, and 
Loran DuFoe were all members of the Pristina team. They were suspended 
for eight months and fined over $2,200 by the Swiss cycling federation 
last week. With the reduction of their suspensions, they will be able 
to return to competition on May 1, 1999. And that is a look at sports.
