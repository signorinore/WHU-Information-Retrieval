Time now, Tom, to talk a little bit about frequencies. If you are 
listening to us in Oceania or the Pacific, you can consider switching 
over right now to 9.705 megahertz, short wave. We are broadcasting 
on that now from 21 hours to 0 hours, universal time. You know, we 
would be very happy to mail you a frequency schedule, but we need 
your name and your address, not your e-mail address, but your regular 
home address or office address. Send your name and address to VOA, 
Voice of America, Washington, D.C. 20547, U.S.A. or you can e-mail 
us the information. That's address for our e-mail is newsnow@voa.gov 
and in this case newsnow is just one word. It is 21 hours, 30 universal 
time and this is VOA News Now.
