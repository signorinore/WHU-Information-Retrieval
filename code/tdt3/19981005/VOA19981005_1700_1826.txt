I am Pat Bodner, VOA News. The House Judiciary Committee is holding 
a heated and highly partisan debate on whether a formal impeachment 
inquiry against President Clinton is warranted. The panel, dominated 
by Republicans, is expected to approve a Republican resolution for 
an open-ended probe into the President's conduct. More from VOA's 
Paula Wolfsen. The Republicans won an inquiry free of limits on scope 
and duration. Georgia Congressman Bob Barr borrows a phrase made famous 
during the Watergate scandal of 1974. We are witnessing nothing less 
than the symptoms of a cancer on the American Presidency. Democrats 
say while Bill Clinton made big mistakes, it is not fair to compare 
his wrong-doings to those committed by Richard Nixon. Michigan Congressman, 
John Conyors, sat on the Judiciary Committee during the Watergate 
inquiry. This is not Watergate. It is an extramarital affair. Republicans 
have the votes to push a recommendation for an open-ended inquiry 
through the committee. The full House votes later in the week. Paula 
Woflson, VOA News, Capital Hill.
