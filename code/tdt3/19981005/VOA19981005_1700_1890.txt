U.S. Envoy, Richard Holbrooke, is in Belgrade to stress to Yugoslav 
authorities that NATO air strikes are inevitable, unless they comply 
with UN resolutions on Kosovo. Mr. Holbrooke was meeting in Belgrade 
with Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic. President Clinton has 
described the latest Yugoslav response to the resolutions as inadequate. 
At the United Nations, Secretary General, Copi Anan, said fighting 
has continued in Kosovo unabated since his last report on the crisis 
in early September. The head of the UN Refugee Agency says the international 
community must do more to end the displacement of people from their 
homes. Sadaka Ogata estimates there are 22 million refugees worldwide. 
Many fleeing violence in their homelands. She urges European countries 
to keep their borders open to asylum seekers, especially from Kosovo. 
Asylum remains the cornerstone of refugee protection. I am very worried 
that in industrialized societies, but increasingly also in the European 
countries, governments adopt more restrictive asylum policies resorting 
to a narrow interpretation of refugee law. The UN official demanded 
nations protect refugees.
