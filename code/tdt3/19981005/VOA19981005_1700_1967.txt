Turkey is warning Syria that it does not have time for anything but 
a quick end to alleged Syrian support for Kurd rebels fighting Turkey 
for a separate homeland. Turkish foreign minister Ishmael Gemm made 
the statement Monday amid Turkish media reports the army is ready 
to act against alleged Turkish-Kurd bases in Syria. More from correspondent 
Abrin Zemon in Anchora. Turkish officials continue to voice anger 
over what they call serious continued support for rebels of the separatists 
Kurdistan Workers' Party the PKK and the Turkish press is speculating 
that Turkey will soon take military action against its Arab neighbor. 
Turkish President Sulay Mondineral said Turkey is not only warning 
Syria, but the whole world of the consequences Damascus would face 
if it fails to stop aiding the PKK and the groups in either of the 
who lives in Damascus. Syria denies it aids the PKK. Mr. Demurral 
says Syria's actions are not in his words commensurate with either 
Islam, or fraternity. Mr. Demurral is expected to tell Mr. Mobarad 
Tuesday that Turkey reserves the right to take military action unless 
Syria hands over the PKK leader and shuts down all PKK camps in Syria 
and in the Syrian-controlled Pakar Valley in Lebanon. Abrin Zemon,
