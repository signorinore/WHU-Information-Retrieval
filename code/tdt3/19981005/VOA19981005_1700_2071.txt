Finance ministers from industrialized and developing nations are meeting 
in Washington today to discuss the worsening global financial situation. 
The 22-nation group has urged greater openness by all countries, tougher 
banking regulations and consideration of making investors pay for 
their own mistakes rather than be bailed out. The group issued three 
separate reports, which will be reviewed later today in a meeting 
attended by President Clinton.
