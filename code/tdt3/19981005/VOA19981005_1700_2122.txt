The rebels in Congo Canshasa have backed away from their claim to 
have marched into the government stronghold in the east. A rebel spokesman 
says his fighters are nearing the town of Kindu but they have not 
reached it. Earlier, the government said it was in firm control of 
Kindu and the town was quiet. The rebels say they are now encamped 
in nearby Kalema. You are listening to VOA News, I am Pat Bodner in 
Washington.
