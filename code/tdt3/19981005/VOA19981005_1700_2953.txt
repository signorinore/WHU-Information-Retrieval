Time now for business news. U.S. share prices closed lower Monday 
after a weekend meeting of world financial officials failed to ease 
concern over slowing global economic growth. Breck Ardrate reports 
from New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 7,726 down 
58 points. The Standard and Poors 500 index closed at 988, down 14 
points. During the day's trading, the industrial average twice dropped 
by more than 200 points but made a strong recovery in the last hour 
of trading. A recovery which analysts say was largely fueled by futures-related 
buying and other technical factors. Analysts say the fund metals still 
look gloomy. There is ongoing worry on Wall Street about international 
financial problems and some disappointment that the weekend meeting 
of finance ministers from major industrialized nations did not come 
up with a new program to ease the situation. Breck Ardrate, VOA News, 
New York.
