Finance ministers from 22 industrial and developing countries met 
Monday here in Washington to discuss reforms here in the monetary 
system. But as Barry Wood reports, there is not yet a consensus on 
what those reforms should be. Top officials are coming to the view 
that sudden shifts of billions of dollars between financial markets 
can be disruptive. There is particular concern about the so-called 
hedge funds. Highly speculative investment that used borrowed money 
to bet on rises and falls of currencies. Dominique Strausscon the 
economy minister of France says hedge funds behave as if the world 
financial market is a casino. The is not to close the casino. I mean 
you may have a casino and you have really good news to run the casino. 
The problem is not the existence of the casino, but the fact that 
the rules are almost nonexistent. And what we say is that we need 
more regulation. Mr. Strausscon has been making his case for more 
regulation at the Washington meetings of the group of seven finance 
ministers as well as at the International Monetary Fund. Another policy 
maker who favors more regulation is Donald Zon, the financial secretary 
of Hong Kong. Mr. Zon says Hong Kong's economy has shifted from five 
percent growth in 1997 to a projected four percent decline this year. 
Mr. Zon says speculative capital flows can be particularly damaging 
to Hong Kong during this period of rapid transition. What we do not 
want to happen is someone will come to you because you are on an economic 
downswing to turn a rapid economic adjustment into a meltdown. Particularly, 
I am talking about those small number of hedge funds. I am not talking 
about hedge funds generally. I am talking about these so-called hedge 
funds whose sole intention is to topple a currency of a country in 
which it has no investment. A group of 22 economies including France 
and Hong Kong, have participated in the preparation of studies on 
reforming the financial system. Those ideas are being vigorously debated 
here in Washington. Officials say that consensus on long-term reform 
is unlikely to emerge soon. However, some short-term measures may 
be announced in the next few days. Barry Wood, VOA News, Washington.
