There is also word that a new novel by the late Ernest Hemmingway 
will be published next July. To coincide with the centennial of his 
birth. True at First Light has been described as the last major unpublished 
work by the American writer who died in 1961. It is an unfinished 
fictional memoir about an African safari, featuring a main character 
much like Hemingway, himself. Not everyone is happy about the upcoming 
book. Washington Post literary critic, Jonathan Yardley noted in a 
recent column that this will be the fifth posthumous Hemmingway work 
published by scribers. And he believes those books have not shown 
the author at his best. Hemmingway could have brought them out in 
his lifetime if he wanted to says Jonathan Yardley. And to make them 
available after his death is to diminish the author's literary reputation.
