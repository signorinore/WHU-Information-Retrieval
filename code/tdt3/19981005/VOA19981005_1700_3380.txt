And finally, another Washington Post writer, film critic Steven Hunter, 
spends a lot of time watching movies. But he has also managed to write 
eight novels including a new thriller called Time to Hunt. It is the 
third in a series he has done about a Vietnam veteran and a master 
sniper haunted by his wartime experiences. Steven Hunter says from 
an early age, he knew he wanted both to write fiction and review movies. 
And he believes he thinks in pictures when he writes. But while films 
have influenced his writing, he says it would be hard to make his 
novels into movies. They are usually built around what I hope would 
be fantastic action sequences in movies, but these sequences are usually 
mounted in plots that are almost impossible for screenwriters to decipher. 
The plots are too complicated. They are not movie plots. They are 
book plots. Hidden motivations, family ties, sources of guilt and 
courage. Those are the kinds of subject Steven Hunter believes a novel 
gives him the chance to explore at length. That is all for Book Briefs.
