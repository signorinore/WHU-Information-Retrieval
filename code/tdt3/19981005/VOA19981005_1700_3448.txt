Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break. You are listening to VOA News Now. We are coming 
up on 22 hours universal time which means we are saying goodnight 
to most of our listeners in the Middle East and North Africa. Thanks 
for being with us and tune in again tomorrow beginning at four hours 
universal time. VOA News Now resumes at 7.17, 11.965 and 15.205 megahertz 
short wave. If you are listening in the Persian Gulf area right now, 
we invite you to stay with us for another couple of hours on medium 
wave at 1548 kilohertz. And if you are listening in the Eastern Mediterranean, 
we will be back on the air with VOA News Now 30 minutes from now on 
1260-kilohertz medium wave. Here is a frequency change if you are 
listening in Africa. We are now going off 15.41, 15.445, 15.58 and 
17.725 megahertz short wave. We invite you to retune to 7.34 megahertz 
or any of our other remaining frequencies. For listeners in Europe, 
we are now going off WRN1 via Astral. We will resume broadcasting
