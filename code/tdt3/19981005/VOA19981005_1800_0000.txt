-- to launch formal impeachment proceedings against President Clinton. 
While the Judiciary Committee is debating his fate as U.S. president, 
Mr. Clinton is concentrating on the business of government. He spoke 
on the phone with Russian President Boris Yeltsin on the subject of 
Kosovo and we'll have a report. Also, the head of UNICEF is trying 
to persuade an African government and the rebels trying to overthrow 
it to demobilize all child soldiers. I'm Teresa Erickson. And I'm 
Tony Riggs. We'll have details on those stories, sports, business 
news and hear about a new biography of the heroic but controversial 
aviator, Charles Lindbergh. That and more ahead in this hour of VOA 
News now. First, a summary of world news. I'm Robert Burns, VOA News.
