The U.S. House Judiciary Committee is nearing a decision on whether 
to recommend a formal impeachment inquiry of President Clinton's alleged 
wrongdoings. Late Monday the committee defeated a Democratic proposal 
to limit the anticipated probe to the Monica Lewinsky matter and impose 
strict time limits on it. The Republican dominated panel is expected 
to vote for an unlimited inquiry as early as tonight to approve the 
inquiry by the end of the week. Earlier in the day, the committee's 
Republican investigator, David Schiffers, suggested increasing the 
number of charges leveled against Mr. Clinton from 11 to 15. They 
include perjury and obstruction of justice in attempts to conceal 
an affair with the former White House intern, Ms. Lewinsky. Committee 
Democrats rejected the accusation by saying the matter hardly rises 
to the level of an impeachable offense because it comes down to extramarital 
sex.
