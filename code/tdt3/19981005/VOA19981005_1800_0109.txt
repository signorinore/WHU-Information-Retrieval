With the Judiciary Committee hearing continuing, President Clinton 
is said to be focusing on the business of government, including the 
U.S. budget and the crisis in Kosovo. VOA's David Gullest reports 
from the White House. White House officials say there is no way the 
president can ignore the impeachment debate but they say his attention 
has been focused on other matters and as the hearings began he was 
taking a phone call from Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, on the 
Kosovo crisis. Mr. Clinton's new chief spokesman Joe Lockhart reiterated 
the White House stand that Mr. Clinton's admitted wrongdoing in the 
Monica Lewinsky affair does not approach an impeachable offense. He 
urged the Judiciary Committee to try to resolve the issue with speed 
and fairness. We think that that process should be fair. It should 
be nonpartisan. It should be focused on the Starr referral and it 
should have some sense of timing that will allow this process to end 
and put it behind us which is I think what the majority of the American 
public wants. Mr. Lockhart embraced a weekend appeal by former president 
Gerald Ford for a swift end to the matter through a Congressional 
censure of the president, calling Mr. Ford a voice of reason. David 
Gullest, VOA News, the White House.
