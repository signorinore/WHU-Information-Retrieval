The head of the UN refugee agency says the international community 
must do more to end the displacement of people from their homes. Sadako 
Ogata estimates there are 22 million refugees worldwide, many who 
are fleeing violence in their homelands. She said the situation is 
especially bad in Kosovo Province where a quarter of a million people 
have been forced to flee. Ms. Ogata says Serbian troops continue to 
use excessive force to subjudicate and terrorize the ethnic Albanian 
population.
