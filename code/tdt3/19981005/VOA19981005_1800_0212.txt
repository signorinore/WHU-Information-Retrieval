Pentagon officials say Yugoslavia will have to do more than send a 
few troops to their barracks to avoid threatened NATO air strikes 
in Kosovo. A top U.S. official says the Yugoslav government will also 
have to help the hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the 
fighting and start talks with Albanians. Correspondent Jim Randle 
has more from the Pentagon. Diplomats and journalists say Serb dominated 
forces are stopping their offensive against separatist Kosovar Albanians. 
Some Yugoslav forces, including armored units, are leaving the Serbian 
province while others are returning to barracks within Kosovo. The 
move follows NATO threats of air strikes on Yugoslav military targets 
in Kosovo if attacks continued against ethnic Albanians. The threats 
took on a more urgent tone as reports reached the west that Serb forces 
were executing dozens of villagers in the province. Pentagon spokesman 
Ken Bacon says Yugoslavia must also meet UN Security Council demands 
to start talks with Kosovar Albanians, help refugees return home and 
allow relief efforts to begin. Mr. Bacon says there's no apparent 
progress on three of those four demands. Friday, U.S. Defense Secretary 
Cohen said NATO air strikes could begin within two weeks and involve 
hundreds of aircraft. Jim Randle, VOA News at the Pentagon.
