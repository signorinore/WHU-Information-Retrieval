Turkey is warning Syria it does not have time for anything but a quick 
end to alleged Syrian support for Turkish Kurd rebels. Turkey's foreign 
minister made the statement Monday and Turkish media reported the 
Army is ready to act against alleged Turkish Kurd bases in Syria. 
The reports say Turkish planes could also strike against alleged Kurd 
bases in Lebanon. Egypt's president Hosni Mubarak is due in Onkora 
later today, after meeting Sunday with Syria's leader. Turkish officials 
say Mr. Mubarak must bring concrete Syrian proposals for acting against 
Kurd rebels.
