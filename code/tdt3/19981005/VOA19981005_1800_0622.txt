And as the House Judiciary Committee began its hearings on the possible 
impeachment of the president, Mr. Clinton himself was said to be concentrating 
on the business of government, including the crisis in Kosovo. President 
Clinton has expressed concern that Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic 
is not fully complying with the UN resolution aimed at ending the 
conflict in Kosovo. VOA's Deborah Tate reports Mr. Clinton made his 
comments in a phone call with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. White 
House spokesman Joe Lockhart says Mr. Yeltsin telephoned Mr. Clinton 
to brief him on a high level Russian delegation to Belgrade over the 
weekend. The Russians, traditional allies of the Serbs, are trying 
to head off NATO plans to use air strikes against Belgrade targets 
to enforce a UN resolution on Kosovo. That resolution includes calls 
for an immediate cease fire and a pull back of Serb security forces 
that have been linked to human rights abuses against ethnic Albanians. 
The Russians say Mr. Milosevic has made some progress in complying 
with the resolution but U.S. officials say the Yugoslav leader has 
only accomplished what they call half measures. Spokesman Lockhart 
says Mr. Clinton told his Russian counterpart Mr. Milosevic was making 
false promises designed to remove international pressure on him. The 
U.S. president also made note of a report from UN Secretary General 
Kofi Annan showing Mr. Milosevic and the Serbs have not yet met the 
terms of the UN resolution. Mr. Clinton said the Yugoslav president's 
compliance with UN requirements must be verifiable, tangible and irreversible 
according to Mr. Lockhart. What's important here is what President 
Milosevic does. He is the one now who can come into full compliance 
with the UN resolution or he can continue to make half statements, 
have some movement or not fulfill his promises, so that's what's important 
here. Mr. Clinton told Mr. Yeltsin he hopes the use of force will 
not be necessary but that what happens next depends on Mr. Milosevic. 
He also noted he had dispatched envoy Richard Holbrooke to Belgrade 
to emphasize the importance of immediately complying with the international 
community's demands. Deborah Tate, VOA News at the White House.
