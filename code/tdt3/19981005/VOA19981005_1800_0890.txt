The United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, is trying to persuade 
combatants in Sierra Leone to demobilize all soldiers under the age 
of 18. UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy, who recently visited 
the West Africa nation, says, no justification for using children 
as combatants. VOA correspondent Elaine Johannsen tells us more from 
UN headquarters in New York. Ms. Bellamy met only with government 
officials in Sierra Leone but she says her message about demobilizing 
the country's youngsters also applies to the rebels, supporters of 
the former military junta and to the West African troops who were 
pivotal in removing Sierra Leone's military from power earlier this 
year. No, I meant no distinction whatsoever. Children should not be 
used as combatants. Children shouldn't be used as messengers. Children 
shouldn't be used for sexual violence by whether they are rebels, 
whether they are government troops, whether they are Ecomog troops. 
There is nothing that justifies the use of children as combatants 
and in Sierra Leone or anywhere else. UNICEF Director Bellamy says 
she is trying to convince the Sierra Leone government to demobilize 
everyone under the age of 18 and put them back into some sort of educational 
environment. The convention on the rights of the child that came into 
force earlier this decade specifies that no youngster under the age 
of 15 should be pressed into military service. But that age limit 
was more a result of compromise rather than conviction by Western 
nations. It was a concession to get developing countries, mostly in 
Africa and the Middle East, to sign the treaty. UNICEF Director Bellamy 
recalls having talked with a number of youngsters during her visit 
to Sierra Leone. She says many were 14 years old. One boy thought 
he might be 11. He was not quite sure. Elaine Johannsen, VOA News, 
New York.
