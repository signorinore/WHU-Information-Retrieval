Right now it's time for sports and here's VOA's Jim Stevenson with 
the latest. Jim. Well, two undefeated NFC Central Division rivals 
will meet in the National Football League's weekly Monday night game 
shortly as the Green Bay Packers host the Minnesota Vikings. The Packers, 
who have won 25 straight games at Lambeau Field, are closing in on 
the NFL record of 27 home victories in a row. The record was set by 
the Miami Dolphins from 1971 through 1974. Vikings head coach Dennis 
Green says he thinks he knows how to break the Packer's home winning 
streak. Because they're such a fast break team with Brett Favre the 
quarterback, it's very difficult to have to go out and worry about 
defending the run and defending the pass and then be able to get yardage 
when they run the football. You have to try to get them in long yardage 
situations when they run and therefore, in turn, you focus on the 
pass. Well, good luck, Mr. Green. Both teams have started the season 
with four victories. It's the second time the Vikings have done it 
in the last three years. For the Packers, it's the first four no start 
in 32 years. The last time it happened, the legendary Vince Lombardi 
was coach and Green Bay finished a 12 and 2 season by clobbering the 
Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl I. The Packers have won the last 
three meetings between the two teams but Minnesota's coach has a 7 
and 5 record against Green Bay. Monday night, something has to give.
