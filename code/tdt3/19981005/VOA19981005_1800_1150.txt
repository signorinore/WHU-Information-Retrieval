The Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League have defeated 
the Seattle Seahawks for the seventh straight time in a match interrupted 
by a violent storm. Lightening in the Kansas City area forced the 
players off of the field for nearly one hour during the second quarter. 
The game official who called for the delay said the lightening was 
too close to Arrowhead Stadium to take a chance on anyone's safety. 
Players rushed to the locker rooms and fans crowded stadium halls 
and open spaces as the storm soaked the field with almost five centimeters 
of rain. But receiver Andre Rison says the Chiefs --said that the 
rain helped his team. It brought our team closer because it was like 
some high school stuff. You know, tornado warning, go in the basement 
and then you gotta go back out into the tornado. I mean, it was funny. 
It was the first time I felt like I was playing with the team of last 
year. When the game finally resumed, the two sides traded punts and 
turnovers on a soggy field before the Chiefs pulled out a 17 to 6 
victory.
