Major League baseball San Diego Padres have advanced to the National 
League Championship series for the first time since 1984 with a 6 
to 1 home victory over the Houston Astros. The Padres opened the scoring 
in the second inning Sunday with another post-season home run by Jim 
Layritz. A Houston fielding error in the sixth inning allowed another 
San Diego score before the Padres broke the game wide open with four 
runs in the eighth inning. Houston pitching ace Randy Johnson lasted 
six innings on the mound and suffered his fifth straight playoff loss. 
Sterling Hitchcock was the winning pitcher in his first post-season 
start. The Padres' Tony Gwynn says it was it was a good series. We 
ended up blowing this one out late but, you know, all four games, 
very interesting games, great pitching. Tonight's the only time the 
whole series really hit the ball good, you know, in that one inning. 
We hit some I don't want to go off the deep end, I think, because 
still a lot of work to be done. San Diego begins its series against 
the Braves, Wednesday night in Atlanta. The Braves swept the Chicago 
Cubs on Saturday to reach the National League Championship Series 
for the seventh straight year. In the American League, the Cleveland 
Indians head for New York for game one of the American League Championship 
Series with the Yankees on Tuesday.
