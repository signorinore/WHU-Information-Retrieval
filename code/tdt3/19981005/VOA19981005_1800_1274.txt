The National Basketball Association has wiped out the remainder of 
its exhibition schedule because of stalled labor negotiations with 
players. NBA Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik says the league is not 
ready to play any games because of what he describes as the lack of 
any meaningful talks. The next collective bargaining session is scheduled 
for Thursday in New York. The League says a decision concerning the 
possible cancellation of regular season games will be made next week. 
The NBA is the only major professional sports league that has never 
had a regular season game wiped out because of a labor dispute.
