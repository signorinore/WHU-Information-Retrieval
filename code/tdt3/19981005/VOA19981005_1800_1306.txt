Well, just when Prairie View thought things were turning around, this 
happens. The school's athletic program has been slapped with an indefinite 
suspension. The Southwestern Athletic Conference imposed the ban because 
Prairie View violated an earlier two game suspension of it's marching 
band. The band was embroiled in huge brawl with its counterpart from 
Southern University at half-time during a game on September the 19th. 
The latest suspension against Prairie View was also based on a letter 
from the school president which allegedly vowed that Prairie View 
would never play conference rival Southern again. Prairie View's football 
team finally won a game on October the 3rd, snapping an 80 game losing 
streak that dated back to 1989. That's sports. I'm Jim Stevenson.
