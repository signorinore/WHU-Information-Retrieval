This week marks the celebration of Sukkot, the Jewish holiday of Thanksgiving 
which traditionally was observed at harvest time. I'm Jim Metzner 
and this is the Pulse of the Planet presented by the American Museum 
of Natural History. Celebrating Sukkot involves building a Sukkah, 
a hut in which the family eats its meals during the week the holiday 
is observed. We're listening to the sounds of a Sukkah being constructed. 
This is a wonderful holiday and its origins are in the Bible where 
it was clearly agriculturally linked. Max Tiktin is Assistant Head 
of the Judaic Studies Program at George Washington University. It 
was a holiday which marked the onset of the late fallen winter with 
the rain season, and in that setting, in and out of the small villages 
and hamlets where people lived, they would build temporary housing 
which would be called Sukkot huts. In these huts, as it became ritualized 
at a later point, they lived for eight days at precisely the fall 
equinox. It was really a way of saying, we live out in the open, but 
we're sheltered by God's protection. So that when one builds a sukkah 
these days, the whole thing is temporary, but the most important part 
of the Sukkah is the roof. The roof must be one which gives you enough 
protection so that when you're sitting at the table inside the Sukkah, 
the raindrops that come in won't spoil your soup, but also it's got 
to have a roof which has got enough opening in it so that you can 
see the stars. Pulse of the Planet is presented by the American Museum 
of Natural History. I'm Jim Metzner.
