It's universal time and this is VOA News Now. A congressional committee 
debates whether to ask the full House of Representatives for authority 
to investigate impeachment charges against President Clinton. A presidential 
envoy is in Belgrade to personally warn Yugoslav President Milosevic 
he is risking NATO action in Kosovo. Those stories plus business news 
and more in our next half hour of VOA News now. Hello again from Washington. 
I'm Tony Riggs with Teresa Erickson and this is VOA News Now.
