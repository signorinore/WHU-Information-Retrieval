A day long debate is in brief recess on Capital Hill where the Judiciary 
Committee of the House of Representatives is taking the first step 
in what could be the impeachment of President Clinton. The committee 
is trying to decide the terms of a request to the full House for authority 
to investigate charges against Mr. Clinton. Mr. Clinton's fellow Democrats 
on the committee want to limit the scope and the length of any investigation, 
but the majority of Republicans note the impeachment inquiry run by 
the Democrats against the late President Nixon, 24 years ago, contained 
no such limits. In the end it is expected the Republican majority 
will prevail, both in the committee and on the House floor and a full 
fledged impeachment inquiry will be mounted.
