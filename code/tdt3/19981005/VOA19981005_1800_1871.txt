VOA's David Gullest reports, the White House is keenly aware of what's 
happening on Capital Hill. But Mr. Clinton is still trying to deal 
with some of the other matters that cross his desk. White House officials 
say Mr. Clinton cannot possibly ignore the impeachment debate, but 
they say most of his attention has been focused on other matters. 
And as the hearings began, he was taking a phone call from Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin on the Kosovo crisis. He later held a legislative 
strategy session with Democratic Congressional leaders and joined 
them in an appeal to majority Republicans to act on long delayed budget 
bills before Congress begins its scheduled election recess at the 
end of the week. Time is running short. The Congress has important 
work left to do. Pass the necessary spending bills to keep the government 
running. Save Social Security for future generations. Ensure a quality 
education for all our children. Protect America from the global economic 
turmoil. These are the priorities of the American people and they 
must be the priorities of Congress in these last days before the election. 
Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart, meanwhile, reiterated the White House 
stand that Mr. Clinton's admitted wrongdoing in the Monica Lewinsky 
affair does not approach an impeachable offense. He urged the Judiciary 
Committee to try to resolve the issue with speed and fairness. We 
think that that process should be fair. It should be nonpartisan. 
It should be focused on the Starr referral and it should have some 
sense of timing that will allow this process to end and put it behind 
us which is, I think, what the majority of the American public wants. 
Mr. Lockhart said that while Chairman Henry Hyde has a reputation 
for evenhandedness, the Judiciary Committee's handling of the impeachment 
issue thus far has been less than fair. He cited, in particular, what 
he said was it's gratuitous release of salacious material on the scandal 
gathered by special prosecutor Kenneth Starr. The spokesman embraced 
a weekend appeal from former President Gerald Ford for a swift end 
to the matter through a Congressional censure of the president, with 
Mr. Lockhart calling the Republican Mr. Ford a voice of reason in 
the current political debate. David Gullest, VOA News, the White House.
