Of continuing concern to the EU ministers and much of the rest of 
the world is a threat that the economic troubles now afflicting Asia 
and Russia will spread. It's the top topic at the current Washington 
meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The 
Russians are pressing the IMF to release the next installment of an 
emergency loan it had agreed to make. But the IMF says Russia must 
first make a firm commitment to reforms and not a return to Soviet 
styled command economy. VOA's Peter Heinlein reports, Russian's top 
economic official says the IMF is partly responsible for the mess 
Russia's economy is in. First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Mosliokof 
says the IMF helped get Russia into its current financial crisis and 
must help it get out. YURI MOSLIOKOF, FIRST DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER 
He said, "We did not fall into this pit all by ourselves. It was also 
thanks to the skillful help of our partners from the IMF." He said, 
"So there is only one path. We must be helped and we demand this help." 
He said the next $4.3 billion IMF loan installment is needed because 
Russia does not enough money to bail itself out of its current economic 
crisis on its own. Mr. Mosliokof's remarks on a nationally televised 
interview program came as two other senior government officials prepared 
for tough talks with the IMF in Washington. But the lending agency 
has made it clear, the next loan installment would only be released 
after Russia comes up with a firm commitment to continue on the path 
of reform. Mr. Mosliokof, a former top Soviet economic official, had 
earlier indicated a preference for tighter state controls. Some reports 
had said the government was considering a plan to limit the circulation 
of dollars, something that worried Russian and foreign business leaders. 
But Mr. Mosliokof called that idea rubbish. MOSLIOKOF He said, "On 
the contrary. The more dollars people bring into Russia, the better." 
He told the audience, "Please feel free to use dollars as you see 
fit." He reiterated the statements of other government officials that 
despite their Soviet past, they have no plan to return to a Soviet 
styled planned economy. Peter Heinlein, VOA News, Moscow.
