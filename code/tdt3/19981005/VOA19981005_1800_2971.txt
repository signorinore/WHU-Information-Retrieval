Right now it's time for business news. We go to New York for a report 
on the financial markets. Here's VOA's Breck Ardery. The Dow Jones 
Industrial average closed at 7726, down 58 points. The Standard & 
Poor's 500 Index closed at 988, down 14 points. Now during the day's 
trading, the industrial average twice dropped by more than 200 points, 
but made a strong recovery in the last hour of trading, a recovery 
which analysts say was largely fueled by futures related buying and 
other technical factors.
