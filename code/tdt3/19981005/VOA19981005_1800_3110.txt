And Boston Chicken, that once hugely successful restaurant chain has 
fallen on very hard times. The company filed for bankruptcy law protection 
and will close 16 percent of its 1,100 restaurants. The company stock 
which traded at a high of $41 a share two years ago is now worth about 
$.30. Analysts say there's nothing wrong with the food, but that Boston 
Chicken simply used too much debt to finance is growth. Breck Ardery, 
VOA News, New York. Thank you, Breck.
