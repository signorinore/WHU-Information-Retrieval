Part of an interstate highway might be named for Mark McGuire, the 
baseball player who set a new home run record this season. McGuire 
hit 70 home runs for the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team. Coincidentally, 
interstate highway 70 goes through St. Louis County, Missouri. That's 
the home of the Cardinals. The U.S. Senate has approved a bill that 
would give the name Mark McGuire interstate route 70 to the portion 
of the highway that goes through St. Louis County. The bill was proposed 
by Senator Christopher Bond who, of course, is from the state of Missouri. 
Sounds like a little politics there.
