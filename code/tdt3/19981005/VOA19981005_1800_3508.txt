Well, most of us have been tourists at one time or another. We collect 
souvenirs, do we not? Some souvenirs of the state of Virginia are 
related to the American Civil War which occurred in the 1860s and 
one these souvenirs could get you into a bit of trouble. Tiny bronze 
replicas of civil war cannons had been popular items at gift shops 
in the Richmond, Virginia airport. But now they've been banished from 
the airport because of officials from the Aviation Administration 
and the airlines worried that the little cannon could be mistaken 
for real ones. I don't understand the story, Tony. I don't either. 
How could you -- I've never seen a tiny cannon that works. Well, and 
even if it did, I mean, what kind of -- are you going to blow away 
a wing or something? Just curious.
