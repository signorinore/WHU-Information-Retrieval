On the subject of how the U.S. is affected, in Tokyo today the Japanese 
government said Japan's economy will shrink nearly 2% this year. That's 
the second year in a row that the Japanese economy has contracted. 
One more reason for people in Asia and America to be nervous. ABC's 
Mark Litke reports from Tokyo. Even on a Gray and gloomy day, if can 
be difficult to see Japan's recession. On the surface, the world's 
second largest economy still appears as prosperous as ever. But clearly 
it is not. After eight years of predicting recovery was just around 
the corner, Japanese officials are now publicly admitting the worst 
is yet to come. Higher unemployment, more bankruptcies and, most serious, 
the possibility of more bank failures. Burdened with $1 trillion in 
bad debts, Japanese banks already have virtually stopped lending, 
bringing economic growth to a standstill. The agenda for Japan is 
very clear and simple. There's no mystery. Number one, its banks are 
virtually bankrupt so it has to recapitalize its banks. Number two, 
the economy is contracting. You've got to get growth, so fiscal measures, 
tax cuts. And number three, you've got to cut the structures off this 
economy. You've got to deregulate, give people good reason to invest, 
create optimism, a reason to spend money. Up to now, Japan's response 
to the economic crisis has been to move slowly, to build consensus, 
the way decisions are traditionally made here. But there were signs 
today the country may finally realize there's no more time to waste. 
In parliament, they inched closer toward passage of the critical banking 
reform bills. The prime minister also vowed to speed up his economic 
stimulus package, over $100 billion in public spending and tax cuts. 
From the parliament, to the people, it seems Japan is at least starting 
to accept that, without decisive action, the gloom could Hang over 
this country for years to come. Mark Litke, ABC News, Tokyo.
