Overseas tonight, the U.S. and its allies in NATO are revving up forces 
should they be needed in Kosovo. The U.S. believes the Serbs have 
still not withdrawn their troops from the province of Kosovo and hundreds 
of thousands of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are still on the run. NATO 
threatened air strikes. Still no one is ready yet to say when. Here's 
ABC's John McWethy. In the Mediterranean today, the U.S. was showing 
off part of the force that would be used if the Serbs failed to back 
down. One ship would fire cruise missiles in a first wave and, if 
necessary, planes off the carrier would follow. President Clinton 
said today NAto is nearly ready to strike. The stakes are high. The 
time is now to end the violence in Kosovo. What the U.N. and NATO 
are demanding is that Serb leader, Slobodan Milosevic, pull back his 
forces, allow humanitarian aid for refugees and begin peace talks 
with the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo who make up 90% of the population 
there. In the capital of Kosovo today, special envoy Richard Holbrooke 
told ABC's Mike Lee that all Serb troops have not withdrawn. The Serb 
military forces, the regular forces and the uniformed police, are 
still in the area and in very substantial numbers as this map shows. 
It's a very bad situation. On Capitol Hill, defense secretary Cohen 
faced first public questions about the possibility U.S. troops might 
eventually be needed after air strikes. If there is going to be an 
operation in Kosovo, will it require afterwards a peace-keeping mission 
there? It could require an international presence. Would that include 
U.S. troops? It's a possibility, but one that I have urged that we 
not get involved on the ground in Kosovo. NATO has been threatening 
air strikes for weeks. Allies do not want to move that fast, saying 
diplomacy, given more time, could do the job. John McWethy, ABC News, 
Pentagon.
