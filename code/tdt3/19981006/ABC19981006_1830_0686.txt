One of the world's leading human rights organizations has issued a 
report today on human rights violations in the United States. Amnesty 
international is one of the groups we have always looked to to monitor 
human rights abuses elsewhere. American officials often quote amnesty 
when they hold other nations accountable for acts of brutality or 
violence. In this case it is very close to home. Here's ABC's Bill 
Blakemore. The report finds human rights abuses in all 50 states, 
mostly in the form of police brutality and mistreatment of prisons. 
There are very serious human rights violations in this country which 
most Americans don't recognize. And which the government often denies. 
According to amnesty, America's fast-growing prisons often use degrading 
methods of control such as those in this training video for guards, 
made in a Texas prison. The report criticizes the use of chain gangs 
for men and women, restraint chairs for prisoners and remote-controlled 
stun belts for violent prisoners which make them collapse. Some law 
enforcement officials defend all these practices and are angry to 
be cited by a group that often concentrates on countries such as Iraq. 
I don't need an amnesty international to come down here and tell this 
sheriff and the people that live in this county what to do. While 
I'm a strong supporter, I think they have misjudged this issue. To 
single out the U.S. as a perpetrator of human rights violations. I 
think it's preposterous and unacceptable. The report does not rank 
America with other countries. It does praise America's leading role 
in creating laws to prevent human rights abuses but says it's important 
to judge how well the U.S. lives up to those laws. Governments like 
China that might want to resist that scrutiny will have a harder time 
doing that because the U.S. had to be scrutinized under the same standards. 
Amnesty says if the U.S. is seen around the world to be confronting 
practices like these at home, it will only increase America's credibility 
as a champion of human rights. Bill Blakemore, ABC News, New York.
