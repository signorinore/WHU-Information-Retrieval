We are doing a series on privacy this week -- privacy lost. Last night 
we looked at how vulnerable we are to our employers if they choose 
to look through E-mail and voice mail, which they very often do. Tonight, 
we make it all too clear how much there is to be learned about us 
without too much effort. What you make, what you eat, what you owe, 
what you buy. There is an electronic biography of you out there. Here's 
ABC's Gina Smith. Melissa sands used to think of her private life 
as just that. Private. Then we showed her what we found on the Internet. 
This is your tax information. oh, my god. And this is your husband, 
your ex-husband's name? Oh, yes. Do you recognize any of these names 
and numbers? These are all the people who live around me, their names, 
their addresses. There are dozens of so-called "information brokers" 
operating online. Using just sands' name and her address from the 
phone book, they were able to get her property records, financial 
information, driving records, even her social security number. wow! 
All for $116. You could find civil suits, bankruptcies, liens, judgments. 
Those are all quick and easy searches that are really affordable today. 
a lot of the information was always public, but it never was so easy 
to get. You had to know what courthouse was holding the records and 
you had to be willing to sift through a lot of files or pay a private 
detective to do it for you. Now, all that information is just a few 
keystrokes away. We are on the verge of a very serious privacy problem 
in this country. David sobel is a privacy activist. He says the next 
big threat is corporate America. It's starting to collect all kinds 
of information on what customers buy and how much they spend, even 
at the corner grocery. Health or life insurance companies might be 
interested in accessing these grocery store data bases to assess the 
dietary habits. And God help you if you buy a pack of cigarettes at 
the grocery store. And that gets scanned in and tied to your name. 
What you buy on the Internet also leaves a data trail. The web site 
for Victoria's secret may no longer be your secret. A prospective 
employer might find your buying habits very interesting. Combine that 
type of information with the public information already available 
about you, and soon there will be detailed profiles available on everyone, 
ensuring that virtually nothing you do will ever be private again.
