Over the years, the IMF fund has collected 193 billion. The smallest 
contribution comes from the pacific island of Palau, 3.8 million. 
The largest from the U.S., about $36 billion. The Clinton administration 
wants to put an extra $18 billion, which the IMF says it needs. Some 
republicans in Congress are opposed, unless IMF requires borrowers 
to abide by U.S. trade agreements. Quite a lot to swallow. Coincidentally, 
the U.S. collects interest on the money it puts into the IMF and a 
treasury official says the U.S. has never lost a penny on any loan. 
Despite all the gloom and doom about countries in trouble, the IMF 
says no borrower has ever completely defaulted on a loan.
