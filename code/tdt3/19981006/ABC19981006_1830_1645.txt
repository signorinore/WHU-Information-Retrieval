Finally this evening, a last word about the word. We stumbled over 
this very novel advertising campaign in south Florida. Whoever paid 
the several hundred thousand dollars for this wishes to remain anonymous, 
but the sponsor seems pretty clear. On a throughway -- "keep using 
my name in vain, I'll make rush hour longer." Signed, "God." This 
is Florida, remember. "You think it's hot here. They are very quick 
and contemporary. "Let's meet at my house." The messages are all signed 
God. What part of thou shalt not didn't you understand? Signed God.
