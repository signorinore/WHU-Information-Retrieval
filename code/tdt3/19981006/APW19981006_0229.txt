Ukraine's inflation reached 3.8 percent in September, the highest 
monthly rate so far in 1998, the State Statistics Committee said Tuesday. 
Total inflation from the start of the year was 6.2 percent, it said. 
Officials had previously voiced fears that September inflation could 
reach 7.5 percent or more. Although the actual figure was much lower, 
it still represented a negative sign for Ukraine's shaky financial 
system. Following nearly two years of relative price stability, the 
former Soviet republic has been badly hit by Russia's financial turmoil, 
which has only aggravated the Ukrainian government's failure to implement 
reforms needed to increase budget revenues and boost economic growth. 
Ukraine's hryvna currency has been sliding steadily in response to 
the Russian ruble's fall, causing a massive increase in prices. Inflation 
in Ukraine has declined steadily since reaching more than 10,000 percent 
in 1993, and the annual rate dropped to 10 percent in 1997 and 2.3 
percent in the first eight months of 1998. Inflation in August amounted 
to 0.2 percent.
