Chinese President Jiang Zemin will make a landmark visit to Australia 
in 1999, in a further sign of thawing relations between the two countries, 
Australian Associated Press reported Tuesday. In accepting a longstanding 
invitation, Jiang will be the most senior member of China's Communist 
leadership to ever journey to Australia. Confirmation of next year's 
visit came Tuesday as China congratulated Prime Minister John Howard 
on his victory in Saturday's election, the Australian domestic news 
agency reported from Beijing. It followed speculation that a visit 
could be organized as early as next month to follow the Asia Pacific 
Economic Cooperation leaders' forum in Kuala Lumpur. ``He (Jiang) 
is not going this year. He has accepted an invitation to visit next 
year. We don't have any dates yet. They are still to be confirmed,'' 
AAP quoted an Australian Embassy spokesman as saying. A November visit 
had been discussed but Chinese officials felt that the president would 
be busy with major domestic commitments in the aftermath of this year's 
floods, the spokesman said. Zhu Bangzao, a Chinese Foreign Ministry 
spokesman, declined when asked by a reporter to confirm next year's 
visit. But he said China believes that meetings between Australian 
and Chinese leaders ``play an important and irreplacable role for 
the development of bilateral relations.'' Howard extended an open 
invitation to Jiang to visit Australia during an official visit to 
China in early 1997. The prime ministerial tour helped ease bilateral 
tensions after China was angered by early diplomatic stumbles by the 
Howard government shortly after its election in 1996. Premier Zhu 
Rongji _ now the second highest ranked Chinese leader _ visited Australia 
in May 1997, but at the time was ranked fifth in the powerful seven-member 
Communist Party Politburo standing committee. Zhu's visit was marked 
by small demonstrations railing against China's human rights record. 
During Jiang's visit to the United States last year, thousands of 
demonstrators dogged his trail to protest against human rights abuses 
and urge greater political freedom in China. Australia has received 
a series of official visits since early 1997 as relations rebounded 
from the downturn in 1996 on the back of the Howard government's softer 
approach to the human rights issue.
