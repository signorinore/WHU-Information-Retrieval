Finland's leading fertilizer and chemicals company, Kemira, reported 
Tuesday an eight-month pretax profit of 660 million markkaa (dlrs 
132 million), up from 642 million markkaa in 1997. Net sales from 
January through August increased to 10 billion markkaa (dlrs 2 billion), 
from 9.7 billion markkaa for the same period last year. Sales in the 
core businesses of chemicals, pigments, fertilizers and colorants 
production were up by 6 percent, Kemira Group said. The company said 
that it had been little affected by the financial crisis in Russia 
which accounts for about 2 percent of its total sales. ``Net income 
for the group is expected to be close to last year's record level,'' 
the company said in a statement. In 1997, Kemira had a pretax profit 
of 864 million markka (dlrs 173 million), with net sales of 14.4 billion 
markkaa (dlrs 2.9 billion). In January, Kemira announced it had extended 
a major deal with Rhone Poulenc Agro of France to manufacture corn 
herbicides worth 1 billion markkaa (dlrs 200 million). Kemira also 
makes pharmaceuticals. It is 54-percent state-owned, and employs 10,500 
people in 25 countries.
