Egypt on Tuesday marked the 25th anniversary of its last war against 
Israel with a military parade reviewed by President Hosni Mubarak, 
who called the war a victory for peace. The parade, conducted at an 
army camp near the Suez Canal town of Ismailia, was the first on the 
anniversary since the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Saddat 
by Muslim radicals during a similar show of strength. In Tuesday's 
ceremony, shown on national television, Mubarak was driven past a 
forest of rocket launchers, thousands of tanks, armored vehicles and 
artillery pieces, and naval assault boats looking incongruous on the 
desert sands. The show included heavy US-made M1A1 tanks, better known 
as Abrams, lighter Egyptian made Walid and Fahd armored vehicles and 
anti-aircraft missile systems. Before attending the parade Mubarak 
told Egyptian television that Middle East 1973 War war was ``a lightning 
point in Egypt's modern military history.'' ``It was a war that opened 
the road for peace,'' he said on the program Good Morning Egypt. Egypt 
became the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 
1979. But Mubarak warned against what he called Israel's growing arsenal, 
saying it constitutes ``a threat to the security of the region.'' 
Mubarak has used the war anniversary to criticize Israel in a series 
of interviews, blaming the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
for the stalemate in peace talks with the Palestinians. ``From the 
day Netanyahu was elected and until today, nothing has been implemented. 
The peace process has stopped,'' Mubarak told Israel's Channel 2 Monday 
night. Mubarak watched Tuesday's parade through aviator-style sunglasses, 
flanked by his defense minister and senior army officers. The president, 
a former pilot, was air force commander in the 1973 war. Some 2,500 
Israelis, 15,000 Egyptians, 7,700 Syrians and 125 Iraqis were killed 
in the war of 0ct. 6-24, 1973. Tens of thousands were wounded. Egypt 
considers the war a military victory because its soldiers overran 
Israeli forces in crossing the Suez Canal, challenging the myth of 
Israel's invincibility. Egyptians believe the rebuilding of Arab pride 
from the war led to peace with Israel six years later.
