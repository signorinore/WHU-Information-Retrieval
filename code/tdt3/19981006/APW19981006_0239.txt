A shakeup of his Cabinet will not mean any change in policies to tackle 
Thailand's economic crisis, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said Tuesday. 
Chuan spoke at a news conference after the first Cabinet meeting since 
a reshuffle in which he brought a former opposition party into the 
government coalition to boost its parliamentary majority. ``Policies 
will remain the same as we had announced,'' Chuan said. ``The implementation 
methods of each Cabinet member may be different, however.'' Chuan's 
new Cabinet includes members of the Chart Pattana Party, formerly 
the second largest opposition party, which agreed to join the coalition 
last week. With Chart Pattana's 51 lawmakers, the seven-party coalition 
controls a majority of 255 seats in the 393-seat House of Representatives. 
Chuan said he would not protect any Cabinet member tainted by allegations 
of corruption. The reshuffle was triggered in part by the resignation 
of one Cabinet minister and two deputies, who left to take responsibility 
for scandals over the purchase of overpriced items under programs 
handled by their ministries. Chuan also said his government would 
not keep the current Parliament in office for its full four-year term 
to November 2000, but declined to give a date for any future elections. 
The Cabinet reshuffle should make it easier for the coalition to push 
its economic reform package through Parliament, where it has met stiff 
resistance from the opposition. Major reform measures coming before 
the Parliament this month include amendments to enable timely foreclosure 
on debt collateral, to allow greater foreign participation and ownership 
of businesses and small portions of land, and to allow state enterprises 
to be turned into corporations ahead of partial privatizations. Opposition 
leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh said he will give Chuan's new Cabinet 
a two-month grace period before lodging a censure motion against the 
government, local newspapers reported Tuesday. ``I expect it to be 
very soon. In a couple of months,'' Chavalit was quoted as saying 
in the Bangkok Post. With only 132 lawmakers in the opposition, Chavalit 
does not have the votes necessary to topple Chuan's coalition in a 
censure debate, also known as a no-confidence debate. Chuan's government 
also enjoys a greater measure of popularity than other recent governments, 
despite corruption allegations that surfaced at the education, public 
health and agriculture ministries.
