With the admonition that ``time is running out,'' Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright is holding back-to-back meetings with Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. 
Her aim is to narrow differences on a West Bank accord before President 
Bill Clinton hosts a summit with the two Mideast leaders later in 
the month. She went to Netanyahu's office early Tuesday for a meeting 
that was expected to last about two hours and was traveling to the 
West Bank town of Jericho later in the day to meet with Arafat. ``There 
is a sense of urgency,'' Albright said on her way to Jerusalem Monday 
from Washington for two days of talks. ``The United States can do 
a great deal, but the leaders have to be willing to make decisions,'' 
Albright said. But Netanyahu said there would be no agreement for 
an Israeli pullback unless the Palestinian Authority carried out its 
commitment to clamp down on Islamic militants opposed to the peace 
process. And Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, speaking to Associated 
Press Television News in the West Bank town of Jericho, accused the 
Clinton administration of allowing Israel to drag its feet on living 
up to past accords. If Albright is unable to bridge the differences, 
Clinton could come up short in his bid to play peacemaker in the Middle 
East as he successfully did in Northern Ireland. ``I don't expect 
her to come back with all the issues resolved,'' State Department 
spokesman James P. Rubin said Monday. Albright's aim is to ``whittle 
away, clear some underbrush'' to set the stage for intensive negotiations 
in Washington, he said. Clinton brought Netanyahu and Arafat to the 
White House last week to try to set up a timetable for forging an 
agreement. After months of U.S. prodding, Netanyahu has agreed to 
relinquish 13 percent of the West Bank, with 3 percent turned into 
a nature preserve under joint Israeli-Palestinian security. Arafat 
said he had accepted the arrangement. But Netanyahu made it clear 
an accord was conditional on Palestinian territory not being used 
to launch attacks against Israeli civilians. The Palestinian Authority 
has said it is working to contain militant groups like Hamas, but 
that even its best efforts cannot provide an ironclad guarantee against 
attacks.
