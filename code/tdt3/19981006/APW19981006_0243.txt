Another five Customs officers in Ho Chi Minh City have been accused 
of complicity in Vietnam's biggest smuggling ring, bringing the number 
of suspects in the case to more than 80, the newspaper Tuoi Tre reported 
Tuesday. The Tan Truong Sanh smuggling ring was uncovered last year 
when police raided a warehouse hired from the army and found electronic 
goods worth millions of dollars on which no import duty had been paid. 
The ring reportedly hired police cars to escort smuggled containers 
of goods.
