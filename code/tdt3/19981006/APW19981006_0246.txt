On the eve of a nationwide labor protest, the government warned hard-line 
opposition leaders Tuesday that they could face criminal charges for 
inciting armed revolt. Russian labor unions predict that up to 28 
million people will take part in strikes, rallies and demonstrations 
throughout Russia on Wednesday. Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov 
said that up to 40 million will show, although most observers expect 
a much smaller turnout. A similar protest last year drew an estimated 
2 million people in hundreds of demonstrations across Russia. Seeking 
to cool the most die-hard opposition factions, Justice Minister Pavel 
Krasheninnikov warned that criminal proceedings could be launched 
against retired Gen. Albert Makashov, a Communist member of parliament, 
and several other opposition leaders who addressed rallies over the 
weekend. Their calls for the government's ouster by force are punishable 
by law, Krasheninnikov told a news conference Tuesday. However, Makashov 
enjoys immunity from prosecution as a lawmaker, and the Communists, 
who dominate the parliament's lower house, could easily block any 
attempt to lift his immunity. Krasheninnikov said he had told opposition 
leaders that Justice Ministry officials would attend all the rallies 
to see whether they comply with the law. ``I would like to specifically 
warn those trying to incite tensions that the authorities will closely 
follow the events. If we hear calls for violent overthrow of the constitutional 
order, we will make our conclusions,'' he said. Trade unions and the 
Communist-led opposition have pledged that the protests they are organizing 
jointly will proceed peacefully. However, officials are preparing 
for unrest that could be sparked by growing popular anger over the 
government's inability to pay wages and pensions that are months overdue. 
Police and interior troops have been put on alert throughout Russia. 
More than 11,000 policemen and 4,000 Interior Ministry troops will 
be deployed in Moscow alone, according to an Interior Ministry official 
cited by the ITAR-Tass news agency. While unions are largely pursuing 
economic goals, the Communists are using the protest to further weaken 
President Boris Yeltsin's power. Other Yeltsin opponents are also 
seizing the opportunity to advance their own goals. Gen. Alexander 
Lebed, governor of the vast Krasnoyarsk province in Central Siberia 
and a presidential hopeful, told reporters Tuesday that Yeltsin's 
resignation is ``inevitable,'' the Interfax news agency reported. 
``Any government must serve the people, and if it fails to deliver 
it must go,'' Lebed was quoted as saying. Strikes have been frequent 
in many industries. Earlier this year, coal miners blockaded several 
key railroads, including the Trans-Siberian, for several weeks. However, 
most protests have been uncoordinated and have not caused major disruptions 
to the economy.
