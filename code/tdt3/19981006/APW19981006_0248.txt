The Royal Australian Air Force will take part in a bilateral training 
exercise in Malaysia's mountainous terrain beginning this week. A 
total of 10 RAAF FA-18 Hornets and five F-111s will fly to the region 
for Exercise Churinga with the Malaysian air force at Kuantan. The 
exercise in low-level strike training in mountainous terrain and a 
tropical environment would run Oct. 8-29, the air force said in a 
statement. The commanding officer of No. 77 Squadron, Wing Cmdr. Mark 
Binskin, said the exercise would also provide combat training against 
Malaysia's MiG-29 fighters. ``Churinga gives us an opportunity to 
discuss tactics and procedures with an important regional partner,'' 
he said. ``Ground crew will also benefit from the deployment as they 
will be exposed to operations on a different base. Logistics support 
requirements will also be exercised.''
