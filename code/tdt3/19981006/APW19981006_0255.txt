A senior American envoy engaged in shuttle diplomacy Tuesday against 
the specter of impending NATO airstrikes, but U.S. officials were 
pessimistic about averting intervention in the face of continuing 
defiance by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. U.S. envoy Richard 
Holbrooke, after meeting in Kosovo's capital with diplomatic observers, 
said Serbian military police still maintain a strong presence in Kosovo 
despite repeated international demands for them to ease their crackdown 
on separatists. ``U.S. diplomatic observers are doing a terrific job 
bringing us information, and the information is not good,'' he told 
reporters before heading for talks with ethnic Albanian leaders. He 
was expected to return to Belgrade for another meeting with Milosevic 
Tuesday night. Despite the shuttle talks, the likelihood of Milosevic 
concessions or a diplomatic agreement that would satisfy Western leaders 
set on military intervention appeared limited. Milosevic told Holbrooke 
late Monday that his government is willing to seek a ``political solution'' 
to the seven-month crisis in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels 
are battling for independence. Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of 
the 2 million-strong Kosovo population, and most favor self-rule. 
But Milosevic called the threats of aggression against Yugoslavia 
``a criminal act'' that provide ``support for the Albanian villains, 
not the Albanian people,'' according to a statement issued through 
state media. His defiant comments came after a meeting that lasted 
several hours in which Holbrooke told the Yugoslav president of the 
``the grave situation we are facing.'' ``If he thinks NATO is bluffing, 
if he is willing to take that risk, all I can do is convey the views 
of the U.S. government,'' Holbrooke told reporters Tuesday in Pristina. 
Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 agreement that ended the Bosnian 
war, was dispatched to the federal Yugoslav capital of Belgrade in 
what appeared to be a last-chance effort to persuade Milosevic to 
halt his crackdown and enter talks with ethnic Albanians on the future 
of the province. But there was no sign of the diplomatic deadlock 
ending. On Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the 
Interfax news agency that Russia, a staunch ally of Serbia, would 
use its veto to stop any move to approve airstrikes on Yugoslavia 
by the U.N. Security Council, which was set to take up Kosovo later 
Tuesday. The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic 
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three years 
a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. But the ethnic 
Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic, and U.S. Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright voiced skepticism Milosevic would adhere 
to any such plan in any case. ``We are dealing with someone we never 
trusted,'' Albright told reporters en route from Washington to Jerusalem. 
Hundreds have been killed and tens of thousands have been forced from 
their homes since Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 against 
the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army. NATO officials say they are 
ready to launch airstrikes within hours. No final decision is expected 
until Thursday, when ambassadors of the allied countries gather for 
a NATO Council meeting in Brussels. Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
continued to press for a political solution to the crisis on Tuesday. 
``I have spent almost two days preparing and holding telephone talks 
on Kosovo,'' he told Russian news agencies. French President Jacques 
Chirac, one of the leaders Yeltsin spoke with, agreed with Yeltsin 
that force would not work and would entail ``serious international 
consequences,'' the Kremlin press office said. In Washington, U.S. 
President Bill Clinton expressed concern Monday that Milosevic was 
``playing the classic game of making false promises'' to avoid NATO 
military strikes. Clinton, in a telephone call with Yeltsin, said 
Milosevic's compliance with U.N. demands ``must be verifiable, tangible 
and irreversible,'' press secretary Joe Lockhart said at the White 
House. At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Monday 
that Yugoslav forces increased their attacks on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians 
even after a U.N. resolution Sept. 23 demanded a cease-fire. U.S. 
State Department spokesman James Foley said the Clinton administration 
believed Milosevic had not met the conditions laid down by the Security 
Council. Briefing reporters in Washington, Foley cited the absence 
of a formal cease-fire, the failure to arrange a meaningful dialogue 
with ethnic Albanian leaders and the continued presence of ``major 
army units'' in southeastern Kosovo near Albania's border.
