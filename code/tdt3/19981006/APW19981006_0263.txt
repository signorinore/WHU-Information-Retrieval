Philippine and U.S. officials have concluded a new military agreement 
to cover visits by Filipino soldiers to the United States, a senior 
official said Tuesday. The accord complements an earlier pact, the 
Visiting Forces Agreement, that would allow the resumption of large-scale 
joint military exercises in the Philippines, Foreign Secretary Domingo 
Siazon said. Siazon, who referred to the second agreement as VFA-2, 
said it governs the entry of Filipino defense personnel and their 
dependents into the United States and includes guidelines on jurisdiction 
over Filipino soldiers who commit crimes while in U.S. territory. 
He said the agreement will be submitted to a Cabinet committee in 
charge of security this week. If it is approved by President Joseph 
Estrada, ``we'll be able to sign the VFA-2 by next week,'' he said. 
He added that only Israel, Spain and Singapore have similar agreements 
with the United States. He did not give other details of the new accord. 
Siazon also said that on Monday, Estrada signed the ratification instrument 
of the first Visiting Forces Agreement in preparation for its submission 
to the Philippine Senate later this week for approval. The United 
States halted all major exercises in the Philippines and visits by 
U.S. military ships in December 1996, when the Manila government ended 
a legal loophole that had shielded U.S. military personnel from prosecution 
by the Philippines for crimes committed here. The VFA, signed in February 
this year by U.S. and Philippine officials, would provide legal protections 
to U.S. soldiers while on duty in the Philippines. Critics say the 
accord limits the Philippine government's right to prosecute American 
soldiers who commit crimes in the country. It generally gives the 
United States jurisdiction over soldiers who commit crimes while on 
duty, and the Philippines jurisdiction over crimes committed while 
off duty. They say it also would promote prostitution.
