Amid calls for revitalizing the party by promoting younger members 
and more women, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's defeated Christian Democrats 
closed ranks Tuesday behind a new leader _ Kohl's own right-hand man. 
The party's presiding council voted unanimously Monday night to recommend 
as chairman Wolfgang Schaueble, Kohl's parliamentary faction leader 
and the man he handpicked as his replacement. The party board was 
expected to confirm the choice Tuesday, with the final vote to be 
made at a party convention on Nov. 7. The choice of Schaeuble was 
made despite criticism from some party members that a bolder break 
was needed from Kohl, who led the Christian Democrats in last week's 
election to its worst showing in 50 years. The Christian Democratic 
Union has dominated German postwar politics by attracting a wide range 
of conservative voters. But young members in particular worry that 
the party has lost touch with the national mood during Kohl's 25-year 
chairmanship and his 16 years as chancellor. ``It's incomprehensible 
that Kohl again says what's coming,'' Christian Wulff, party chief 
in Lower Saxony state, was quoted as saying Monday. ``The party must 
immediately and without looking back separate itself from Kohl,'' 
said another of the so-called ``Wild Youth,'' Kaja Schommer from Saxony 
state. Rita Suessmuth, a Christian Democrat who will be losing her 
post as parliamentary president, criticized the paucity of female 
names being mentioned in discussions about renewing the party. ``Women 
in the CDU are ready to help renew, but are not being included,'' 
she told Stern magazine in an interview published Tuesday. Among the 
five candidates for four deputy chair positions to be chosen at the 
convention, only one is a woman _ Kohl's outgoing Environment Minister 
Angela Merkel. And Suessmuth noted only 18 percent of CDU lawmakers 
in parliament are women _ the lowest percentage of any party. She 
called for replacing the outgoing party secretary, Peter Hintze, with 
a woman. ``That's overdue and needs no additional reason,'' she said.
