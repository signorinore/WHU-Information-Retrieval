BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Parliament voted Tuesday to 
lift the immunity of France's National Front leader Jean-Marie Le 
Pen so a German court can try him for calling the Holocaust ``a detail'' 
of history. The European Union assembly, meeting in Strasbourg, France, 
voted 420 to 20 to lift Le Pen's immunity, with six abstentions. The 
request for a waiver of Le Pen 's parliamentary immunity came from 
prosecutors in Munich last April, after the far-right leader told 
a press conference ``the gas chambers were a detail in the history 
of the Second World War.''
