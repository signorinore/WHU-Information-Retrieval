With the United States and Britain threatening air strikes against 
Yugoslavia, China said Tuesday it opposed the use of force or sanctions 
to end Belgrade's crackdown in rebellious Kosovo province. Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang urged the international community 
to settle the dispute ``through political dialogue.'' ``China is not 
in favor of military action or the threat of force. Military action 
or sanctions are not conducive to the settlement of the question,'' 
Tang told reporters. ``The Chinese side believes the sovereignty and 
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia should be respected,'' he added. 
Another Foreign Ministry spokesman, Zhu Bangzao, said the situation 
in Kosovo _ where Yugoslavia has been trying to quash an ethnic Albanian 
separatist movement _ has been improving. Their comments underscore 
divisions among the veto-wielding members of the U.N. Security Council. 
Russia declared Tuesday it would use its veto to stop authorization 
of air strikes against the Serbs, traditional allies. Tang said Chinese 
Premier Zhu Rongji conveyed Beijing's opposition to the use of force 
during talks with visiting British Prime Minister Tony Blair. In London, 
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Monday a decision by NATO on the 
air strikes was imminent.
