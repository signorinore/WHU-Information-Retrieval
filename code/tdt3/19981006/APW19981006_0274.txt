Munich's judicial authorities say they want to charge Le Pen under 
an article of the German criminal code which makes it an offense to 
belittle the Holocaust. If tried and convicted, Le Pen could face 
up to five years in prison. In a speech to the parliament before the 
vote, Le Pen said a decision against would be an attack on his right 
to free speech. ``You should vote massively to refuse this lifting 
of immunity,'' Le Pen said. ``Parliament's are not legitimate if their 
members are not free.'' Le Pen denied his comments had denied or minimized 
the Holocaust and said his comments had been distorted by the Munich 
prosecutors. Under German law, members of the European Parliament 
cannot be prosecuted, unless the 626-seat European Union assembly 
votes to lift immunity. French legislation gives European Parliament 
members less protection, and Le Pen was convicted in his homeland 
for assaulting a Socialist politician last year. The French court 
stripped Le Pen of his civil rights for two years, in effect banning 
him from holding office, running for office, or voting. He also was 
fined 20,000 French francs (dlrs 3,660). Le Pen has appealed the French 
verdict. If upheld, the conviction could make Le Pen ineligible to 
run in the June 1999 European Parliament elections. He has said that 
in that case his wife, Jany, would run in his place.
