Dissidents, human rights campaigners and foreign governments on Tuesday 
welcomed China's signing of a treaty intended to safeguard human rights 
and urged Beijing to quickly implement the accord. ``Since China is 
currently in violation of almost every article of the covenant, we 
hope its decision to sign indicates a change in human rights practices,'' 
said Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asian division of Human 
Rights Watch, a New York-based group. ``The test will be in the implementation.'' 
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, signed Monday 
by China at the United Nations, backs the right of self-determination, 
prohibits torture and provides for freedom of movement, religion, 
expression and association. By signing, Beijing demonstrated a commitment 
to refrain from actions that violate rights enshrined in the accord, 
the New York-based group Human Rights in China said in a statement. 
``We hope that this will be followed quickly by concrete steps to 
ratify and implement the covenant,'' the group said. It urged the 
Chinese government to demonstrate its intention to comply with the 
pact by releasing political prisoners and opening a ``public dialogue'' 
with all Chinese citizens on the issue of human rights. Australian 
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer called China's signature ``a significant 
reflection of its increasing commitment to the promotion and protection 
of civil and political rights.'' He called for rapid implementation 
of the covenant and a sister pact. The two accords are seen as fundamental 
to protecting human rights. China signed the other one _ the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights _ a year ago but 
hasn't ratified it. Neither treaty will take effect until ratified 
by the legislature, which may attach reservations effectively nullifying 
some provisions. Asked Tuesday when legislative approval might be 
forthcoming, a Chinese government spokesman, Zhu Bangzao, said ratification 
``takes time.'' China's U.N. ambassador, Qin Huasun, said the government 
was deliberating on ratifying the accords. ``All these have demonstrated 
the firm resolve of China to promote and protect human rights,'' Qin 
said. Hours before the treaty was signed, Beijing police hauled a 
prominent human rights campaigner in for questioning Monday. Qin Yongmin 
had tried for the second time in a week to legally register a human 
rights monitoring group. ``The Chinese authorities continue to impose 
systematic restrictions on the exercise of the rights and freedoms 
contained in the covenant, despite rhetoric about their commitment 
to human rights,'' the statement from Human Rights in China said. 
Dissidents accused China of promising to sign the human rights covenant 
to maximize its diplomatic advantage and silence critics of its civil 
rights record. ``Signing could still be the right move for the wrong 
reasons but only if we see tangible human rights improvements.'' said 
Jones of Human Rights Watch.
