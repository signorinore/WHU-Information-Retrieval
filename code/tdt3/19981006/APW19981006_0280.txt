Rolan Bykov, a Russian actor who made his mark in films ranging from 
tragic epics to adventures for children, died at age 68 Tuesday after 
what doctors described as a difficult illness, Russian news agencies 
reported. He made his film debut in 1955, and played roles in 80 films, 
including Andrei Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublyov. He directed several movies, 
including the film ``Scarecrow,'' which focused on children's cruelty 
to one another. Still, he was a strong advocate for children, and 
worked in his last years to keep the Russian children's film industry 
alive.
