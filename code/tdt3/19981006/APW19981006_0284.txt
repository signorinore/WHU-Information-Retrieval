BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Parliament voted Tuesday to 
lift the immunity of France's National Front leader Jean-Marie Le 
Pen so a German court can try him for calling the Holocaust ``a detail'' 
of history. The European Union assembly, meeting in Strasbourg, France, 
voted 420 to 20 to lift Le Pen's immunity, with six abstentions. The 
request for a waiver of Le Pen 's parliamentary immunity came from 
prosecutors in Munich last April, after the far-right leader told 
a news conference ``the gas chambers were a detail in the history 
of the Second World War.'' Munich's judicial authorities say they 
want to charge Le Pen under an article of the German criminal code 
which makes it an offense to belittle the Holocaust. If tried and 
convicted, Le Pen could face up to five years in prison. In a speech 
to the parliament before the vote, Le Pen said a decision against 
would be an attack on his right to free speech. ``You should vote 
massively to refuse this lifting of immunity,'' Le Pen said. ``Parliament's 
are not legitimate if their members are not free.'' Le Pen said his 
comments had not denied or minimized the Holocaust and had been distorted 
by the Munich prosecutors. ``If these comments have been interpreted 
in a way that made sincere people suffer, I'm sorry,'' he said. Under 
German law, members of the European Parliament cannot be prosecuted, 
unless the 626-seat European Union assembly votes to lift immunity. 
French legislation gives European Parliament members less protection, 
and Le Pen was convicted in his homeland for assaulting a Socialist 
politician last year. The French court stripped Le Pen of his civil 
rights for two years, in effect banning him from holding office, running 
for office, or voting. He also was fined 20,000 French francs (dlrs 
3,660). Le Pen has appealed the French verdict. If upheld, the conviction 
could make Le Pen ineligible to run in the June 1999 European Parliament 
elections. He has said that in that case his wife, Jany, would run 
in his place.
