France Telecom has tapped IBM to develop software that would allow 
the 6 million users of the Minitel system to access the Internet, 
according to a report Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal. The Minitel, 
a screen and keyboard console linked to the telephone, has since the 
early 1980s given users access to a variety of information services 
in France, but its Internet access has been limited to E-mail messages. 
France Telecom could announce the project Tuesday, according to the 
newspaper. A spokesman for the Paris-based telecom operator declined 
to comment on the report.
