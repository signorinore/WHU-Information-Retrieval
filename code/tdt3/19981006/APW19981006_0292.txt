An anti-personnel mine was found on a boat that later took Ukrainian 
lawmakers and Kiev city council members on a cruise along the Dnieper 
River, a newspaper reported Tuesday. The mine was found hidden in 
a sofa as security agents checked the boat just before Saturday's 
cruise, Oleksandr Zarubytsky, a spokesman for Kiev's Interior Ministry, 
told the daily Kievskiye Vedomosti. ``The mine had a low explosive 
force but still could have seriously injured or even caused mortal 
wounds to any person who sat on the sofa,'' Zarubytsky said. ``Judging 
by its location, it's hard to say that the mine was meant to blow 
up a concrete passenger or boat crew member. It's also difficult to 
say whether the goal was to kill, intimidate, or ruin the cruise,'' 
he added. The mine was rendered harmless, the report said. Police 
have launched an investigation into the case, which they qualified 
as illegal weapons possession.
