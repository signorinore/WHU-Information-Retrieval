Romania is prepared to send medics and backup equipment to the region 
in case of a NATO air strike in Kosovo but not weapons and combat 
troops, a top military official was quoted as saying Tuesday. The 
daily Adevarul quoted Gen. Constantin Degeratu, Romania's chief of 
staff, that a larger outlay would constitute a waste of government 
funds in the economically struggling country. Romania has an army 
of 200,000 soldiers, some of whom did peacekeeping duty in Bosnia 
and Angola. The country has also offered NATO the airport at Timisoara, 
a city near the border with Yugoslavia, some 425 kilometers (265 miles) 
northwest of Bucharest. Degeratu's statement was confirmed by the 
Defense Ministry press office.
