Romania's top three forwards, Adrian Ilie, Radu Niculescu and Gheorghe 
Craioveanu, will miss upcoming European qualifiers, sports media reported 
Tuesday. Romania plays Portugal Oct. 10 and Hungary Oct. 14. ``Our 
strikers fall like flies,'' Pro Sport sport magazine wrote Tuesday. 
Romania's team doctor announced that Adrian Ilie, nicknamed ``The 
Cobra,'' who plays for Spain's Valencia, had a ruptured thigh muscle 
and is under a special medical treatment. ``We'll try to do our best 
to recover him until the game with Hungary,'' Pompiliu Popescu told 
the national radio station. Gheorghe Craioveanu who plays for Spain's 
Villareal, was recently suspended two games by FIFA for offending 
a referee, while Radu Niculescu has strained his right leg muscle. 
Romania's coach Victor Piturca would probably call up Adrian Mihalcea, 
Viorel Moldovan and Ionel Danciulescu as replacements, the national 
soccer federation said in a statement.
