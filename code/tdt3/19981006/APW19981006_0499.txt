Searching for a breakthrough to avert NATO airstrikes, a senior U.S. 
envoy said Tuesday that President Slobodan Milosevic has not met the 
terms laid down by the United Nations to prevent military intervention 
in the secessionist Kosovo province. Following difficult talks with 
Milosevic late Monday, Richard Holbrooke met in the Kosovo capital 
with ethnic Albanian political leaders, who have refused to negotiate 
with Milosevic until he halts a seven-month crackdown against separatists 
rebels, which has killed hundreds and driven more than a quarter-million 
people from their homes. Holbrooke told reporters that Serbian military 
police still maintain a strong presence in Kosovo despite repeated 
international demands for them to withdraw from areas of conflict. 
``U.S. diplomatic observers are doing a terrific job bringing us information, 
and the information they're bringing is not good,'' he told reporters 
before heading into talks with ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim 
Rugova, who says NATO airstrikes would be welcome. Holbrooke was expected 
to return to Belgrade for Tuesday night meeting with Milosevic on 
the southern province in Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. 
Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo population, 
and most favor self-rule. In Jerusalem, U.S. State Department spokesman 
James P. Rubin said Holbrooke spoke by telephone twice with Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright about the results of his talks in the 
Yugoslav capital, Belgrade. ``President Milosevic has not agreed at 
this time to ... sustainable and irreversible compliance with the 
demands of the international community,'' Rubin said. ``NATO military 
preparations and discussions and decision-making continue on a fast 
track.'' Milosevic told Holbrooke late Monday that his government 
is willing to seek a ``political solution'' to the crisis in Kosovo, 
where ethnic Albanian rebels are battling for independence. But he 
also called the threats of aggression against Yugoslavia ``a criminal 
act'' that provide ``support for the Albanian villains, not the Albanian 
people,'' according to a statement issued through state media. His 
defiant comments came after a meeting in which Holbrooke told the 
Yugoslav president of the ``the grave situation we are facing.'' ``If 
he thinks NATO is bluffing, if he is willing to take that risk, all 
I can do is convey the views of the U.S. government,'' Holbrooke told 
reporters Tuesday in Pristina. Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 
agreement that ended the Bosnian war, was dispatched to the federal 
Yugoslav capital of Belgrade in what appeared to give Milosevic a 
last chance to halt his crackdown and enter talks with ethnic Albanians 
on the future of the province. But there was no sign that the diplomatic 
deadlock was ending. Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the 
Interfax news agency that Russia, a staunch ally of Serbia, would 
use its veto to stop any move to approve airstrikes on Yugoslavia 
by the U.N. Security Council, which was set to take up Kosovo later 
Tuesday. The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic 
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three years 
a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. But the ethnic 
Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic, and Albright voiced 
skepticism Milosevic would adhere to any such plan in any case. ``We 
are dealing with someone we never trusted,'' Albright told reporters 
en route from Washington to Jerusalem. A representative of the Kosovo 
Liberation Army on Tuesday urged NATO to intervene. Adem Demaci, who 
resigned as KLA spokesman last month but said he was again speaking 
for the rebels, said: ``The Serbian war machine and its military and 
political structure must be destroyed.'' NATO officials say they are 
ready to launch airstrikes within hours of receiving an order to attack. 
No final decision is expected until Thursday, when ambassadors of 
the allied countries gather for a NATO Council meeting in Brussels. 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin continued to press for a political 
solution to the crisis on Tuesday. ``I have spent almost two days 
preparing and holding telephone talks on Kosovo,'' he told Russian 
news agencies. French President Jacques Chirac insisted that the U.N. 
Security Council must authorize any military intervention, but indicated 
that the human suffering going on might be the loophole NATO needs 
to go in, and that France would go along with that. ``It is necessary 
that the Serb forces pull out,'' he said in Florence, Italy. ``Combat 
must cease. If that is not the case, a NATO intervention will become 
inevitable.''
