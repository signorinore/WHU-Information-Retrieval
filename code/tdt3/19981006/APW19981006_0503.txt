Israel's army has decided to dismantle parts of the tomb of the Hebron 
mosque massacre gunman in an effort to discourage Jewish extremists 
from making pilgrimages to the site, a lawyer in the case said Tuesday. 
The gunman, New York-born Baruch Goldstein, opened fire on Muslim 
worshipers in the Tomb of the Patriarchs in the West Bank town of 
Hebron in February 1994, killing 29 people before being bludgeoned 
to death by survivors. Over the years, Goldstein's grave in a small 
park in the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, adjacent to Hebron, 
has been turned into a shrine that has drawn many ultranationalist 
Jews. The army informed Goldstein's family in a letter Sunday that 
parts of the shrine would be removed, said the family's lawyer, Naftali 
Werzberger. The engraving on the tombstone, which refers to Goldstein 
as ``holy'' and a ``martyr,'' is to be altered, Werzberger said. The 
two words are to be removed. On Tuesday, the Goldstein family petitioned 
the Supreme Court to prevent any changes at the tomb, which includes 
elaborate lighting, benches, a glass cabinet for prayer books, a limestone 
plaza and rose bushes. In the petition, the Goldsteins said the army 
had granted all the necessary licenses for erecting the shrine and 
acted under political pressure in reversing its position now. Werzberger 
said tampering with the grave site would incite angry reactions from 
Goldstein's supporters. Army comment was not immediately available 
Tuesday.
