A magistrate Tuesday ordered the police officer in charge of the investigation 
into the slaying five months ago of a Rwandan opposition leader to 
appear in court to explain why he has not yet presented any evidence 
against three men arrested for the crime. Senior resident magistrate 
Christine Meoli issued the order to appear Oct. 21 after the prosecution 
told the court the evidence files were not ready. A Rwandan, a Kenyan 
and an Ugandan were arrested several days after former Rwandan Interior 
Minister Seth Sendashonga was gunned down May 16 with his driver at 
a busy Nairobi intersection. The accused are Rwandan David Akiki Kiwanuka, 
Kenyan Charles Wamuthoni Muhanji and Ugandan Christopher Ruganda Mulunda. 
Sendashonga was living in exile in Kenya after being dismissed from 
the Rwandan government in August 1995. Once she has the evidence files, 
the magistrate said she will decide whether to refer the accused to 
the high court to stand trial for murder or release them. The accused 
have been held without bail since May. After the arrests, police spokesman 
Njeru Kianda said a Rwandan Tutsi businessman living in Nairobi had 
confessed to ordering Sendashonga's death to avenge the killing of 
the man's father on the former minister's orders. Sendashonga was 
a member of the predominantly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front that ousted 
a Hutu extremist government in Rwanda in July 1994 that ordered a 
three-month genocide campaign in which more than 500,000 people, mostly 
minority Tutsis, were killed. Sendashonga and several other government 
officials were dismissed from their posts in 1995 after they protested 
the reprisal killings of Hutu civilians by Tutsi soldiers.
