Palestinians blamed Israel on Tuesday for the death of a Palestinian 
from Yemen who had been held in an Israeli jail for illegally entering 
the country. Ahmed Asfour, 23, and a Yemenite citizen, tried to hang 
himself in his prison cell last month after being held for 10 months, 
said a spokeswoman for the Israeli Prisons Authority, Orit Messer-Harel. 
Asfour was transferred unconscious and in serious condition to a hospital 
where he died three days later, said Messer-Harel. In December 1997, 
Israel had sentenced Asfour to six months for trying to enter Israel 
illegally through the Gaza Strip. He was still being held after the 
end of his sentence as the Israeli government tried to get Yemen to 
accept him in return, she said. The Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring 
Group said Asfour's arrest was illegal. ``The death of Asfour stresses 
the negligence of the Israeli government with regards to Palestinian 
lives,'' the group said in a release. Asfour had entered the Gaza 
Strip from Yemen with Israeli permission to visit his family in 1995. 
His permit expired and he did not leave the country.
