Poland and Iran last week signed an economic agreement protecting 
investments in each country and avoiding double taxation, Economic 
Minister Janusz Steinhoff's office announced Tuesday. The agreement 
was signed Oct. 1 during Steinhoff's visit to Iran for talks with 
government officials and a meeting of the Polish-Iranian Ministerial 
Committee for Trade and Economic Cooperation, said Economic Ministry 
spokesman Pawel Badzio. Steinhoff met with Mohammad Shariatmadari, 
the Iranian trade minister, to discuss trade between the countries, 
which totaled dlrs 92 million in 1997, about double the figure for 
the previous year. Poland exports steel products, fertilizers, electric 
equipment and machine parts to Iran, which exports oil products, fruit, 
nuts and aluminum products to Poland. The United States has imposed 
sanctions against Iran for promoting terrorism, but some European 
countries, including many in the European Union, have continued to 
deal with Tehran. Poland hopes to join the European Union in five 
years.
