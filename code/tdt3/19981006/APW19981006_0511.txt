A Continental Airlines twin-engine Boeing 777 on a test flight from 
New York to Tokyo made an emergency landing in northern Japan Tuesday 
because of engine trouble, an airport spokesman said. The plane landed 
safely at 2:25 p.m. (0525 GMT) carrying 84 Continental Airlines officials 
and crew members, said Tetsuya Watanabe at New Chitose airport, 829 
kilometers (518 miles) northeast of Tokyo. The pilot had discovered 
that one engine was consuming an excessive amount of oil, said Watanabe. 
He said the cause of the trouble was not immediately known. Watanabe 
said the plane would leave Chitose for Tokyo Wednesday evening. Continental 
Airlines is scheduled to begin daily non-stop service between Newark, 
New Jersey, and Tokyo on Dec. 1 and daily non-stop service between 
Houston, Texas, and Tokyo on Jan. 31, said Kenji Makino, an official 
of the Transport Ministry's aviation department.
