A Japanese journalist accused by Chinese authorities of illegally 
possessing secret documents was expelled from China and returned home 
Tuesday, a spokesman for his newspaper said. Yukihisa Nakatsu, 39, 
the Beijing correspondent for the Yomiuri, Japan's largest-circulation 
daily, was questioned three times by Chinese authorities after returning 
from Tibet last month, the spokesman said, speaking on the customary 
condition of anonymity. Chinese authorities searched Nakatsu's home 
and demanded to know where he had obtained certain documents they 
had found, the newspaper said. The spokesman refused to say what the 
documents were, or whether the Chinese had objected to any specific 
reports in the Yomiuri. Nakatsu, who refused to tell the Chinese authorities 
the source of the documents, was ordered Sunday to leave China within 
three days. Yomiuri managing editor Shoichi Oikawa defended Nakatsu's 
actions and said he was confident Nakatsu had engaged in ethical and 
proper reporting. ``We believe that his refusal to disclose the sources 
of those documents follows the rules of ethics of journalism,'' he 
said. ``There will be no change in the Yomiuri stance to pursue fair 
reporting of China.''
