Foreign direct investment in Thailand in this year's first five months 
roughly equaled 1997's full-year total of about 104 billion baht (dlrs 
2.6 billion at current exchange rates), the head of the country's 
investment board said Tuesday. Along with other promising economic 
indicators, the figures support the idea that Thailand will be the 
first country to recover from the economic crisis that struck the 
region last year, Board of Investment Secretary-General Staporn Kavitanon 
said. While gross domestic product is likely to decline around 8 percent 
this year, Staporn said, export figures are healthy. He said the Board 
of Investment estimated that 1998 exports will exceed dlrs 53 billion, 
while imports will decline, leaving Thailand a trade surplus of about 
dlrs 11.5 billion. He said the current account was projected to show 
a surplus of dlrs 15 billion, or 14 percent of GDP. ``While the value 
of Thai exports is likely to decline in U.S. dollar terms, the volume 
of exports has risen by an estimated 14 percent through the first 
seven months of 1998,'' Staporn was quoted saying in a news release 
from his office. Comparisons in dollar terms are difficult to make 
because the Thai baht has lost about one-third of its value since 
it was allowed to float against the dollar in July 1997. Speaking 
at a meeting of Thai and British businessmen, Staporn said exports 
of computers, canned seafood, rubber products, automobiles and components 
were showing double-digit growth in dollar terms, and ``traditional 
exports such as rice and garments are ahead of last year's pace.'' 
Staporn said British companies such as Boots, Unilever and Shell had 
recently expanded their investments in Thailand, and Britain's largest 
retailer, Tesco, has recently entered the market. He said the Board 
of Investment had liberalized joint-venture rules to permit foreigners 
to own the majority of shares in existing manufacturing projects with 
the consent of Thai shareholders. The policy had seen 137 foreign 
companies invest more than 16 billion baht (dlrs 410 million), he 
said. To aid them in competing internationally, the investment board 
had offered further assistance to manufacturers by granting import 
duty exemptions and relaxing zoning requirements, he said.
