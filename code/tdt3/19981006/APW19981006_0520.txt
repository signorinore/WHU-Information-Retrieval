With tax revenues shrinking by the month, President Boris Yeltsin 
on Tuesday ordered tougher tax enforcement on a familiar target: the 
country's huge alcohol industry. The government, which already plays 
a major role in regulating the industry, now intends to have a controlling 
stake in all 184 distilleries that make pure alcohol so they can more 
easily collect taxes, officials said. In most cases, the government 
already has a controlling stake in them. The companies that buy alcohol 
from the distilleries to make name brands, such as Stolichnaya and 
Smirnov vodka, will remain in private hands, and the government does 
not intend to nationalize these firms, Deputy Prime Minister Gennady 
Kulik said. ``The government's key objective is to establish order 
in the industry and to protect the alcohol market from inferior products,'' 
Kulik was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency. But the government 
also wants more tax money. In Soviet times, alcohol taxes amounted 
to about 25 percent of the federal budget. Today, the figure is around 
2 to 4 percent, according to officials. The problem is that about 
half of the alcohol consumed in Russia _ mostly vodka _ goes untaxed, 
according to government estimates. Some state-licensed distilleries 
are believed to be producing alcohol that they do not report to the 
government, and bootleggers also make large quantities of cheap, untaxed 
booze. The Finance Ministry has estimated that the new plan could 
add around 30 billion rubles (dlrs 2 billion) to the state budget 
each year. Kulik claimed the retail price of alcohol would not rise, 
and that the plan was aimed at enforcing existing tax laws. The Russian 
government has been seeking to collect around 14 billion rubles (dlrs 
933 million) a month. But it rarely reaches the target, and tax collections 
dipped to just 9.3 billion rubles (dlrs 620 million) last month, due 
largely to the country's economic crisis. Alcohol remains cheap and 
plentiful in Russia, with a bottle of vodka going for about 30 rubles 
(dlrs 2).
