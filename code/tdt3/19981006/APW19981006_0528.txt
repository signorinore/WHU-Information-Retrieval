Embattled Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasrin, as well as Islamic extremists 
seeking her death for alleged blasphemy, have both crossed the line, 
Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Tuesday. Extremists 
have been calling for the death of Nasrin, who returned last month 
to Bangladesh. A newspaper quoted her in 1994 as saying the Koran, 
the Islamic holy book, should be rewritten, but she says she was misquoted. 
``The Islamic groups are overreacting ... but Taslima should also 
know that there is limit to freedom of expression,'' Hasina told The 
Associated Press in an interview in her first public remarks about 
the protests now raging in the country. Hasina said free speech ``does 
not mean the right to hurt one's religious sentiments,'' but added 
her government would not allow anyone to violate the law in response. 
Nasrin has been in hiding since returning to Bangladesh last month 
after four years of exile in Europe and the United States to be with 
her mother, who has colon cancer. She has asked the government to 
protect her from assassination because extremists have offered a 200,000-taka 
(dlrs-5,000) reward to anyone who kills her. Asked about the writer's 
request, the prime minister said Nasrin should face a warrant for 
her arrest and surrender. ``She should go to the court. There is a 
rule of law in this country,'' Hasina said. On Sunday, riot police 
fired tear gas at 2,000 protestors and arrested 12 of them, touching 
off more street protests in the Bangladesh capital and a general strike 
Monday in the northeastern town of Sylhet. Nasrin also faces an arrest 
warrant that a Dhaka magistrate revived in a civil suit, in a second 
blasphemy case filed in addition to the charges brought by the state. 
Though she was freed on bail in the state-sponsored criminal case 
and permitted to leave the country in 1994, she now needs to seek 
bail in the second case. If convicted of blasphemy, the writer could 
be sentenced to maximum two years in jail. ``I want my freedom back,'' 
she told The Associated Press from her hide-out in an earlier interview. 
``This is my country and I've every right to live here.''
