KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukraine would support any U.N. Security Council 
resolution to allow NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia, a Foreign 
Ministry official said Tuesday. Kiev would ``unconditionally support'' 
such a decision, said the head of the ministry's political analysis 
department, Andriy Veselovsky. But Veselovsky also urged caution over 
the conflict in Kosovo, a mostly ethnic Albanian and separatist-minded 
province in southern Yugoslavia. ``The United Nations Security Council 
is expressing the joint will of the world community, and such a decision 
should be taken only on the basis of a comprehensive study of the 
situation and on the condition that all other methods have been exhausted,'' 
he said. Ukraine seeks a peaceful solution to the crisis, and the 
apparent withdrawal of some Yugoslav forces from Kosovo shows that 
this possibility still exists, Veselovsky noted. Separately, Ukraine's 
parliament adopted a resolution Tuesday calling on the world community 
to avoid force and resolve the Kosovo conflict by peaceful methods. 
It said a solution to the crisis could be found in talks on autonomy 
for Kosovo within Yugoslavia. The leftist-dominated legislature, echoing 
its counterparts in neighboring Russia, stressed that NATO airstrikes 
on the Serbs over Kosovo might spark a much wider Balkan and European 
conflict. Russia, which strongly opposes the use of force against 
the Serbs, its traditional allies and Orthodox Slavic brethren, says 
it is willing to use its veto in the Security Council to stop possible 
NATO airstrikes.
