Amid calls for revitalizing the party by promoting younger members 
and more women, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's defeated Christian Democrats 
closed ranks Tuesday behind a new leader _ Kohl's own right-hand man. 
The party's executive committee voted unanimously to recommend as 
chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble, Kohl's parliamentary faction leader and 
the man he handpicked as his replacement. A final vote is to be made 
at a party convention on Nov. 7. The choice of Schaeuble came despite 
criticism from some party members that a bolder break was needed from 
Kohl, who led the Christian Democrats in last week's election to its 
worst showing in 50 years. Kohl insisted there was ``no bitterness'' 
during the closed meeting. ``There was no criticism at all directed 
at me,'' he said. ``Others were criticized for what they said before 
the session,'' he added, apparently referring to calls for party renewal 
while refusing to name names. The Christian Democratic Union has dominated 
German postwar politics by attracting a wide range of conservative 
voters. But young members in particular worry that the party has lost 
touch with the national mood during Kohl's 25-year chairmanship and 
his 16 years as chancellor. ``It's incomprehensible that Kohl again 
says what's coming,'' Christian Wulff, party chief in Lower Saxony 
state, was quoted as saying Monday. He is among five candidates running 
for four deputy chair positions at the convention next month. Only 
one is a woman _ Kohl's outgoing Environment Minister Angela Merkel. 
Rita Suessmuth, a Christian Democrat who will be losing her post as 
parliamentary president, called for the party to bring more women 
to top posts. ``Women in the CDU are ready to help renew, but are 
not being included,'' she told Stern magazine in an interview published 
Tuesday. She called for replacing the outgoing party secretary, Peter 
Hintze, with a woman. ``That's overdue and needs no additional reason,'' 
she said. Kohl declined to comment on her suggestion, saying that 
was a decision for Schaeuble now to make. He also said there was no 
discussion about a future official role for him in the party. Some 
reports suggested he might be made honorary chairman. ``My party is 
my home,'' he said. ``I'll give my advice when asked. Otherwise I'll 
enjoy life ... and fulfill my duties'' as a regular member of parliament. 
In a jovial spirit, he added: ``I've heard people say they can't imagine 
that a former chancellor just sits in (parliament). I say, `Well I'm 
not going to stand. I'm going to sit.'''
