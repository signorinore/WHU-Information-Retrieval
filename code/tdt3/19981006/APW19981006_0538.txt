A woman chained herself to a radiator in an attempt to force a Moscow 
bank to return her deposit, a news agency said Tuesday. The woman 
entered a branch of the Russian Credit Bank on Tuesday afternoon and 
demanded her money, Interfax said. When she was refused, she handcuffed 
herself to a radiator and said she would not leave until she got her 
money. Many Russian banks either do not have money because of the 
country's current economic crisis or have frozen customers' accounts.
