France's top leaders gave Premier Romano Prodi's precarious government 
a morale boost Tuesday but chided Italy for keeping interest rates 
too high, a potential risk for recession. French Prime Minister Lionel 
Jospin and President Jacques Chirac called for even stronger cooperation 
with Rome to help Europe's economy, deal with global financial crises 
and map foreign policy. At the end of a two-day Italian-French summit, 
an annual appointment to take stock of bilateral relations and European 
and world concerns, Jospin stressed the importance of Italian political 
stability and expressed ``profound respect for the Italian government.'' 
Prodi this week is battling to keep his center-left majority alive, 
after his Communist allies decided to oppose his 1999 budget, which 
was tailored to keep Rome in line with European Monetary Union rules. 
With the French leaders at his side in a frescoed salon of 14th-century 
Palazzo Vecchio, Florence's town hall, Prodi called the political 
turn against him a ``cloud'' threatening his government's ``long and 
fruitful phase of political stability'' that allowed Rome to improve 
its financial house and become a charter member of the euro currency 
club. But ``there are no clouds'' in French-Italian relations, Prodi 
said, obviously grateful for the praise reaped on him by Jospin and 
Chirac. However, Prodi admitted that in their talks, which begin Monday 
evening and continued Tuesday morning, the French ``expressly asked 
that Italy lower its interest rates.'' Italy's discount rate stands 
at 5 percent, and Italy's government and markets, as well as others 
aboard, have been calling for the central bank to cut the rate to 
reduce the risk of recession. Saying Rome agreed with Paris on Kosovo, 
Chirac went on to press Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw 
forces from Kosovo and warned that NATO intervention could come within 
days if the Serb didn't comply.
