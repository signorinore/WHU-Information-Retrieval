Michael Jordan says the money _ almost pocket change by his standards 
_ wasn't the reason he didn't go through with making the basketball 
movie ``Heaven is a Playground.'' The Chicago Bulls star denied in 
court Monday that he failed to go through with making the 1991 flop 
because of the dlrs 350,000 paycheck. Later, Jordan signed a dlrs 
4 million deal to make ``Space Jam,'' a box office success. Jordan 
and agent David Falk contend the producers of ``Heaven is a Playground'' 
failed to come up with adequate financing for the movie. The movie 
ultimately was made with former Loyola Marymount star Bo Kimble in 
the role Jordan was to have played. The producers are seeking between 
dlrs 16 million and dlrs 20 million in damages, or what they believe 
could have been the film's profit. Jordan maintains both sides agreed 
to postpone the film, and he has countersued, alleging that the producers 
knowingly misled him about financing.
