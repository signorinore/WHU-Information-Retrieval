The head of Italy's soccer players' union has called for a six-month 
strike to protest the handling of the doping scandal which has engulfed 
the Serie A. Sergio Campana said the inquiries into the use of banned 
substances in Italy's first division had violated players' rights 
to privacy. ``The players are the first ones to feel indignation by 
this daily release of names and precise references to players and 
teams,'' Campana said Monday night. ``There have been macroscopic 
violations of privacy.'' The union head said no names should be mentioned 
until prosecutors had completed their investigations. Prosecutors 
in Bologna and Torino have been carrying out doping inquiries since 
this summer when AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman suggested two Juventus 
players had used illegal substances. Anti-doping investigators at 
the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI) have also opened an inquiry. 
The fallout caused the resignation of CONI president Mario Pescante 
and the firing of the chief of CONI's drug-testing laboratory. Serie-A 
players caused an uproar in March 1996 when they failed to turn up 
for weekend games to protest what they said were unfair working conditions. 
``If the results (of the inquiry) show that players voluntarily broke 
anti-doping regulations then they should be punished for ruining soccer's 
image,'' Campana said.
