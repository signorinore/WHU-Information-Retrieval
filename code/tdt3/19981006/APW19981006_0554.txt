The Russian economic crisis and the annual summer lull have resulted 
in a growing foreign trade deficit in the first eight months of the 
year, a Trade Ministry official said Tuesday. According to preliminary 
data, exports amounted to dlrs 14,176 billion and imports to dlrs 
16,103 billion. The resulting dlrs 1.93 billion deficit is dlrs 341 
million more than in the same period last year. ``If worst comes to 
worst, exports can drop by dlrs 250-350 million by the end of the 
year,'' deputy State Secretary Gyoergy Gilyan told a news conference. 
``That drop isn't staggering when compared to the dlrs 22 billion, 
Hungary's total exports projected for 1998.'' Hungary's exports to 
Russia were four percent of the country's total, down from 5.1 percent 
over the same period in 1997.
