Iraqi expatriates are pressing the government to ease restrictions 
on travel, transfer of capital and ownership of property as a first 
step toward opening up to the outside world. Some 800 of them have 
gathered in Baghdad for a government-sponsored conference, and many 
said Tuesday they came only after the government assured them they 
will be allowed to leave without difficulty. No official figures are 
available on the number of Iraqis living abroad, but the expatriates 
say nearly a million Iraqis have fled in the past eight years, mainly 
due to hardships caused by U.N. trade sanctions. Meenas Shamu'il, 
a resident of Chicago, said about 500,000 Iraqis live in the United 
States but only a handful attended the three-day conference that began 
Monday. ``We need to see a lot of change here before bringing our 
money to our own country,'' said Shamu'il. Iraq does not allow dual-citizenship, 
and Iraqis with foreign passports are not allowed to trade on Baghdad's 
stock exchange. Iraqis also are not allowed to leave the country with 
more than dlrs 50. In addition, they have to buy an exit visa for 
400,000 dinars (dlrs 266). President Saddam Hussein, however, waived 
the fee for those attending the conference, which included 300 Iraqis 
from Romania. Just a few Iraqis lived in Romania before the sanctions 
were imposed for Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The number since 
has increased to 30,000, said Ahmed al-Ujeil, head of Iraqi community 
in Romania. ``These are not political or economic refugees but Iraqis 
with a lot of money,'' he told The Associated Press. ``We have many 
who are multimillionaires but would not invest a dime in the country,'' 
he added. Saleh Abed Alwan, an Iraqi journalist living in France, 
said he doubted the government would soften its attitude regarding 
travel and investment. He said he has been in France for more than 
15 years and still finds it difficult to send money to his family 
in Iraq. Qahatan al-Ubeid, from Germany, said most Iraqis living abroad 
would like to visit their homeland but they ``do not want to do it 
with an Iraqi passport.'' ``There are so many restrictions. We need 
to see them removed to be able to come and go like the citizens of 
the countries we live in,'' he said. Iraq organized a similar conference 
in 1996 in a bid to renew links between Iraqi expatriates and their 
homeland.
