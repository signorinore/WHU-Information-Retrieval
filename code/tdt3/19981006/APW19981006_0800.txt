Police injured 10 teachers seriously when they broke up a meeting 
with clubs and whips as a nationwide teacher's strike entered its 
second day Tuesday. Ambrose Adongo, the head of the Kenya National 
Union of Teachers, or KNUT, called the strike by 260,000 primary, 
secondary and technical school teachers a success. The beatings occurred 
in Karachuonyo, about 240 kilometers (145 miles) northwest of Nairobi, 
when police broke up a gathering of teachers discussing the strike 
on the grounds it was illegal. ``Armed police stormed our meeting 
... and opened fire, ordering everybody to lie down flat,'' said KNUT 
official Peter Okeyo Okul. ``The police then descended on us with 
truncheons, whips and gun butts, injuring 10 of our colleagues.'' 
The strike, which has left 7 million students idle, coincides with 
high school final examinations. President Daniel arap Moi's government 
agreed a year ago to raise teachers' salaries by up to 200 percent 
over five years in a desperate bid to end a 12-day strike before general 
elections last December. Moi, who has ruled Kenya for 20 years and 
is serving his last constitutional term, was also worried the strike 
might hurt his chances of re-election. After paying only the first 
increment of the five-part pay hike, in July the government said it 
had no money to pay the rest. Education Minister Kalonzo Musyoka said 
if the raises agreed to were put into effect, 80 percent of his ministry's 
1998-99 budget of dlrs 733 million would go to pay salaries. Adongo 
told a news conference in Nairobi the union is willing to negotiate 
another schedule of increments and call off the strike, but he insisted 
the government must present a firm offer. ``We are still ready for 
dialogue, and we will call off the strike anytime as long as there 
are continued talks between us and the government,'' Adongo said. 
Before the strike, union officials complained the government made 
no offer, insisting only that it had no money. There were no reports 
of strike-related violence in other parts of the country Tuesday. 
On Monday, police broke up teachers demonstrations in several towns 
and cities, including Nairobi and the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa.
