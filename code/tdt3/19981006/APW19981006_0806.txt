Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday he would go ahead with 
construction in a Jewish enclave in the West Bank town of Hebron but 
that the work would not begin until an archaeological salvage dig 
has been conducted. With the announcement, Netanyahu apparently tried 
to please both Jewish settlers pressing for a quick start of construction 
and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright who has demanded a 
halt to settlement expansion. The future of the Jewish enclave of 
Tel Romeida, a cluster of mobile homes in Hebron, was raised as Albright 
visited the region. Last month, in response to the killing of a settler 
rabbi in his Tel Romeida trailer, Netanyahu said he would replace 
the mobile homes with permanent structures. The rabbi was stabbed 
to death, apparently by a Palestinian militant. On Tuesday, Netanyahu 
made several contradictory statement and his intentions were not immediately 
clear. During a news conference with Albright, Netanyahu said the 
mobile homes in Tel Romeida would only be reinforced to make them 
bulletproof. ``I want to remind you that this is not construction,'' 
Netanyahu said. ``We are not speaking of expanding the settlement 
to other territories.'' A statement by his office said that archeological 
digs would have to be carried out in the neighborhood before building 
could begin. Israeli officials said the dig could take several months. 
But Netanyahu said in the statement that the activity would entail 
actual construction of ``permanent structures,'' apparently more than 
the simple reinforcement of buildings. Palestinian chief negotiator 
Saeb Erekat told Israel radio that the decision to build in Hebron 
was a violation of peace agreements and will cause tension particularly 
because it coincides with Albright's meeting with Netanyahu. Albright 
chose to sidestep the issue. She said both sides should avoid unilateral 
action, but said she would not comment on the Tel Romeida issue. Baruch 
Marzel, a resident of Tel Romeida and a former leader of the outlawed 
anti-Arab movement Kach, said Netanyahu was backing down on his promise 
to build in the area. ``He is cheating the Israeli people,'' Marzel 
said.
