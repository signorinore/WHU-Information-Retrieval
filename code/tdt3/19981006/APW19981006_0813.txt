Shuttling between Ankara and Damascus, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 
tried Tuesday to avert a feared war between Turkey and Syria over 
Kurdish rebels. In three hours of closed-door talks with Mubarek, 
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel upheld his nation's position that 
Syria is harboring rebel Kurds who perpetrate cross-border attacks 
on Turkey. Turkey is threatening force against Syria, which denies 
the accusation. ``We are warning Syria for the last time to cease 
its support to the separatist organization and abandon its hostile 
policy against Turkey,'' Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz told Parliament 
on Tuesday. After Ankara, Mubarak and his delegation headed back to 
Damascus late Tuesday for what appeared to be a second round of talks 
with Syrian leaders on the crisis. ``We have talked to the Syrians. 
We have talked to the Turks,'' Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa 
told reporters before leaving for Damascus. ``I hope that we will 
be able to defuse the situation.'' Demirel showed the Egyptian leader 
Turkish intelligence reports allegedly showing that Syria sheltered 
a Kurdish rebel leader and his guerrillas in Damascus, in other Syrian 
cities and in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of Lebanon, a Turkish 
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity, said. Libyan leader 
Moammar Gadhafi weighed in on Syria's side Tuesday, saying ``any aggression 
against Syria will be considered as an aggression against Libya according 
to the Arab joint defense pact.'' The United States, along with most 
countries of the Middle East, urged the two countries to reach a peaceful 
solution. Mubarak held talks with Syrian President Hafez Assad on 
Sunday. Turkey played down Mubarak's role as a go-between, stating 
that there was no need for mediation between the two countries. Relations 
between Turkey and Syria have always been troublesome. Damascus is 
uneasy with Ankara's plans to build dams on the Euphrates River, a 
key source of water for Syria, while Turkey accuses Damascus of having 
designs on a Turkish border province, Hatay, which has a sizable Arab 
population. Syria also feels threatened by the bolstering military 
and diplomatic ties between Turkey and Israel. But the recent rise 
in tension appears part of Ankara's push to end fighting in a 14-year-old 
Kurdish insurgency in which 37,000 people have died. Turkey has reportedly 
sent 10,000 troops to its border with Syria. Newspapers have suggested 
that its forces could stage raids on rebel camps in the Bekaa Valley.
