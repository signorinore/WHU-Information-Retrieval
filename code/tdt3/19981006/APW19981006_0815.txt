The parliament of Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner in Yugoslavia, 
warned Tuesday against NATO intervention in Kosovo, but demanded that 
Yugoslavia fully comply with all international demands over the Serbian 
province. Montenegro's pro-western leadership has criticized the policies 
of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, including the seven-month 
crackdown on Kosovo Albanians that has led to NATO planning for air 
strikes to stop the bloodshed. Montenegro's parliament is dominated 
by Milosevic's opponents. But the parliament warned against NATO intervention 
as costly in human lives, property damage and possibly counterproductive 
by strengthening ``the position of the supporters of the radical options 
over Kosovo.'' In an oblique slap at Milosevic, parliament demanded 
that ``those who are responsible for a negative stand by the international 
community toward our country'' meet all international demands on Kosovo.
