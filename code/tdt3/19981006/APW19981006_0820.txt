The prospect of NATO airstrikes moved ominously closer Tuesday as 
a top U.S. envoy warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that 
he has not met U.N. demands for a peaceful solution to the crisis 
in embattled Kosovo province. Richard Holbrooke was to meet the Yugoslav 
president for the second day Tuesday after visiting the southern Serbian 
province, where the Yugoslav forces were battling ethnic Albanian 
rebels seeking independence. In Kosovo, where he met ethnic Albanian 
political leaders, Holbrooke said that Serbian security forces still 
maintain a strong presence, despite U.N. demands for them to withdraw 
from areas of conflict and allow political settlement. ``U.S. diplomatic 
observers are doing a terrific job bringing us information, and the 
information they're bringing is not good,'' Holbrooke told reporters. 
His statement appeared to signal that international military action 
moved ominously closer to stop Milosevic's crackdown against the secessionists, 
which has killed hundreds and left tens of thousands ethnic Albanians 
homeless. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. 
But ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo 
population, and most favor self-rule. In Washington, U.S. President 
Bill Clinton said Holbrooke was telling the Yugoslav leader ``what 
he must do and to make clear that NATO is prepared to act if President 
Milosevic fails to honor the United Nations resolutions.'' ``The stakes 
are high,'' Clinton said. ``The time is now to end the violence in 
Kosovo.'' U.S. Defense Secretary Cohen told the Congress a pullback 
of troops in Kosovo by Milosevic was not enough to ward off NATO attacks. 
Any such air strikes might be followed by some form of ``international 
presence'' on the ground, he said. Cohen justified the prospective 
use of air power. ``He (Milosevic) stands to lose a substantial portion 
of his military capability ... There is a lot that can and will be 
done by air,'' Cohen said. If more Serb forces don't pull out of the 
province as demanded, NATO intervention ``will become inevitable,'' 
French President Jacques Chirac said. However, Yugoslav deputy Information 
Secretary Miodrag Popovic told the Associated Press Television News 
that the complete withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from Kosovo is out 
of question. ``Who in the right mind would do so? Is there a country 
in the world that would do so, especially with an armed rebellion 
in their hands?'' Popovic asked. In Jerusalem, State Department spokesman 
James P. Rubin said Holbrooke spoke by telephone twice with Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright about the results of his talks with Milosevic. 
``President Milosevic has not agreed at this time to ... sustainable 
and irreversible compliance with the demands of the international 
community,'' Rubin said. ``NATO military preparations and discussions 
and decision-making continue on a fast track.'' Milosevic told Holbrooke 
in talks Monday night that his government is willing to seek a ``political 
solution'' to the crisis in Kosovo. But he also called the NATO threats 
against his country ``a criminal act.'' Holbrooke, who negotiated 
the 1995 agreement that ended the Bosnian war, was dispatched to the 
Yugoslav capital of Belgrade in what appeared to be a last-chance 
effort to persuade Milosevic to halt his crackdown and enter meaningful 
talks with ethnic Albanians on the future of the province. But there 
was no sign of the diplomatic deadlock ending. Russian Foreign Minister 
Igor Ivanov told the Interfax news agency that Russia, a staunch ally 
of Serbia, would use its veto to stop any move to approve airstrikes 
on Yugoslavia by the U.N. Security Council, which was set to take 
up Kosovo later Tuesday. The United States is trying to get Milosevic 
and the ethnic Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two 
or three years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. 
But the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic, 
and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright voiced skepticism Milosevic 
would adhere to any such plan in any case. ``We are dealing with someone 
we never trusted,'' Albright told reporters en route from Washington 
to Jerusalem. A representative of the Kosovo Liberation Army called 
on NATO Tuesday to intervene. Adem Demaci, who resigned as KLA spokesman 
last month but said he was again speaking for the rebels, said: ``The 
Serbian war machine and its military and political structure must 
be destroyed.'' NATO officials say they are ready to launch airstrikes 
within hours of receiving an order to attack. No final decision is 
expected until Thursday, when ambassadors of the allied countries 
gather for a NATO Council meeting in Brussels. Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin continued to press for a political solution to the crisis 
on Tuesday. ``I have spent almost two days preparing and holding telephone 
talks on Kosovo,'' he told Russian news agencies. Chirac insisted 
that the Security Council must authorize any military intervention, 
but indicated that the human suffering going on might be the loophole 
NATO needs to go in, and that France would go along with that.
