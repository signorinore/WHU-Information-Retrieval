Traditional fighters wearing threadbare dresses and womens' wigs ambushed 
barefoot rebels in densely forested eastern Sierra Leone, killing 
at least 52 renegades and wounding many others, paramilitary officers 
and troops said Tuesday. The Kamajor traditional fighters, who are 
battling to defeat the remnants of Sierra Leone's former junta and 
their rebel Revolutionary United Front allies, laid a trap late Monday 
on a road near Mandekelema village about 50 kilometers (30 miles) 
from the Liberian border, Kamajor staff officer Francis Silikie said. 
At least one Kamajor was killed and three others were missing in the 
gun-battle and hand-to-hand fighting that ensued. An unknown number 
of rebels drowned while trying to retreat across a small river, Silikie 
said. Several rebels wearing tattered civilians' clothes were taken 
prisoner in Tuesday's battle and several earlier skirmishes and were 
paraded before journalists by Kamajor officers. ``These are the lucky 
ones,'' said Silikie. ``Some of the rebel commanders killed have not 
been identified because they were completely mutilated by fighters 
for our just cause.'' The rebels, who roam the forests of eastern 
and northern Sierra Leone, are widely feared in the interior as a 
result of mass killings, rapes and mutilations of unarmed civilians. 
The Kamajors, a volunteer society of traditional hunters and fighters 
from several ethnic groups, have declared a ``patriotic war'' against 
the rebels. Although the government has said it cannot afford to pay 
them, the Kamajors are widely popular in many communities which often 
give food, toll fees and hunting weapons to the fighters in return 
for protection from rebels. The fighters believe that by dressing 
in women's clothing and wearing garlands of fetishes blessed by their 
society leaders they are made impervious to enemy bullets. Although 
the latest casualties could not be independently confirmed, journalists 
witnessed five wounded Kamajors arriving Tuesday morning in a blood-soaked 
pickup truck at the hospital in the diamond-mining town of Kenema. 
Loads of captured weapons were unloaded at the Kamajors' headquarters 
in Kenema, where dozens of battalions of the traditional fighters 
have begun amassing for a collective drive against rebel positions 
to the east. The Kamajors, who range in age from 8 to 60-years-old 
use captured guns as well as traditional weapons such as spears and 
axes against the rebels, who formed an alliance with Sierra Leone's 
former military junta. The junta and their rebel allies were ousted 
from power in February by a West African coalition force fighting 
on behalf of Sierra Leone's elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. 
Although the junta and the RUF no longer control power in the capital, 
they continue to wage war in the countryside.
