America's Devon Maitozo and Germany's Nadia Zulow won gold medals 
Tuesday in the individual vaulting at the 1998 World Equestrian Games. 
``This is a dream come true,'' said the 23-year-old Maitozo, who is 
from Cupertino, California. ``I bet with myself after winning the 
bronze (at the 1996 worlds) that 1998 would be my year to win, and 
I did.'' Maitozo, on Whiskey 191, totaled 8.890 points following a 
series of tests, which ended Tuesday with the free style at the Santa 
Barbara arena, about 30 km (20 miles) northeast of Rome. Mathias Lang 
of France, on Quitus du Madon, captured the men's silver with 8.643 
points. Germany's Henrik Ossenbrink scored 8.641 points to claim the 
bronze on Panjano. Zulow took the gold on the women's side, scoring 
8.725 points on Rainbow. American Kerith Lemon clinched the silver 
on Pasio I with 8.469 points. The 22-year-old from Soquel, California, 
has two other silver medals from the 1994 worlds in the Hague and 
the 1996 worlds in Kaposvar, Hungary. Germany's Janine Oswald, who 
was third at the 1996 championships, took home the bronze again with 
8.378 points. Vaulting originated as part of military training and 
is a sort of gymnastics on horseback. Vaulters carry out a series 
of exercises on horseback with the help of a special handle instead 
of a saddle. It is not an Olympic sport. The championships, held at 
three venues near Rome, run through Sunday.
