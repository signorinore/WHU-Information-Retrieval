The government promised to pay its dlrs 44.5 million debt to the Russian 
Space Agency before the end of the year so that it can complete a 
long-delayed component of the international space station, a top space 
official said Tuesday. The announcement followed the space agency's 
decision, announced Monday, to sell its research time on the international 
station to the United States for dlrs 60 million to raise money for 
the construction. Russia's space agency has failed to meet three target 
dates for the launch of the crew module because of a lack of funds, 
putting the whole project more than one year behind schedule. The 
Russian government's debt will be paid in three installments of dlrs 
15 million in October, November and December, Space Agency director 
Yuri Koptev said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. It is not 
clear how much money Russia needs to finish building the crew module, 
but the government payments alone are not expected to be enough, meaning 
the deal with NASA will probably stand. Space Agency spokesman Sergei 
Gorbunov said the NASA deal would not change Russia's rights and obligations 
under the dlrs 21 billion project and would not hurt Russia's space 
program. Russia would only lose research time for the period of the 
station's assembly in orbit, expected to last at least four years. 
Media reports last month said that NASA will also ask Congress and 
the White House for approval to buy up to dlrs 660 million in goods 
and services from the Russian Space Agency over the next four years 
to let it meet its obligations on the international space station. 
The project involves 16 countries, including Russia, the United States, 
Canada and Japan. A cargo module built by the Russian Khrunichev company, 
under contract with the U.S. firm Boeing, will be launched on Nov. 
20. NASA will follow in December with the launch of a second part, 
an American-built passageway. Another Russian-made module is to be 
launched in July, not in April as earlier planned.
