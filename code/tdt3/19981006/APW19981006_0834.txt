A baggage handler took an involuntary trip to Switzerland in cramped 
and chilly quarters after being trapped in the luggage container of 
a Zurich flight, a Hungarian airlines official said Tuesday. The man 
whose name was not released, took the 1 hour 20 minutes journey Monday 
in the 3.5 meters (yards)-long, 1.5 meters wide, and 1.1 meters high 
compartment of the British Aerospace 146-type aircraft, said Miklos 
Benczce, director of Malev Hungarian airways. The temperature in the 
luggage compartment was 5-6 degrees Celsius (43-43 Fahrenheit), but 
the man survived the journey safe and sound after being mistakenly 
locked in. The man returned to Budapest later Monday by another aircraft, 
this time in the passenger's cabin.
