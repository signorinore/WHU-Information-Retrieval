Labor unions on Tuesday ordered 1.2 million Norwegians to strike one 
day next week to protest a government proposal to cut national vacations 
by one day a year. Officials said the planned general strike on Oct. 
15 would be the biggest-single labor action in the history of Norway, 
a heavily-unioned country of 4.4 million people. The two-hour protest 
was expected to disrupt oil production, banks, public transit, schools, 
and many other workplaces. ``The government's proposal to remove a 
vacation day is a declaration of war against the country's workers,'' 
stated a joint communique by the four largest trade unions. Norwegians 
complain they have among the shortest vacations in Western Europe: 
four weeks plus one day paid leave per year. The Christian Democrat-led 
government of Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik on Monday presented 
a 1999 national budget that included sharp spending cuts and tax hikes 
that aim to cool off this oil-rich nation's economy before it overheats. 
The three-party minority coalition proposed reducing vacation time 
by one day to exactly four weeks. The extra day was tacked onto vacations 
in the 1980s by former Labor prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland 
as part of a failed plan to extend vacations by one day a year until 
the total reached five weeks, as is common in nieghboring Sweden and 
other European nations. It is now known as ``Gro Day.'' Eliminating 
that day while hiking taxes, fees and other costs for households was 
too much for the unions. The four groups ordered a strike by their 
1.4 million members, excluding about 200,000 who would be scheduled 
to work to handle emergency services ``It has created such strong 
reactions that we had to step in and control the form protest actions 
would take,'' said Yngve Haagensen, leader of Norway's largest union, 
called the LO.
