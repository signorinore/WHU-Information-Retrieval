Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder will have less money for new programs 
than expected because revenues next year will be 20 billion marks 
(dlrs 12 billion) less than forecast, his budget experts said Tuesday. 
Finance experts from the Social Democratic Party and the Greens, meeting 
ahead of resumed coalition talks on Wednesday, said another 20 billion 
marks is at risk in the coming years due to over-generous economic 
growth forecasts. ``The new government will have to deal with this, 
but it won't be easy,'' the Greens' Fritz Kuhn said after the meeting. 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's parliamentary faction leader, Wolfgang Schaeuble, 
denied there was any gap in the 1999 budget presented by Finance Minister 
Theo Waigel last month, calling such reports fabrications. The Social 
Democrats and Greens were to focus on finances and unemployment at 
Wednesday's talks. Cabinet posts were to be announced next week. But 
a Greens leader said Tuesday on Germany's Greens will get at least 
two posts _ foreign minister and environment minister _ in Schroeder's 
Cabinet. Juergen Trittin will be in the environment post, said Gunda 
Roestel, who co-chairs the Greens party with him. Joschka Fischer, 
who co-heads the Greens faction in parliament, will take over the 
Foreign Ministry, she said. Roestel said the party had proposed two 
female candidates as justice minister, adding that the talks with 
Schroeder's Social Democrats were ``sharpening.'' The Greens said 
Sunday they wanted to name four ministers, at least two of whom should 
be women. Social Democratic lawmaker Ulla Schmidt on Tuesday also 
called on Schroeder to appoint women to at least 40 percent of the 
top jobs in his government.
