The former Communists have dropped their refusal to cooperate with 
an ethnic Hungarian party in a future government, improving the chances 
for a multiparty coalition Cabinet to rule Slovakia for the next four 
years. The Democratic Left last Friday suddenly announced they wound 
not enter into a coalition with the Hungarians following last month's 
parliamentary elections in which the combined opposition won a sufficient 
majority to form a government and change the constitution. Reacting 
to the move, Bela Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian Coalition Party, 
which represents Slovakia's 550,000 ethnic Hungarians, threatened 
to be a strong opposition to the other three parties if left out of 
the coalition. Without the Hungarians, the opposition coalition would 
hold only 78 seats in the 150-seat Slovak Parliament, far short of 
the 90 votes needed to make changes to the constitution. But that 
was the main objective of all opposition parties in the campaign leading 
up ot the elections. After the vote, Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar 
said he would step down later this month, worsening even further prospects 
for his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia to form a government. The 
Democratic Left's reluctance to cooperate with the Hungarians was 
prompted by fears that the latter might seek regional autonomy and 
construction of a controversial hydropower project as well as challenge 
the validity of the so-called Benes decrees. Under the decrees bearing 
the name of former President Eduard Benes, up to 60,000 Hungarians 
_ alongside millions of ethnic Germans _ were deported from the territory 
of Czechoslovakia after 1945 as enemies of the Czech and Slovak people 
and their property was confiscated by the state. The chairman of the 
Hungarian party, Bela Bugar said on Monday that ``the Party of the 
Democratic Left changed its mind, probably because they want to improve 
their position in the government.'' Bugar said his party did not bring 
up the Benes'decrees at the negotiations. ``We want to form a government 
for four years, and as soon as we can. We do not want to go back to 
these questions when we are in the government,'' said Jozef Migas, 
chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left on Tuesday. The negotiations 
of the four opposition parties will continue on Thursday when they 
are to discuss a coalition agreement.
