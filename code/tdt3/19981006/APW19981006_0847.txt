A strike by 335 pilots grounded all aircraft operated by the Norwegian 
airline Braathens ASA on Tuesday, less than two days before the carrier 
has to move to Norway's new international airport. The pilots walked 
out after state mediation failed to settle new terms for their employment 
at Gardermoen, an airport that opens north of Oslo on Thursday to 
replace the country's current main airport, Fornebu. Gardermoen is 
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Oslo, while Fornebu is just 
a few kilometers (miles) from the center of the capital city. The 
pilots demanded that extra travel time to the new airport be counted 
as work time, which the airline refused, Braathens said in a statement. 
The strike stops about 200 flights a day, mainly on Norwegian domestic 
routes. It was not clear how long the conflict might last. According 
to Norway's NRK radio network, Braathens managed to direct all off 
its aircraft away from Fornebu Airport before the strike began. Norway's 
Civil Aviation Administration said any aircraft still at the old Fornebu 
airport after it closes permanently on Wednesday evening would not 
be allowed to take off, and would have to be disassembled for transport.
