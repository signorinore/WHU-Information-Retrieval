The Security Council held preliminary discussions Tuesday on the U.N. 
chief's Kosovo report, which stated that Serb forces intensified their 
attacks on ethnic Albanians even after the council demanded a cease-fire. 
No immediate action was expected from the 15-member council, which 
is divided as to whether to use force to end the Serb attacks on Kosovo 
and whether NATO needs any more council authority to initiate such 
force. Russia, a veto-holding council member, said Tuesday it was 
likely to veto any resolution specifically authorizing the use of 
force, and China _ which also holds a veto _ said it also opposed 
military intervention. ``Use of force won't help normalize the situation. 
It'll do just the opposite,'' Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov 
told the Interfax news agency. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Tang Guoqiang urged the international community to settle the dispute 
``through political dialogue.'' The council isn't required to take 
any action on the report. In its Sept. 23 resolution, the council 
demanded an immediate end to the fighting that has left hundreds of 
people _ mostly ethnic Albanian civilians _ dead and uprooted tens 
of thousands since a Serb crackdown began in February. Most ethnic 
Albanians want independence for the province, which is 90 percent 
Albanian. In its resolution, the council demanded that Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic withdraw his special forces from the province and 
allow for the safe return of refugees and for humanitarian access 
to them. It demanded both sides work toward finding a political solution 
and threatened unspecified action if both sides failed to comply with 
the entire resolution. In Monday's report, Annan reported that in 
the week following the resolution, government security forces ``intensified 
their operations, launching another offensive in the Drenica region,'' 
and elsewhere. Fighting continued Sept. 28-29 despite the Serb prime 
minister's statement that Serb operations had ended and peace reigned 
in Kosovo, Annan said. As a result, another 20,000 people were reportedly 
displaced, he said. Annan said he couldn't specifically determine 
Serb compliance with U.N. resolutions because the United Nations doesn't 
have the presence in Kosovo to confirm reports of atrocities. His 
report, however, listed several apparent violations of the Sept. 23 
resolution. While fighting began to wind down in the last days of 
September, with troops returning to their barracks and a limited number 
of police units being withdrawn, the United Nations has received information 
``that the government's armed presence remains significant and that 
the operations of the special police continue,'' Annan wrote. In his 
report, Annan decried the ``appalling atrocities in Kosovo'' and said 
it was ``clear beyond any reasonable doubt'' that Yugoslav forces 
were responsible for the bulk of them. He added there was reason to 
believe that the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, which has been fighting 
the Serbs, was responsible for atrocities as well. Annan said he was 
outraged by recent reports of mass killings of civilians in Kosovo 
_ reports that galvanized international threats to intervene with 
military force.
