A U.S. lawyer acting in behalf of Holocaust survivors has filed a 
class-action lawsuit against an Austrian bank in addition to two major 
German banks, the Austria Press Agency reported Tuesday. The lawyer, 
Edward Fagan, accuses Creditanstalt of Vienna of having conspired 
with Nazi authorities during World War II and having profited from 
the sale of gold robbed from Jewish victims of the Holocaust, APA 
reported. But Gerhard Reidlinger, the Creditanstalt spokesman, said 
talks would continue on compensation between Fagan and the bank's 
New York lawyers, the report said. On Monday, Fagan told APA that 
the lawsuit would provide the basis to move forward toward an agreement 
with the banks involved. Creditanstalt lawyer Charles Moerdler underlined 
the Austrian bank's resolve to live up to its moral responsibility. 
Fagan said earlier that two other Austrian banks could soon be faced 
with similar claims from Holocaust victims. He refused to name them. 
Austrian insurance companies will also be targets of class action 
suits from Holocaust victims, despite their arguments that they could 
not be taken to court in the United States, Fagan said. Creditanstalt 
was taken over by Germany's Deutsche Bank during the Nazi era. Fagan 
has been seeking compensation for gold stolen by the Nazis from Jewish 
families and allegedly transferred by Creditanstalt to Turkey during 
World War II. The Austrian news magazine Profil claimed last month 
that Creditanstalt maintained ``business contacts'' with at least 
13 concentration camps, including Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Mauthausen 
and Dachau. Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938, one year 
before the war began in Europe.
