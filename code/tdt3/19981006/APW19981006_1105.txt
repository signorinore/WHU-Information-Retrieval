Shuttling between Ankara and Damascus, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 
tried Tuesday to avert a feared war between Turkey and Syria over 
Kurdish rebels. In three hours of closed-door talks with Mubarak, 
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel upheld his nation's case that Syria 
is sheltering Turkish Kurd rebels responsible for cross-border attacks. 
Turkey is threatening force against Syria, which denies harboring 
the rebels. ``The Turkish side has explained the support extended 
by Syria to the terrorist activities in detail and said that this 
cannot go on. It has been stated that the Turkish public is outraged 
and pointed out to solid steps that have to be taken by Syria,'' Demirel 
said in a statement after the talks. Independent television NTV said 
Mubarak left Ankara with six Turkish demands for Syria: Cease support 
to the rebels, expel rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, close rebel camps 
in Syrian-controlled Lebanon, stop rebel trips across the border, 
recognize Turkey's existing borders and promise to establish good, 
neighborly relations. The statement from Demirel's office said the 
Egyptians were given a dossier _ apparently, one containing intelligence 
reports that Turkey believes confirm Syrian backing for the rebels. 
``We are warning Syria for the last time to cease its support to the 
separatist organization and abandon its hostile policy against Turkey,'' 
Premier Mesut Yilmaz told Parliament on Tuesday. Mubarak flew from 
the Turkish capital to Damascus late Tuesday and met for more than 
an hour with Syrian President Hafez Assad. It was their second meeting 
in three days. Assad's spokesman, Jubran Kourieh, did not give details, 
saying only that Mubarak outlined Ankara's views and listened to Syria's. 
Reports in Egypt said Mubarak was trying to work out a mechanism for 
the two sides to resolve the dispute peacefully. Mubarak told Egyptian 
journalists on his plane that he proposed that Turkey and Syria ``meet 
to discuss the details of the problem'' over the Kurdish rebels, Egypt's 
Middle East News Agency reported. Mubarak acknowledged Demirel's concern 
about the rebels, but added: ``I pointed out to him that our region 
does not accept or endure any military action or armed confrontation.'' 
MENA also said Mubarak was trying to arrange a meeting between the 
Turkish and Syrian foreign ministers as well as creation of a ``joint 
committee to start meeting to rebuild the bridges of confidence'' 
between the neighboring countries. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi weighed 
in on Syria's side Tuesday, saying ``any aggression against Syria 
will be considered as an aggression against Libya according to the 
Arab joint defense pact.'' Turkey stressed in a presidential statement 
Tuesday that the issue was not linked to Turkish-Arab relations. The 
United States and Russia, along with most countries of the Middle 
East, urged the two countries to reach a peaceful solution. Relations 
between Turkey and Syria have long been troublesome. Damascus is uneasy 
with Ankara's plans to build dams on the Euphrates River, a key source 
of water for Syria, while Turkey accuses Damascus of having designs 
on a Turkish border province, Hatay, which has a sizable Arab population. 
Syria also feels threatened by the military and diplomatic ties between 
Turkey and Israel. But the recent rise in tension appears part of 
Ankara's push to end fighting in a 14-year-old Kurdish insurgency 
in which 37,000 people have died. The rebels are fighting for Kurdish 
autonomy in southeast Turkey. Turkey has reportedly sent 10,000 troops 
to its border with Syria. Newspapers have suggested that its forces 
could stage raids on rebel camps in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley 
in Lebanon. There have been unconfirmed reports of Turkish jets buzzing 
the border area in a show of force.
