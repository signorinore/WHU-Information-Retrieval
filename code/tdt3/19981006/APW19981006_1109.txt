Fourth-seed Andre Agassi gave rising Swiss star Roger Federer a tennis 
lesson Tuesday, brushing aside the 1998 Wimbledon junior champion 
in the first round of the dlrs 1 million Swiss Indoors. Australian 
Open champion Petr Korda was less successful, becoming the only seeded 
casualty of the opening day, succumbing 6-2, 6-4 to Germany's Nicolas 
Kiefer. Agassi, who won each of his four titles this year without 
dropping a set, needed just 55 minutes to dispose of the U.S. Open 
junior finalist, breaking Federer's opening serve in each set on way 
to a 6-3, 6-2 win. Playing in only his third career ATP Tour event, 
Federer took advantage of a slight waver in Agassi's concentration 
to immediately break back and even the score to 1-1 in the second 
set. Agassi, however, quickly regained control to break the 17-year-old 
wildcard twice more to seal his victory. ``I took control of the match, 
and stayed in control,'' said Agassi, winner in Munich last weekend. 
``I got a little careless and he broke back but then I got it together 
again. ``It was nice to get that first match in to get used to the 
court. From here I intend to step it up as the tournament goes on.'' 
Agassi's last appearance in Basel dates back 10 years when he was 
17-years-old himself and on his way up. The American said he was impressed 
by Federer, who last week reached the quarterfinals in Toulouse, only 
his second career ATP Tour tournament. ``He seems younger than I felt 
back then,'' joked Agassi, who also won titles in Washington, Los 
Angeles and Key Biscayne this season. ``But I was very impressed by 
him. He's very talented. ``He missed some shots my opponents normally 
wouldn't miss, but I attribute that to being 17.'' A good result at 
the tournament could cement Agassi's place among the top-eight in 
the ATP standings, and secure the American a berth in the ATP Tour 
World Championship in Hannover next month. Korda, ninth in the ATP 
rankings, was was hoping a good performance in Basel might springboard 
him into the top-eight, past Britain's Tim Henman, to qualify for 
a spot in Hannover. Instead Korda spent just 77 minutes on the St. 
Jakobshalle court. The third-seed Czech left the stadium immediately 
following his defeat, refusing to talk to journalists. ``It's very 
satisfying to win against the world number five,'' said Kiefer. ``I 
served well and was very aggressive. It's likely due to my last three 
weeks of training, which were very intense.'' Kiefer will play the 
second round against lucky-loser Jeff Tarango of the United States, 
who beat France's Nicolas Escude 6-3, 6-3. In other first round play, 
fifth-seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia defeated Sweden's Magnus Norman 
7-5, 6-3. Currently eighth in the ATP rankings, sixth-seed Henman 
recorded a 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 comeback win over Australian Jason Stoltneberg, 
conserving his chances for a berth in Hannover. Home-crowd favorite 
Marc Rosset, 57th in the world, defeated Germany's Tommy Haas, ranked 
39th, 7-6 (7-3), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4). In further first-round action Wednesday, 
World No. 1 Pete Sampras plays 1994 champion Wayne Ferreira, and two-time 
U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter takes on Czech Daniel Vacek.
