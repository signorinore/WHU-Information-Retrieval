Andreas Brehme, whose penalty goal against Argentina five minutes 
from time gave Germany the 1990 World Cup title, celebrated his retirement 
Tuesday in a star-studded game. The match before 36,825 fans involved 
his last club FC Kaiserslautern, the reigning German champion, and 
an international All-Star selection. Among others, the selection included 
Ivan Zamorano, Christian Karembeu, Guiseppe Bergomi, Franco Baresi, 
Juergen Klinsmann, Pierre Littbarski, Nicola Berti, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, 
Rudi Voeller, Toni Schumacher, Thomas Haessler and Brehme himself. 
The All-Star selection had Franz Beckenbauer as coach, and clinched 
a 4-4 draw on two goals by Voeller and one each from Rummenigge and 
Toni Polster. Brehme played 86 games for Germany and was one of the 
country's best defenders in the 1980s and early 1990s. He retired 
after the 1994 World Cup, following Germany's ouster in the quarterfinals. 
But he stayed in club soccer, returning to his original Bundesliga 
club, Kaiserslautern. Brehme had tears as his eyes as Kaiserslautern 
dropped out of the Bundesliga for the first time in its history. But 
Brehme was also part of Kaiserslautern's historic achievement. The 
club gained immediate promotion and clinched the Bundesliga title 
in its comeback season, something never done by another Bundesliga 
club. While Kaiserslautern was winning the title, Brehme was gradually 
being phased out of the team by coach Otto Rehhagel and retired at 
the end of the season. He also played for Bayern Munich, Inter Milan 
and Real Zaragoza, and later said his years in Italy were the most 
important for his career. By a strange coincidence, Brehme's first 
international _ in 1984 _ was against the same team as his last official 
game, the 2-1 quarterfinal loss to Bulgaria at the 1994 World Cup 
in the United States. Brehme will be remembered in Germany for his 
cool poise when he took the penalty kick against Argentina at Rome's 
Olympic stadium in the 1990 World Cup final, driving a low shot inside 
the right post when no other German dared to take the shot.
