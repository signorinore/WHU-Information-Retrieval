In an Oct. 4 story on the death of Frank Pogson Doria Pamphili, The 
Associated Press failed to identify him by his full name. He was born 
Frank Pogson, but upon marriage his surname was joined with that of 
his wife's family, Doria Pamphili. The story also failed to reflect 
the change in the Doria Pamphili family name, to Pogson Doria Pamphili. 
The family name was changed at the express wish of the late Prince 
Doria.
