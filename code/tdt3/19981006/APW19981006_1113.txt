Shuttling between the Turkish and Syrian capitals, Egyptian President 
Hosni Mubarak tried Tuesday to avert a feared war between the two 
countries over Kurdish rebels. In three hours of closed-door talks 
with Mubarak, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel upheld his nation's 
case that Syria is sheltering Turkish Kurd rebels responsible for 
cross-border attacks. Turkey is threatening force against Syria, which 
denies harboring the rebels. ``The Turkish side has explained the 
support extended by Syria to the terrorist activities in detail and 
said that this cannot go on. It has been stated that the Turkish public 
is outraged and pointed out to solid steps that have to be taken by 
Syria,'' Demirel said in a statement after the talks. Independent 
television NTV said Mubarak left Ankara with six Turkish demands for 
Syria: Cease support to the rebels, expel rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, 
close rebel camps in Syrian-controlled Lebanon, stop rebel trips across 
the border, recognize Turkey's existing borders and promise to establish 
good, neighborly relations. The statement from Demirel's office said 
the Egyptians were given a dossier _ apparently, one containing intelligence 
reports that Turkey believes confirm Syrian backing for the rebels. 
``We are warning Syria for the last time to cease its support to the 
separatist organization and abandon its hostile policy against Turkey,'' 
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz told Parliament on Tuesday. Mubarak flew 
from the Turkish capital to Damascus late Tuesday and went directly 
into talks with Syrian President Hafez Assad. Neither leader talked 
with reporters before the meeting, their second in three days on the 
crisis. Mubarak told Egyptian journalists on his plane that he has 
proposed that Turkey and Syria ``meet to discuss the details of the 
problem'' over the Kurdish rebels, Egypt's Middle East News Agency 
reported. Mubarak acknowledged Demirel's concern about the rebels, 
but added: ``I pointed out to him that our region does not accept 
or endure any military action or armed confrontation.'' MENA also 
said Mubarak was trying to arrange a meeting between the Turkish and 
Syrian foreign ministers as well as creation of a ``joint committee 
to start meeting to rebuild the bridges of confidence'' between the 
neighboring countries. Turkey initially, 8th graf pvs
