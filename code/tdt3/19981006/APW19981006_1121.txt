A British tourist was killed Tuesday in a collision between two jet 
skis off the coast of this popular Mediterranean resort town. A police 
statement said Karen White, 32, was riding behind her husband, Greg, 
on a jet ski when the craft collided with another jet ski driven by 
a Dutch tourist. The statement said an investigation was under way 
into the accident. Britain's Press Association said the Whites were 
from Bitterne in southeast England. It said neither of the drivers 
was injured. Ayia Napa, on the east coast of Cyprus, draws thousands 
of foreign tourists every year.
