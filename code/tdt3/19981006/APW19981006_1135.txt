Israel and the Palestinians have failed to make the ``tough choices'' 
needed to conclude a West Bank accord and unless they do, Mideast 
peacemaking could fall apart, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
said Tuesday. Her remarks, as she met with Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu here and with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 
in Jericho on the West Bank, seemed designed to spur the leaders to 
tackle their differences. The key challenge appeared to be settling 
on security arrangements that would enable Netanyahu to sign off on 
a 13 percent pullback from the West Bank with high hopes of getting 
the deal through his rightist Likud coalition government. Still, Albright 
set up a three-way meeting on Wednesday with Arafat and Netanyahu 
at Erez, on the border between Israel and Palestinian-held Gaza. ``Time 
is not on our side,'' Albright said, standing alongside Arafat in 
his Jericho headquarters. ``If we don't move quickly, we may find 
ourselves without a process of peacemaking, without an agreement, 
and without the hope of achieving an Israeli-Palestinian peace.'' 
Arafat declined to be drawn out on the security issue. ``Peace means 
security, peace means freedom,'' he said. The territorial issue _ 
the terms of Israel's pullback _ was ``largely resolved,'' said U.S. 
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin. But dozens of other issues 
remain unresolved, he said. Whatever Albright may accomplish here, 
there will be no agreement before U.S. President Bill Clinton hosts 
a Washington summit with Arafat and Netanyahu, he added. ``I think 
we envisage the summit as a multi-day exercise where some heavy lifting 
is going to be required,'' he said. ``We do not envisage it as a photo-op 
in which everything is pre-cooked.'' The summit's exact date and site 
are in flux. The likely startup is Oct. 15 or Oct. 20, and the location 
could be outside Washington, such as at the Wye Plantation on Maryland's 
Eastern Shore. After Albright leaves the region, probably on Wednesday, 
U.S. mediator Dennis Ross and Assistant Secretary of State Martin 
Indyk will remain for further talks with Israeli and Palestinian officials. 
``We recognize there are tough choices that have to be made by both 
sides as we approach the Washington summit,'' said Albright, wearing 
matching peace-dove earrings, bracelet and pin, as she gave no indication 
that differences had been cleared up. The aim is an Israeli pullback 
on the West Bank, the acquisition of more territory for the Palestinians 
and the start of negotiations over such issues as the future of Jerusalem 
and Palestinian aspirations for a state. Whatever the outcome, Albright 
said the United States intends to pursue a better relationship with 
the Palestinian Authority ``for its own sake.'' ``We have thought 
for some time about increasing the level of discourse,'' she said. 
But she declined to say whether the administration was setting the 
stage for dealing ultimately with a Palestinian state. Earlier, in 
Jerusalem, there also was no report of progress in Albright's meeting 
with Netanyahu. A senior Israeli official, David Bar-Illan, said the 
Palestinian Authority had done ``nothing, nothing, nothing'' in the 
runup to the planned summit to rout terrorists on land under its control. 
Albright placed highest priority on security measures but said there 
were a number of issues where ``parallel'' movement by Israel and 
the Palestinians was needed. For his part, Netanyahu said Israel had 
met its obligations _ meaning a willingness to relinquish more land 
on the West Bank _ and ``the crucial question'' was whether the Palestinians 
would reciprocate. Bar-Illan complained specifically about anti-Israel 
provisions that remain in the Palestine Liberation Organization's 
covenant and the presence, he said, of 13 indicted terrorist suspects 
in the Palestinian police.
