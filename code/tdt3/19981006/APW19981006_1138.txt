Afghanistan's opium poppy crop is expected to drop by 25 percent this 
year, the U.N. drug control agency said. The decline is due mostly 
to bad weather rather than effective measures by the country's Taliban 
religious rulers. In a report, the Vienna-based U.N. Drug Control 
Program estimated Afghanistan's 1998 production would reach about 
2,100 metric tons down from the 1997 yield of 2,800 metric tons. U.N. 
officials had expected this year's crop to surpass last year's. Opium 
poppies are used to manufacture heroin, and U.N. officials said the 
decline means 70 tons (63.5 metric tons) of illicit heroin will be 
off the world markets. ``An unusually long 1998 winter season, heavy 
and continuous rains and hail storms in southern Afghanistan and unseasonal 
rains in northern Afghanistan are all factors which adversely affected 
the opium yield,'' the report said. Despite the projected decline, 
the U.N. agency said opium poppy cultivation spread for the first 
time to two new Afghan provinces _ Loghar and Laghman _ as well as 
several new districts. That raised concerns that _ barring an effective 
government crackdown _ next year's crop could increase significantly 
if the weather improves. ``I appeal to all parties in Afghanistan 
to exert their best efforts in order to dissuade the farmers from 
planting opium poppy in the coming growing season, especially in new 
areas,'' the head of the drug control agency, Pino Arlacchi, said. 
Arlacchi warned that if his appeal goes unheeded, he will ask U.N. 
member states to tighten controls on Afghanistan's land borders. The 
United Nations estimates that heroin of Afghan origin accounts for 
80 percent of the European market and 20 percent of the American.
