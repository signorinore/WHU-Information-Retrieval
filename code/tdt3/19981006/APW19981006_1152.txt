OTTAWA, Canada (AP) -- The Canadian government is advising Canadians 
to leave Yugoslavia while there are still commercial flights available, 
``unless their presence is essential.'' Foreign Affairs spokeswoman 
Sophi Legendre said all non-essential diplomatic staff and the families 
of all diplomatic staff are being evacuated from Belgrade this week. 
She said the government made the move because ``we're anticipating 
potential problems because of the current situation.'' She was referring 
to NATO threats to launch airstrikes unless Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic accepts international demands to halt the crackdown against 
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo province.
