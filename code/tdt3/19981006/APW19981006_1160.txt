Trying to prevent attacks by Islamic militants, police reinforcements 
patrolled Jerusalem and sealed off downtown streets Tuesday as thousands 
of Jews prayed at the Western Wall to mark the Sukkot holiday. The 
security measures came as U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
arrived for talks with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders on a West 
Bank troop pullback. In the West Bank, two dozen Palestinians clashed 
with Israeli soldiers at the entrance to the tense, divided city of 
Hebron. Palestinian teenagers threw rocks and bottles at Israeli soldiers 
at a roadblock. Israeli forces fired tear gas and rubber-coated steel 
bullets at the demonstrators. No injuries were reported. Palestinian 
police intervened to restore order. A Palestinian policeman approached 
an Israeli soldier and threatened, ``if you shoot one more rubber 
bullet, I will shoot you.'' After the arrival of the Palestinian police 
commander in Hebron, the Israelis opened the roadblock and allowed 
Palestinians to enter and leave the city. A leaflet distributed in 
the Hebron and signed by Fatah, the Palestinian movement aligned with 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, called for a general strike Thursday 
and more clashes Friday to protest a closure and curfew on the city. 
``this leaflets shows the disappointment and despair of the people 
of Hebron and the daily harassment from the Israeli army against our 
people,'' said Jamal Shobaki, a Fatah leader. ``Albright talks about 
peace, but we have collective punishment, closures, curfews ... all 
this is not in accordance with the peace that Albright is talking 
about,'' he said. Hebron has been sealed off for a week, since grenades 
were thrown at Israeli soldiers guarding Jewish settlers in the middle 
of the city. Palestinians in the Israeli-controlled part of downtown 
Hebron are still confined to their homes by an Israeli curfew order. 
In traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, police sealed off streets outside 
the Old City. Officers were stationed every few meters (yards). Police 
banned vehicles from entering the Old City, except for public transport 
and cars of residents. Israel police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said 
the measures around Jerusalem were meant to control traffic because 
of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, when Jews throng to the Old City 
to pray at the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site. She said police 
remain on high alert because of general warnings of attacks by Islamic 
militants. Israeli media broadcast warnings from unnamed security 
sources about terror attacks being plotted by the militants, including 
plans to kidnap Israeli politicians. Hamas political leader Mahmoud 
Zahar refused to comment on the reports. But he told the Associated 
Press that Hamas favors retaliation against ``military or any other 
targets'' to stop Israel from killing Palestinians. ``The Israelis 
do not understand any language except violence,'' he said. Israeli 
media have been warning people here of impending terror attacks for 
three weeks, since Israeli forces shot and killed two Hamas leaders 
in the West Bank. The warnings drew fire from a columnist in the Israeli 
daily Haaretz daily. Yoel Marcus charged that Israeli security services 
were ``whistling in the dark.'' While admitting that there is reason 
for concern, Marcus wrote, ``it would be better to concentrate on 
scaring Hamas, not the Israeli public.''
