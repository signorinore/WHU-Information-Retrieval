"Headline News," I'm David Goodnow. Those stories in a moment but 
first -- President Clinton is urging countries to look beyond the 
immediate threat of an economic crisis. Speaking to world financial 
leaders, he urged nations to find solutions. John king reports. The 
president is pushing a way to end the global economic crisis. He wants 
the world bank to rewrite their rules and a new proposal is a IMF 
line of credit. We if you be prepared that they are ready for the 
new challenges of our time. Especially after another roller coaster 
time on wall sheet. He says this proves it's time for Congress to 
pass legislation for this bailout. The world is wait lg for Congress 
to step up to America's responsibility, provide funds to the IMF and 
give us the tools we need to pull teethers economies from the brink, 
to keep America's prosperity going. It's clear the president's advice 
would carry more weight overseas if the United States put up the money. 
The ideas and resources and then I think U.S. leadership with MiG 
a lot of sense fwh this. The financial crisis that began 15 months 
ago spread from Thailand to Indonesia and on to south Korea. Now, 
Japan is in recession, Russia on the verge of economic collapse and 
trouble in Brazil is raising fears across Latin America. The risk 
is growing that the effects will be larger than we thought. Therefore 
it's in the U.S. self interest to work with the IMF to try to turn 
around the situation in these countries. The IMF money has been held 
up by conservative opposition in Congress. But for all the finger 
pointing over the budget in recent days, republican sources predict 
a compromise will be worked out soon, perhaps as early as this week.
