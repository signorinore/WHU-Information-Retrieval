The clerk will call the role. Mr. McCollum votes aye. After hours 
of debate, the house Judiciary committee Monday recommended launching 
an open-ended impeachment inquiry against President Clinton. The vote 
on the republican-sponsored resolution was split along party lines 
21 republicans voted in favor and 16 democrats voted in opposition. 
Democrats also failed in two attempts to limit the length and scope 
of the investigation of Mr. Clinton's conduct. The resolution must 
be approved by the full house. It could begin debating it Thursday 
or Friday.
