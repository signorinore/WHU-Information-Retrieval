In an hour-long presentation, the GOP's lead investigator broadened 
the 11 counts recommended by independent counsel Ken Starr. David 
schippers concluded there is evidence Mr. Clinton may have engaged 
in a conspiracy to obstruct justice with false testimony by withholding 
evidence and by tampering with witnesses. Schippers concluded his 
remarks with personal comments that angered some democrats. Members 
of the committee, you're not being watched only by the individuals 
in this room, or even by the immense television audience throughout 
the world. Fifteen generations of Americans, our fellow Americans, 
many of whom are reposing in military cemeteries throughout the world 
are looking down on you and judging what you do today. After democrats 
protested and Henry Hyde said he sympathized and ordered them stricken 
from the record. The chief democratic investigator then launched a 
rebuttal of the republican case for impeachment. The process thus 
far is backwards. The committee is considering whether to open what 
type of actual impeachment inquiry without having spent a single minute 
discussing what conduct of a president rises to an impeachable offense. 
This, members of the committee, is the equivalent of a ship's captain 
leaving on a difficult and uncharted voyage, hoping to find his or 
her compass somewhere along the way.
