As the White House prepares for a possible impeachment inquiry three 
of President Clinton's top advisers are leaving within three weeks 
of each other. Chief of staff Erskine Bowles says he will leave soon 
after Congress completes its work possibly as soon as this week. The 
president's senior adviser Rahm Emanuel is leaving October 19th. And 
press secretary Mike McCurry's last day was Friday. The White House 
maintains the departures are not related to the investigation of the 
president.
