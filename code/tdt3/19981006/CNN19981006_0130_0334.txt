President Clinton is warning that time is running short to avoid a 
federal government shutdown. He is urging Congress to pass several 
spending bills before the end of the week. The new fiscal year began 
on Thursday, and nine of 13 spending measures still are unresolved. 
Mr. Clinton has signed a law that keeps government agencies running 
through Friday. House speaker Newt Gingrich says he is cautiously 
optimistic lawmakers will complete their work by Saturday.
