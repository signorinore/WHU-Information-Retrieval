People are cleaning up in Missouri after a storm dumped six inches 
of rain on the Kansas city area. At least seven people were killed 
including a new father who called his wife from a cellular phone as 
he stood on top of his flood-stranded car. His sister says his last 
words were "I'm going to have to jump or I don't know what I'll do." 
Hours later, recovery teams found his body nearby. The storm system 
spawned tornadoes in central Oklahoma. The twisters demolished homes 
and businesses in Prague and Shawnee. At least 18 people were injured. 
A complete look at the weather is coming up in the extended forecast 
at 38 past the hour.
