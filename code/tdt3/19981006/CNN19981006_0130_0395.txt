The Supreme Court opened its new term Monday with several rulings. 
In two notable decisions the court upheld a New York City zoning law 
used to prohibit topless dancing. The justices rejected claims the 
1995 ordinance discriminated against female dancers and stifled erotic 
expression. And they said an Indiana school district may continue 
random drug testing of students who take part in extracurricular activities. 
Several parents challenged the tests saying they were an invasion 
of privacy.
