In Kentucky, 15-year-old Michael Carneal has pleaded guilty, but mentally 
ill, to last December's shootings at a west Paducah school. Three 
Heath high school students were killed in the attack and five were 
wounded. Under the agreement, the teen faces life in prison with the 
possibility of parole after 25 years. The sentence is the maximum 
allowed in Kentucky for defendants under the age of 16. Michael Carneal 
understands his feelings, his attitude, his beliefs at the time of 
the shooting were, in fact, wrong. He deeply regrets the overwhelming 
pain, the injuries and the loss of life that his acts have caused. 
He's admitted full responsibility for his acts and he accepts the 
maximum penalty that the law will allow. Carneal's sentencing is set 
for December 16th.
