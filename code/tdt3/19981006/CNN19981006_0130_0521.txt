With a look at your "Headline News weather," I'm Karen McGinnis. A 
frontal system makes very little progress over the next several days. 
It extends from the Great Lakes all the way down into Texas. Behind 
the front it is cooler and drier, but along the frontal system, we 
could expect potentially heavy amounts of rainfall. Look for stormy 
skies in Minneapolis, Chicago, St. Louis, Little Rock and even into 
Dallas, Texas. Temperature wise 60s plunge all the way into Texas. 
Warmer readings into the southeast and the desert southwest. Look 
for 32 degrees in Fairbanks Alaska, but breezy conditions across the 
Hawaiian islands. Extended forecast is calling for showers and storms 
across the southeast. Then by Thursday, a pickup in the moisture for 
the pacific northwest and still 90s in the desert southwest. Going 
into Friday, that rain pushes into the Great Lakes region as well 
as into the northeast with more showers expected for the pacific northwest.
