Secretary of state Madeleine Albright is heading to the Middle East 
for meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders. She's expected 
to talk separately Tuesday with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
and Palestinian authority President Yasser Arafat. They are expected 
to finalize an agreement over Israeli troop withdrawal from the West

Clinton this month.
