Meanwhile, Albright says some troop deployment is being considered 
for the situation in SOS VO. U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke has met 
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in an attempt to end the 
conflict in Kosovo. The U.N. security council has demanded a cease-fire. 
Brent Sadler has more. They sized each other up. No strangers to crises 
in the Balkans, U.S envoy Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic met face to face in Belgrade. Holbrooke delivering 
what may be a last warning to the Yugoslav leader. Abide by all United 
Nations demands over Kosovo or expect to face the consequences of 
NATO air strikes. We never discuss whether we make progress or not. 
We just -- we just keep going and do the best we can. This is a dangerous 
moment in the region. We've been at these dangerous moments before. 
This one is particularly difficult. The Holbrooke mission coincides 
with a damning report to the United Nations security council that 
most of the recent atrocities in Kosovo were committed by Yugoslav 
forces under Milosevic's control. There are also alleged instances 
of ethnic Albanian fighters killing Serb civilians, but to a much 
Lesser extent. Yugoslav compliance with U.N. demands to withdraw forces 
and halt repression in Kosovo appears sketchy. The U.N. also said 
it cannot verify whether Yugoslav army and police units are returning 
to their barracks. Serbian state television, meanwhile, is broadcasting 
militaristic programming. Applauding the performance of Yugoslavia's 
armed forces, both past and present. Alluding to military readiness 
to defend the nation against possible attack. On the ground in Kosovo, 
there's little or no change in the deteriorating conditions for Kosovo's 
Albanian refugees. President Milosevic claims he's done enough to 
comply with the U.N. and avert NATO intervention. He was shown on 
state television relaxing with a gathering of children from Serb-friendly 
nations. "I want you to grow up in peace," he tells them. "To live 
in peace and grow old in peace." President Milosevic reportedly told 
the U.S. delegation that air strikes against Yugoslavia would be a 
criminal act and he urged the west to try to revive peace talks instead 
of making threats. Brent Sadler, CNN, Belgrade.
