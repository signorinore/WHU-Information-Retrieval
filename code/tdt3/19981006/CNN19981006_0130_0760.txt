Top stories are just ahead on "Headline News." And coming up -- a 
bumper crop, but bitterness. Boundaries. From the very beginning... 
we have resented them. So what happens? Some of us grow up to be business 
people and what do we face? More boundaries! The telecommunications 
boundaries that separate local from long distance, voice from data, 
domestic from global. And force you to accept separate carriers, separate 
networks, a blizzard of bills. Ah, but these is a way through those 
barriers. Right through... here. The port of entry to a seamless global 
network that lets you have one carrier, one contact, one Bill. And 
makes it seem as though the old boundaries no longer exist. Because 
for you, they won't. On-net. From MCI Worldcom. For Dodge intrepid 
we looked beyond a great look... and took cab-forward architecture 
to a new place. With a spacious cabin, a very useful pass-through, 
and a cavernous trunk, intrepid is an automobile for today. Wrapped 
in a shape for the next millennium.
