American apple growers are furious over juice made from imported concentrate. 
Ed Garsten tells us, the juice may cost less. But it may also be enough 
to drown apple growers in debt. The rich, deep-red fruit that appears 
each fall on Bill Austin's apple trees is sold for the green, hard 
cash that provides Austin with his livelihood. But Austin and thousands 
of other U.S. apple growers are facing hard times. I haven't seen 
economic conditions like this in the 32 years that I've been in business. 
That's because the price producers pay apple growers is in a free 
fall as producers increasingly buy cheaper imported concentrate. According 
to the U.S. apple growers association, known as "usapple," China, 
Hungary and other nations are selling concentrate below the cost to 
produce it -- a practice called "dumping." As a result, usapple says 
imports of Chinese concentrate are up almost 1,000% in the last three 
years, while its prices has dropped by more than half. And imports 
of Hungarian concentrate jumped 254% during the same period, while 
its price dropped some 53%. Monday, usapple threatened possible legal 
action against countries it believes are guilty of dumping concentrate. 
Besides its own legal action, usapple could ask President Clinton 
to go before the international trade commission and request a formal 
investigation. If it finds that substantial harm has been done to 
U.S. growers, it could impose quotas or tariffs on imported concentrate. 
The growers, meanwhile, are demanding juice producers note the nation 
of origin on labels if concentrate is used and are urging consumers 
to choose fresh-squeezed juice. All this could ultimately raise the 
price of apple juice. But the growers say controlling imports of cheap, 
imported concentrate is at the core of their survival. Ed Garsten,
