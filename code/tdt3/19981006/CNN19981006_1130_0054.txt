First -- CNN has learned, the attorney for Paula Jones has rejected 
the latest offer for an out-of-court settlement of her sexual harassment 
lawsuit against President Clinton. That offer was $700,000. Sources 
say the president's attorney, Robert Bennett, has asked Jones's attorney 
for a counter-offer. Jones had been seeking $1 million but that is 
now off the table. Jones, a former Arkansas state employee, claims 
then-governor Clinton exposed himself and asked her for sexual favors 
in 1991. Her lawsuit was thrown out of court by a federal judge this 
year. Jones's lawyers are appealing that decision.
