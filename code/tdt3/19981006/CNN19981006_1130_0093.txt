President Clinton is calling on the world's top financial leaders 
to take action to stop the spread of the economic crisis affecting 
Asia, Russia and parts of Latin America. He's urging the leaders of 
the international monetary fund and world bank to find ways to react 
faster when signs of trouble develop. Mr. Clinton says it is a political 
as well as an economic crisis. The financial crisis poses a Stern 
test of whether democracies are capable of producing the broad public 
support necessary for difficult policies that entail sacrifice today 
for tomorrow's growth. I believe strong democracy, fair and honest 
regulation, sound social policy, are not enemies of the market. I 
believe they are essential conditions for long-term success. Nations 
with freely ee lengted governments where the broad mass of people 
believe the government represents them and acts in their interests 
have been willing and able to act to Ward off crisis.
