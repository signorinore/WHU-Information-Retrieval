Treasury secretary Robert Rubin says the economic troubles in Asia 
are having a direct impact on the prosperity of America's farms, workers 
and businesses. According to a treasury department study, every state 
has seen declining exports. Kansas saw an 18% drop in agricultural 
exports to Asia in the first quarter of this year, compared to the 
same period last year. Minnesota experienced a 50% decline. New York 
state saw a 31% decline.
