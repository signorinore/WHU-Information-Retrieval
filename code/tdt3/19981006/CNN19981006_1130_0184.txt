The full House of Representatives will now decide whether to move 
forward with an impeachment investigation of President Clinton. A 
vote could come later this week. Yesterday, not a single democrat 
on the house Judiciary committee voted to recommend an investigation, 
but party unity could fade in the full house. Today, house democrats 
are meeting to discuss the upcoming vote. One continuing source of 
disagreement with republicans is how long an investigation might last. 
It is important that we not limit the investigation. We are looking 
at one situation right now, but we shouldn't arbitrarily say to to 
the independent counsel, that no matter what else you come up with, 
we are not going to consider it. So we do expect to hear from the 
independent counsel, sometime after the election, sometime in November. 
We didn't think the country needs another four-year blank check investigation 
of every aspect of the president's life. If Mr. Starr, after 4 1/2 
years, came up only with the Lewinsky matter, than let's investigate 
the Lewinsky matter and get it resolved before the end of the year. 
The White House says the committee's vote for an open-ended inquiry 
proves politics is behind the process.
