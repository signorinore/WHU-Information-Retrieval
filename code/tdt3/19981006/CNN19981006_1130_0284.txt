President Clinton says it's time to end the violence in Kosovo. He 
warned today, that NAto is prepared to take action against Yugoslavia 
if necessary. Defense secretary William Cohen says that action could 
involve U.S. forces, but he says he is against the idea of using American 
ground troops in Kosovo. I think the most immediate thing that you 
have talked about, frankly, in many of your public statements is the 
need to take action in Kosovo to prevent the humanitarian crisis that 
currently is taking place. So I think there's been a recognition on 
everyone's part, including yours, and other members of this committee 
and other members of the house. Action has to be taken to prevent 
50,000 people from freezing or starving to death, and we would like 
to take that action but limited to the air operation. NATO officials 
say they could be ready for a military attack within hours once the 
order is given.
