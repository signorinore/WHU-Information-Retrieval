Secretary of state Madeleine Albright says there is still much work 
to be done on a peace agreement before an Israeli/Palestinian summit 
in Washington later this month. She met with Israeli prime minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem this morning. Albright later met with 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. No progress was reported from the 
talks. I think we all know that time is not on our side, and if we 
do not move quickly, we can find ourself without a process of peace-making 
and without an agreement and without achieving an Israeli/Palestinian 
peace. Finally, let me say, I would be remised that today is the 25th 
anniversary of the yom Kippur war, and that conflict which claimed 
so many young lives is a reminder of that terrible cost of confrontation 
in this region and the imperative of pursuing peace.
