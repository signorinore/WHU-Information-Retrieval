Meanwhile, Iraqis are struggling under U.N.-imposed sanctions. Rula 
Amin reports. Every month each Iraqi receives -- kilos of flour, 2.5 
kilos of rice, 2 kilos of sugar, 150 grams of tea, 1 kilo of lard, 
2 bars soap, 350 grams of tide, 0.5 kilo of dried beans, 250 grams 
oflentil, another 0.25 kilo of chick peas, and 150 grams of salt. 
Only children under 12 months receive 6 tins of dry milk. It's called 
oil for food program, or 986, the U.N. resolution that allows Iraq 
to sell some of its oil to buy basic needs, and distribute them to 
the population. Iraq's foreign minister says Iraqis are being turned 
into refugees receiving food rations, paid for with Iraq's own oil 
money. The oil for food program has fallen far below its targets. 
One reason is a general drop in oil prices that had severely hit Iraq's 
oil revenues. Former U.N. coordinator in Iraq Dennis halliday acknowledges 
that the program is underfunded, slow and bureaucratic. Halliday left 
Baghdad a week ago saying he couldn't be accountable to two incompatible 
resolutions, one imposing sanctions, and the other trying to reduce 
the sufferings due to sanctions. There is a general collapse here 
in many aspects of Iraqi life. It seems to me we are going to find 
a new generation of Iraqi leadership. They haven't had the access 
to good reading material, they haven't traveled. They feel isolated 
and alienated from their neighbors and from the rest of the world. 
Halliday warns that in terms of the future and in terms of decision-making 
in Iraq, this could be a consequence that the rest of the world needs 
to worry about. Rula Amin, for CNN, Baghdad.
