I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "Headline News weather." Much 
cooler weather will be spreading in through parts of Texas and into 
Oklahoma today. Forecast temperatures only in the 60s, out in advance 
of the front, though still warm along the Florida gulf coast and back 
into Louisiana, some highs will be in the 80s, as 50s continue, too, 
through much of the upper midwest. Check of your forecast for later 
today on into Wednesday, most of the wet weather continues from the 
Great Lakes all the way back down to the gulf coast along a strong 
cold front, which could produce some severe thunderstorms along gulf 
coast regions today. Still, fair weather lingers in the northeast. 
New front in the pacific northwest will bring another chance for some 
showers. The extended forecast on Thursday, most of the east coast 
will be wet with rain and thunderstorms. Showers will affect the pacific 
northwest as temperatures will be coolest in the Great Lakes and warmest 
in the southwest. Same trend continues on Friday, rain continues in 
the northeast. We will find showers and windy conditions in the pacific 
northwest. And by Saturday, rain should begin to taper off in the 
east, but continue in the pacific northwest.
