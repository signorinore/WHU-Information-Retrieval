Hundreds of homes are being threatened this morning by wildfires east 
of Los Angeles. 30 mile per hour winds are fanning the flames near 
the town of banning. Hundreds of people who evacuated, have been allowed 
to return to their homes. The fires are blamed for two deaths. A firefighter 
collapsed while hosing down roofs, and the pilot of an air tanker 
is presumed dead. His plane crashed while he was battling the flames.
