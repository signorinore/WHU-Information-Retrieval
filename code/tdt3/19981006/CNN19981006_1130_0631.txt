Major headaches for commuters north of Boston today. A one-mile stretch 
of route 128 is closed in both directions, after a tanker truck, carrying 
10,000 gallons of natural gas, collided with a car. The truck's driver 
was killed. Workers have removed the truck from the road, but it isn't 
known when the heavily traveled route will reopen. Adding to the problem, 
a commuter rail station near the accident scene was closed.
