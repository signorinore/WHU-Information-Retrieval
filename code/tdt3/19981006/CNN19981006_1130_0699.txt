How do you really know if you need to lose weight? Sure, there are 
the obvious signs, but every body is unique. In general, your best 
weight is your lean body mass -- everything but fat -- plus just enough 
fat necessary for good health. The American medical association says 
that's 10% to 18% of total body weight for men, and 18% to 25% for 
women. The most accurate way to determine your percentage of body 
fat is to get weighed under water, or get a skin-fold measurement. 
Both are best performed by a health professional. How about a little 
step up? It is possible to be overweight without being over-fat, especially 
if you work out a lot, building muscle mass. Many doctors now believe 
it's okay to be slightly over your ideal weight. But if you hit 20% 
over the ideal, you put yourself at risk for serious health problems. 
To lose weight, a little exercise can go a long way, as can a well-balanced 
diet.
