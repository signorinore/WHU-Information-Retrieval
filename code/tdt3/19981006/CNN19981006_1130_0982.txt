Buyers outpacing Sellers on Wall Street. Let's get the latest numbers 
from Valerie Morris in the cnnfn newsroom in New York. Valerie? Thanks, 
Catherine. Investors are in a buying mood on Wall Street. Fueling 
their confidence -- strong rallies in financial markets in Europe 
and modest gains in Asia. Also, an earnings surprise from Motorola. 
The Dow was up 154 points earlier. Almost all the Dow 30 stocks are 
in positive territory. Wal-Mart is leading the pack, up more than 
2 1/4 at 59 9/16, this after reporting sales in September jumped 9.5%. 
the discount chain also plans to open 280 new stores next year. Investors 
are sending stock prices higher today, but one analyst says they're 
still a bargain. I think this argument about bull market, bear market 
is a bit misplaced. The average stock on the New York exchange and 
NASDAQ is down well more than 40% from its high. And a few of the 
generals have held up. The indees sees look relatively better.
