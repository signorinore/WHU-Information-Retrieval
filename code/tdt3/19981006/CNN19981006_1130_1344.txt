At prairie view, the band played on, so the team won't. The southwestern 
athletic conference has indefinitely suspended the entire prairie 
view A&M athletic program after the school allowed the band to play 
at Saturday's game. The swac slapped prairie view's band with a two-game 
suspension following a fight with southern's band. The ban immediately 
affects football, volleyball, track and bowling. The school will appeal 
the suspension.
