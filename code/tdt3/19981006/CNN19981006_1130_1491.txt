Kids may be clamoring for a new toy this holiday season. It's tiny 
and furry and speaks its own language. Jeanne Moos introduces us to 
furby. Meet a toy that thinks fingers are finger-lickin' good. yum. 
a toy that toys with you. Whoa, whoa, careful. a toy capable of creating 
kiddie chaos. Furby! Furby! Furby may not have much sense, but he's 
got a lot of sensors. Furby has seven sensors you can interact with. 
He has a front tickle sensor, right here in the front. There's a sensor 
in his mouth. Furby eats pretend food. Hungry! He sure won't starve 
in this crowd. Furby was forced fed finger food, but his favorite 
kind of chip is computer according to inventor Dave Hampton. The technology 
is about equivalent to the apple II. But at the F.A.O. schwarz launch, 
furby wasn't the only thing programmed. We're going to practice clapping. 
All right, as best and loud as you can be. We're going to practice 
again 'cause it was really good, but it wasn't really happy. When 
the moment came, the kids came through. And adults were snapping up 
furby. What is the appeal? What do you -- I don't know. I'm just getting 
them because everybody else is. About $35. $35. Why is it so expensive? 
From the mouths of babes -- what comes out of furby's mouth is a fantasy 
language called "furbish." Ghundi, ghundi. He even comes with a furbish/English 
dictionary and eventually learns English. Furby's also big on bodily 
functions. Gesundheit. Aw, shut up. You can zip him up, but you can't 
always shut him up. Put two furbies together, and they interact or 
act up. They're not gonna start having baby furbies right before our 
eyes? No, right now just dancing. That would be the next step, making 
one that would give birth. Which reminds us of the movie "gremlins." 
Notice the resemblance. When water was spilled on a gremlin -- Great, 
thanks a lot. Sorry. It reproduced. But when we tried water on furby, 
all he did was burp. In a test of furby's endurance, we stuck him 
in the freezer. Nor did he die from being blow-dried. We finally placed 
him on eighth avenue, where bicyclists and motorists tried to avoid 
him, Nevertheless. But furby kept twitching. He's harder to kill than 
a gremlin. ahh. Furby's just tickled -- -- not to be Roadkill. uh-oh.
