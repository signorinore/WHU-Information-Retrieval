President Clinton says NAto is prepared to act to end the violence 
in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. Today, defense secretary William 
Cohen warned NATO air strikes could destroy a substantial portion 
of Serbia's military power. NAto is demanding Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic comply with U.N. security council resolutions to end hostilities 
against ethnic Albanians. A U.N. agency says only about 50,000 refugees 
have returned home, and a heavy Serbian police presence is preventing 
thousands more from going back.
