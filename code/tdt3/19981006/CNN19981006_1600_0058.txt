Richard Holbrooke met with Milosevic for a second time today. Brent 
Sadler has more. Dusk in Pristina, and a convoy of Serb police withdraws 
from Kosovo. Proof, according to Yugoslav authorities, that Belgrade 
is complying with international demands to stand down its police and 
army forces. United States special envoy Richard Holbrooke continues 
to press for a diplomatic breakthrough, but has apparently made no 
headway. This is very tough. NATO is moving forward very rapidly in 
a sustained, intense and serious manner. Shuttling between Belgrade 
and Pristina, the Holbrooke effort is running on several tracks to 
end repression in the embattled Kosovo province, encourage a return 
home of refugees and pressure Serbs and ethnic Albanians to agree 
to a new peace deal. Ibrahim Rugova, leader of Kosovo's largest political 
party, is not ready to accept the plan. It envisages shelving calls 
for Kosovo independence for three years, in exchange for a degree 
of self-rule. The U.S. delegation heard discouraging reports from 
the field. Yugoslav army units may have pulled back, but Serb paramilitary 
police are present in large numbers, and that alone could trigger 
a NATO attack. There's virtually no chance ethnic Albanian refugees 
will risk going back to villages as long as heavily armed Serb police 
are in place. The discovery of more violent deaths intensifies widespread 
fear, as recognized by the U.S. envoy. The reason they are not going 
home is because they are scared to, and you and I would be scared, 
too, if the village where you lived contained special security forces 
who had recently shot up your home and perhaps killed some of the 
people. Right now, we are in a countdown towards a decisive moment 
in the history of the Balkans. President Milosevic insists he's done 
enough. A NATO attack, he says, would be criminal. Diplomacy may not 
yet have failed, but if it does, contingency plans have begun -- starting 
with an expected evacuation of nonessential U.S. embassy personnel 
and families from the Serbian capital by the end of the week. Brent 
Sadler, CNN, Belgrade.
