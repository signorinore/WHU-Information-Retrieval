President Clinton could soon be the third U.S. president to face an 
impeachment inquiry. The house Judiciary committee passed a resolution 
yesterday to move forward with an open-ended impeachment investigation. 
The committee's recommendation now goes before the full House of Representatives 
for a vote on Thursday or Friday. With a republican majority, it appears 
all but certain the house will approve it. In the next two or three 
weeks, and that's all we have before the election, you're going to 
have a lot of members of both parties who are going to be out campaigning. 
Most of them are up for reelection, a number of them have opponents. 
It's not a practical thing to do. I think the key thing is not weather 
we have hearings before the election. I think the question is can 
we do this as expediously as possible? And I think we will do that. 
Henry Hyde has pledged to do what he can to get this accomplished 
before the end of the year, and I think he very sincerely means that. 
Well, it will go to the house to see whether the house votes, as I 
assume it will, because the republicans are continuing to carry on 
what is increasingly the aura of a partisan witch Hunt. And so I assume 
they will vote. There are some democratic votes but mostly not, to 
conduct this inquiry. And unfortunately, they rejected on a partly 
line vote the democratic alternative, which was basically to say, 
"all right, before you put the country through the trauma of a formal 
impeachment preceding, you should at least examine the allegations." 
House democrats are trying to develop strategy for the upcoming vote. 
Democratic leaders are trying to figure out how many party members 
will vote for the probe. One source says more than half will oppose 
the republican plan.
