Residents can go home, but 1,500 firefighters are still battling wildfires 
in southern California. One firefighter and an air tanker pilot have 
already died fighting the flames. Five structures have been destroyed. 
Two fires started yesterday about 90 miles east of Los Angeles. Santa 
Ana winds quickly whipped up the flames, and soon both merged into 
a 24,000 acre inferno. Residents of banning were evacuated, but later 
returned after the winds calmed.
