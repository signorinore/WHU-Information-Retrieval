This is Orelon Sidney from the CNN weather center with your "Headline 
News weather update." A trough of low pressure is extending across 
the Mississippi valley and into the gulf coast. Showers and thunderstorms 
will be numerous along this area of low pressure, as the front moves 
through the Great Lakes and into the central gulf. A high pressure 
Ridge will build in behind this, so fair skies and cooler temperatures 
are expected for the southern plains and the Rockies, but a new pacific 
storm system begins to enter the forecast, with showers possible from 
near San Francisco, northward into the puget sound. Temperatures will 
generally be in the 50s and 60s on Wednesday across the northern tier, 
with 70s and 80s in the south. You will see some 90s across the desert 
southwest. High temperatures will approach the 40s across portions 
of southern and southeast Alaska. Fairbanks sees a high of 34. Hilo 
will partly cloudy, and temperatures will be in the 80s. The extended 
forecast continues shower and thunderstorm chances across the eastern 
seaboard on Thursday, with rain showers possible in the pacific northwest. 
Temperatures will remain cool in the north and cooling across the 
northwest, as we head into Saturday.
