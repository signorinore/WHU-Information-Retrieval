A south Florida ad agency and an unidentified client are giving life 
to the adage that God works in mysterious ways. John Zarrella explains. 
It's a miserable, hot October afternoon in south Florida. The car 
air conditioner doesn't work. Traffic is bumper-to-bumper on the asphalt 
carpet. You're thinking how it's hot as -- well, you know. You see 
a sign on the side of a bus. It reads -- "if you think it's hot here." 
Signed, God. You're sure you're just delusional from the heat. Then, 
as you sweat and mutter a few expletives, you see it again. This time 
a billboard. It reads -- "keep using my name in vain. I'll make rush 
hour longer." Signed, God. Turns out, signs like this are all over 
south Florida. It's an advertising campaign put together by a local 
agency. The audience that we are targeting are individuals that perhaps 
were religious at one point in their life and they kind of drifted 
away. The approach the ad execs came up with was, in their words, 
to portray God as a regular guy with messages like -- "let's meet 
at my house Sunday before the game." It seemed like the natural way 
to reach the people we are trying to reach with a message to make 
them think a little bit. While the agency developed the campaign, 
it's not the sponsor. The client doesn't want anyone to know who he 
or she is or how much money the campaign is costing. The individual 
that is behind this is doing it for one reason, and that is to make 
people more aware of God. It's hard not to be when a billboard smacks 
you in the face. It's about time somebody started advertising about 
God, because this world has kind of lost interest in him, and the 
world's all messed up. It impressed me, and it really stands out once 
you see it as it passes by. The anonymity of the sponsor has made 
the campaign all the more intriguing. So far, no one has been able 
to figure out who's behind it. So, what was your first reaction? Thank 
God! Maybe that's the answer. John Zarrella, CNN, Miami.
