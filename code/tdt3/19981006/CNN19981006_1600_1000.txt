GM is merging. The move is expected to result in some job cuts. GM 
hopes it will reduce the time and money it spends on new car models. 
GM currently has the highest production costs of the three auto makers 
and is still feeling some Negative effects of the strike. I think 
we are pretty much really on the way back and actually we'll have 
more strong production in sales through the last quarter because we 
are getting good reception to a lot of new products. We got a new 
full size pickup which is going to be super hot. We got pent up demand 
at the dealer and customer level. We are going to try to come out 
fast from that tough situation on the strike. GM's initiative follows 
a similar restructuring by Ford three years ago.
