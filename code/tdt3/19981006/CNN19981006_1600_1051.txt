The government is scrutinizing some fees that boost your long-distance 
Bill. The federal communications commission is considering lowering 
so-called "access fees" charged by local phone carriers to connect 
long-distance calls. The fees are passed along to customers and make 
up about 40% of a monthly long-distance Bill. Some local phone companies 
argue that lowering the fees would lead to increased local rates.
