Big bird and friends are drawing some big criticism. Consumer advocate 
Ralph nader is urging parents to protest "Sesame street"'s decision 
to accept corporate sponsorship. Children's television workshop, makers 
of "Sesame street," have broadcast commercial-free programming for 
over 30 years. But recently, they signed a $1 million sponsorship 
deal with discovery zone and plan to add two additional sponsors in 
the future. Children's television workshop says the move is necessary 
because of decreased funding from public television.
