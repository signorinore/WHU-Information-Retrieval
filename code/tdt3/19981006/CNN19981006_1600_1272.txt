For the boys of summer, it's down to the final four. I'm Anthony Keith 
James, and this is "Headline Sports." The Indians and Yankees face 
off tonight in game one of the alcs. New York looking for redemption 
against the team that knocked them out of the playoffs a year ago. 
Tonight, it'll be jaret Wright against David Wells. It's gonna be 
pitching. You know, pitching will -- hopefully it will dominate, 'cause 
I feel that we have the capabilities to do that. But again, if you 
don't pitch, they're going to let you know about it. I feel like we 
gotta play, you know, almost perfect baseball because they got a great 
ball club. Look at how many games they won. Look how they mowed down 
Texas, so we just can't make a lot of mistakes. The first pitch of 
this year's nlcs between the Braves and padres will be thrown tomorrow. 
John smoltz goes against Kevin Ashby.
