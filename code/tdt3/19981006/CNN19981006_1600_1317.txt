San Francisco 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. has pleaded guilty to 
knowing about an alleged extortion scheme involving former Louisiana 
governed edwin Edwards. And that could impact his standing as an NFL 
team owner. As part of a plea agreement, DeBartolo is being placed 
on probation and assessed $1 million in fines. The case stems from 
an investigation of the former governor's role in Louisiana's river 
boat casino industry.
