"Headline News," I'm Lynne Russell. President Clinton is calling on 
all countries to do their part to stem the tide of global financial 
turmoil. Today, he spoke at the annual meeting of the international 
monetary fund and the world bank. He urged financial leaders to adopt 
long-term reforms. And he called on Congress to approve $18 billion 
for the IMF. He says immediate action is necessary to restore economic 
stability. I am confident that if we act together we can end the current 
crisis. We must take urgent steps to help those who have been hurt 
by it, to limit the reach of it and to restore growth and confidence 
to the world economy. But even when the current crisis subsides, that 
will not be enough. The global economy simply cannot live with the 
vast and systemic disruptions that have occured over the past year. 
The IMF and the world bank have been vital to the prosperity of the 
world for the past half century.
