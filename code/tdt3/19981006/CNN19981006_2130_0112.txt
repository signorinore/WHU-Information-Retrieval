Treasury secretary Robert Rubin met with U.N. secretary-general Kofi 
Annan tonight to discuss how the United Nations can help stabilize 
the world economy. A spokesman for Annan says the secretary-general 
urged greater debt relief for developing countries and more money 
to promote development. Secretary Rubin says it's important to deal 
with the economic crisis now before things get worse. If you look 
at most private sector forecasts, they tend to remain pretty much 
unchanged so far. And my own sense of it is that the most likely outlook 
by far, actually, for our economy is a continuation of solid growth 
and low inflation. However, however, some sectors have been very much 
affected. Agriculture obviously. The treasury department released 
a study showing the state by state impact. U.S. chemical product exporteds 
to Asia are down. Economists say a loss of exports could translate 
into a loss of American jobs. Most of the good and -- good quality 
jobs in the U.S., well-paid jobs are export related jobs. In order 
for our country to export, we have to have buyers and many of our 
buyers are in Latin America. With Latin America in the brink, then 
there is serious probability that many of those buyers will go away 
if Brazil goes under. That will mean that people will not be able 
to have the same kind of jobs that they have now.
