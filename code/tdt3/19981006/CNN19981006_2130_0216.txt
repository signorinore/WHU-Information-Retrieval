During his speech to the IMF, President Clinton also discussed the 
violence in Kosovo. He said the conflict there could threaten peace 
and stability throughout the Balkans. He is calling on Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic to honor U.N. resolutions to end hostilities against 
ethnic Albanians and allow them to return home. What is already a 
humanitarian crisis could turn into a catastrophe. Some 250,000 people 
have been forced to flee their homes. Of that number, approximately 
50,000 are actually homeless. As winter sets in, they risk freezing 
or starving to death.
