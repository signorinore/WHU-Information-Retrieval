Should air strikes be called for in Kosovo, they could come from the 
"USS Eisenhower" which is positioned off the coast of Yugoslavia for 
previously scheduled NATO war games. Mike Hanna is aboard the Eisenhower. 
On this occasion, an exercise but within days perhaps it could be 
the real thing. Just off the coast of Yugoslavia, a massive NATO deployment 
called operation dynamic mix. And aboard the "U.S.S. Eisenhower," 
the aviators are flying some 100 sorties each day. This exercise has 
been months in the planning involving nearly 20,000 men and women 
from 11 countries and 10 navies. Its purely coincidental say officers 
that this force happens to be in the right place at the right time, 
prepared at any moment to pause the exercise and launch a punitive 
strike against what NATO regards as the aggression of Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic. We try and keep the focus of our personnel honed 
in on what they're doing and the exercises that they're participating 
in. Realizing, always, we're just a step away from the real thing. 
We know what's going on in the world around us and that may cause 
folks to put a little edge on the types of things they're doing and 
pay a little closer attention and that means will get that much better 
training. Vessels like the "U.S.S. aegis" will be central players 
in any strike action. Loaded in some of the 61 cells on the Stern 
deck -- tomahawk missiles that would probably be the first weapons 
delivered on to Serbian soil. And on the "U.S.S. Eisenhower" a sample 
of the air power at the command of the U.S. and its NATO allies -- 
an awesome array of naval muscle flexing now in exercise, minutes 
away as the missile flies from Serb targets. Mike Hanna, CNN,aboard
