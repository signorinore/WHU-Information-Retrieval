Republican investigators say the democratic party has not returned 
more than $1.7 million in dubious donations. An interim report from 
the house committee investigating fund-raising abuses says the donations 
are either illegal or suspect. The money is in addition to the $3.2 
million the democrats already have returned. The report says controversial 
fund-raising figures such as James riady and John huang were connected 
to the donations. The democrats call the findings wildly exaggerated.
