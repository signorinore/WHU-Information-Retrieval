This is Orelon Sidney from the CNN weather center with your "Headline 
News weather update." A cold front will move across the Great Lakes, 
the Mississippi and Tennessee river valleys and the gulf of Mexico. 
Showers and thunderstorms can be numerous Wednesday stretching from 
saginaw, Michigan southward to mobile, Alabama. Look for a Ridge of 
high pressure to build into the southern plains and across portions 
of the Rockies, but a new cold front will move into the pacific northwest 
with showers from the California/Oregon border to back into Washington 
and British Columbia. High pressure holds on for one more day across 
the northeast. But the weather should be going downhill by Thursday. 
Temperatures will be in the 50s and 60s for the northern tier states 
with the southern regions in 70s and 80s. The desert southwest will 
still see highs in the 90s. On the extended forecast, rain and thunderstorms 
for the Great Lakes and the eastern seaboard can be expected on Thursday 
with showers and wind increasing Friday in the pacific northwest. 
Temperatures begin to cool in the northwest as well. By Saturday, 
50s cover most of the northern plains. You will see windy conditions 
into the eastern slopes of the Rockies. The forecast for more than 
6,000 cities is at CNN.com.
