EPA administrator Carol browner testified today at the corruption 
trial of former agriculture secretary Mike Espy. Espy is charged with 
accepting gifts and gratuities from companies regulated by the usda. 
Browner testified that Espy once told her ethics rules for Clinton 
cabinet members are quote "A bunch of junk, I'm going to do like I 
did in Congress." Browner claims during the same conversation, which 
included fellow cabinet members Ron brown and Bruce Babbitt, she learned 
that Espy and the late Ron brown, both black, had been tested for 
drug use. Browner says she and Babbitt, who are white, were not. Babbitt 
told CNN today he did, in fact, pass a drug test.
