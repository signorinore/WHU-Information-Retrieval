Some Americans may find themselves ill-equipped to judge the many 
candidates and political issues come election time. In this edition 
of tech trends, Ann Kellan reports on a new way to prepare. Negative 
political ads like these -- This smelled like government waste to 
me. My opponent things the job is done. Hey Al, stop messing with 
my Medicare. He said he wouldn't take special interest money. May 
be all you get on some candidates or issues. But starting this week 
through November 3rd, a new non-profit web site called web, white 
and blue can help you find out more. This icon appears at a number 
of popular web sites including Yahoo!, AOL, excite and CNN interactive. 
What you do is double click on that icon. It takes you to the web, 
white and blue site. From there, you can go to dozens of other web 
sites -- some giving you information about candidates and issues. 
If what you want is information on the New York Senate race, you click 
onto New York. You get the Senate race, and you can get all the information 
you want about that race. One of my favorite features is the fact 
you can enter your address or your zip code and through that find 
out who represents you in these different races. According to political 
scientist Michael rich, people with higher income and education will 
likely have Internet access to this information, others may not. Further 
polarizing those that have information and those who don't. It's not 
clear yet whether it going to result in more people voting. Organizers 
hope by putting this icon on a broad spectrum of web sites from ESPN 
sportszone to Hispanic online, it will jump start nonvoters to get 
out and vote. Ann Kellan, CNN, Atlanta.
