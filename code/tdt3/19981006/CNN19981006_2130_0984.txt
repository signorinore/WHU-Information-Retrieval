Consumer advocate Ralph nader is accusing "Sesame street" of selling 
out. Creators of the show, the children's television workshop, have 
signed a sponsorship deal with the company discovery zone, which makes 
indoor playgrounds. It is reportedly worth about $1 million. Nader 
wants parents to protest the decision. A "Sesame street" executive 
says the move is necessary because PBS has cut its funding. No commercials 
will air during the show.
