If you get a great deal on an airline ticket, it's probably nonrefundable. 
But that doesn't necessarily mean you'll lose money if your plans 
change. Stephanie Oswald has details in this edition of "working ahead." 
Travelers often are confused by what nonrefundable means when it comes 
to airline tickets. On one hand, if you cancel or change your flight, 
you won't get any money back. It's death, sickness, whatever, it's 
your ticket. On the other hand, most airlines will let you apply the 
face value of the canceled ticket toward the purchase of a new ticket 
but you'll also pay a penalty, usually $50 or $75. Sometimes there 
are restrictions on how ticket credit can be applied. The only caveat 
is that you have to be on the same routing. In other words, if the 
ticket was from Dallas to Los Angeles, you would have to be flying 
Dallas to Los Angeles. The only way to avoid the hassle? Buy a fully 
refundable ticket usually available for a nonrestricted, full fare. 
A full coach, or Y-fare ticket, is considered fully refundable, which 
means, you know, you'll pay $800 to fly from Atlanta to Miami and 
back. But if you want to make a change, either outbound or coming 
back or cancel the trip, you're gonna get all your money back. Another 
issue -- nonrefundable tickets are nontransferable, meaning new tickets 
must be issued in the same name appearing on the canceled ticket, 
no matter who paid for it. Airlines set a deadline for using ticket 
credits, usually up to one year. But savvy travelers can find ways 
to extend a ticket's life. Go ahead and make another reservation. 
Get it ticketed and then change it again. However, you're going to 
loose another $75, so it depends on how much you've spent for that 
ticket. So, for the price of the penalty fee, you'll extend the ticket's 
value for another year. Stephanie Oswald, CNN.
