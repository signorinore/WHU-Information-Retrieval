Jerome Jurenovich, "Headline Sports." Cleveland's jaret Wright didn't 
make out of the first, as the Yankees have jumped on top of game one 
of the American league championship series. San Diego and Atlanta 
square off in game one of the nlcs tomorrow night at Turner field. 
Andy Ashby will give Braves killer Kevin brown another day of rest 
and start opposite John smoltz. The main thing for me is just control 
my emotions and my excitement to a -- to a point where I can go out 
and do my job and be effective. The big reason why we're in this situation 
is because of the year Andy's had. And he's fresh, he's ready to go. 
And I just don't see any reason to push Kevin brown too much.
