This isn't just another Beatles impersonation group. Mark Scheerer 
introduces us to a new lonely hearts club band. Say the word and you'll 
be free say the word and be like me a rock band covering Beatles songs. 
How unique? A Beatle band? Wait a minute, there's a million Beatle 
-- "wanna-Beatles" around. No kidding. But this one, the fab faux, 
features will Lee, from Paul Shaffer's band on "late night with David 
Letterman" -- and Jimmy Vivino, from the Max Weinberg 7 on Conan O'Brien's 
show -- plus some of the finest session musicians in New York. There's 
five of them, because if the Beatles had played a lot of their later 
stuff live, they would've needed a little help from their friends. 
They would have had to have a back line of people or playing to a 
sequencer or a dat tape or something that would get -- all the acts 
do today. And tonight Mr. kite is topping the B-I-L-L-L-L-L Interestingly, 
they're only able to re-create a song like this, with its collages 
of backwards tapes and swirling noises, because of the recent release 
of the "Beatles' anthology series." It had outtakes that could be 
sampled. In the case of those pieces of tape, we were able to find, 
isolated on a "Beatles anthology" record, that thing, isolated, you 
know, in the clear, so we could play it along with us. o-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h 
l-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a l-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a la la la la Trumpeter Lew 
solof of blood, sweat and tears fame, joins the fab faux on "penny 
Lane." The band plays in public only about once a month. And, standing 
in the audience with your eyes closed, it's not hard to imagine that 
this is what it would sound like if John, Paul, George and Ringo had 
performed "sgt. Pepper's" and "white album" material live. In meanwhile 
back What do you think the surviving Beatles would make of all this? 
I don't really know, you know? 'cause I mean they've been there before, 
they've done that. They may -- they may -- they may be insanely jealous 
that they never got a chance to perform it themselves and feel, "if 
we did, we'd be laughed at or corny." Say the word love say the word 
love say the word love say the W-O-O-O-R-D love The fab faux -- for 
these Beatles-maniacs, it's a labor of love. And, of course, that's 
all you need. Mark Scheerer, "CNN Entertainment News," New York.
