Good evening. This is the way the world works -- until earlier this 
year, Kosovo was so obscure, it's likely very few people, even in 
Europe, could identify its location or politics. But now, Kosovo is 
a war cry for the United States and its NATO allies. The province 
of Yugoslavia that is home to ethnic Albanians has been brutalized 
by Yugoslavia to the point that, today, President Clinton issued this 
warning -- Kosovo is a powder keg in the Balkans. If the violence 
continues, it could spill over and threaten the peace and stability 
of Bosnia, of Albania, of Macedonia and other countries in the region. 
What is already a humanitarian crisis could turn into a catastrophe.
