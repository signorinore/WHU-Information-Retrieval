The possibility of NATO military action against Yugoslavia and its 
hard-line President Slobodan Milosevic tonight seems imminent. But 
as NBC's Jim Miklaszewski reports, President Clinton's political opponents 
have some pointed questions. Today, in the Mediterranean, the U.S. 
carrier "Eisenhower" and its battle group steaming toward Kosovo. 
Moving ever closer to NATO air strikes against Serb forces. But back 
in Washington, the shooting has already started. Republicans on the 
Senate armed services committee attacked defense secretary William 
Cohen, claiming the Clinton administration has no coherent policy 
or plan toward Kosovo. None of us has ever heard, "okay, we're going 
to do A, B, C and D, and this will get the certain results." All we've 
heard is what we know in the media. And that is, the media points 
out, there is going to be some, "air strikes." And what happens after 
air strikes? Today, for the first time, the administration said that 
a peacekeeping force, like the one now in Bosnia, would likely be 
needed to enforce a Kosovo cease-fire. That could mean U.S. ground 
troops would be committed indefinitely. It's a possibility, but one 
that I have urged, we not get involved on the ground in Kosovo. Today, 
President Clinton's top foreign policy team met at the White House 
to put finishing touches on plans for air strikes. Cruise missiles, 
fired from U.S. warships and B-52s would take out Yugoslav air defenses. 
Followed by U.S. warplanes, including B-2 stealth bombers could then 
be used in a sustained bombing campaign. In Kosovo's capital Pristina, 
today, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke continued last-ditch diplomatic 
efforts. But Holbrooke stressed, only Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic can head off air strikes by calling off his brutal crackdown 
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. If he thinks NAto is bluffing, 
if he wants to take that risk, all I can do is convey to him the view 
of our government on the seriousness of the situation. Tonight, U.S. 
officials are confident Milosevic will back down, voluntarily or by 
force. According to one administration official, he's got no choice.
