President Clinton's personal diplomatic representative in the area 
is Richard Holbrooke, the architect of the Bosnian peace efforts. 
And he met twice today with someone he know well by now, Yugoslavia's 
President Slobodan Milosevic, Yugoslavia's hard-line president. Milosevic 
is 57 years old. He was educated at Belgrade University. He's married 
with two children. With more on today's diplomatic efforts and the 
prospects of avoiding military action, here's NBC's Ron Allen in Kosovo. 
Slobodan Milosevic, an international outcast, blamed by the west for 
the wars that ripped apart the former Yugoslavia. A leader hailed 
by his supporters as a nationalist hero, but criticized by others 
as cruel, calculating, cunning. He is ruthless on the one hand. He 
can use force and aggression with a ruthless attack. And then in the 
next sentence, he appears to be diplomatic and friendly. Opponents 
say the former banker turned communist party boss is obsessed with 
power. The product of a troubled childhood, both parents committed 
suicide. Today, critics say he has masterminded three bloody wars 
and has repeatedly outmaneuvered the United States and its allies. 
Milosevic has been smart. And that perhaps is what distinguishes him 
for the most part from all the other dictators we've come across. 
Rarely seen in public, the Yugoslav president's dream has always been 
to unite the Serb people in a single nation. The cost so far, more 
than 100,000 dead, millions of refugees. Now Milosevic, who launched 
his career whipping up nationalist fervor in Kosovo in the late '80s 
is cracking down on Albanians in that province. He is accused of atrocities 
in the name of defending Serb honor and tradition. Milosevic rose 
to power by ruthlessly taking away the rights of the Albanian people 
and creating the conditions for the current crisis. a crisis enflamed 
when Milosevic denounced threatened NATO strikes as a "criminal act." 
While the outside world now condemns Milosevic for the atrocities 
in Kosovo, his countrymen rally to his cause, many hailing him as 
a savior of the Serbs. Ron Allen, NBC news, Kosovo.
