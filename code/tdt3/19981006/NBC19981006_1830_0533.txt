President Clinton was facing another crisis today beyond the Balkans 
and the impeachment inquiry against him. He met with many about the 
world bank for a pep talk and a Stern worning on how to deal with 
the world economic crisis can be solved, but everyone will have to 
work together to do it. NBC's Claire Shipman joins me from the White 
House. Claire? Tom, it was a strong warning today from Bill Clinton, 
as the White House tries to take a lead role in navigating a way out 
of the world's financial crisis. The message was meant for the gathering 
of the world's economic bosses and also the U.S. Congress and the 
American people. We must find a way to temper the volatile swings 
of the international marketplace, just as we have learned to do in 
our own domestic economies. What is troubling today is how quickly 
discouraging news in one country can set off alarms in markets around 
the world. Both the White House and U.S. allies are frustrated that 
the republican Congress has yet to approve an $18 billion payment 
to the international monetary fund, whose job it is to help bail out 
failing economies. Republicans question how the IMF will spend the 
money. The White House tried to show how the crisis is hitting home 
with this treasury department study which shows that U.S. exports 
to Asia this year have dropped by 11%. No state is unaffected. In 
Washington state, for example, lumber and wood product exports fell 
by 45%. And in New York, agricultural exports to Asia are down by 
31%. Many experts and allies aploud the president today for his vision 
and leadership. But still exfresz frustration for the lack of a specific 
plan. One idea being floated an international economic summit to be 
held in London in November but the U.S. has yet to sign on. tom? Thanks, 
very much. Claire Shipman at the White House.
