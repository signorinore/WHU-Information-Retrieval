NBC news "in depth" -- a deadly killer and what women need to know 
about it. The numbers leave no doubt that breast cancer is a grave 
threat to American women. This year, an estimated 180,000 women in 
this country will be diagnosed with the disease. More than 43,000 
will die from it. And even though women are bombarded with information 
about the disease, a new survey tonight points to some alarming misconceptions. 
NBC's Anne Thompson, on what so many women don't know about breast 
cancer. Ribbons and races and revelations by celebrities, like singer 
Olivia Newton-John, make women more aware of breast cancer, but not 
necessarily better informed. Today's survey found that most women 
over 40 cannot identify the important risk factors for the disease, 
and worse yet, underestimate their own risk of getting it. Just the 
fact you're a woman, you're at risk for breast cancer. When asked 
to name risk factors, women got some right and some wrong. Correct 
-- 56% named family history, 8% age, and 7% personal breast cancer 
history. Wrong -- diet, identified by almost 20%, not a proven breast 
cancer risk factor. I think that people really identified the family 
history as the major risk factor, but they really missed the issue 
of age, which is the primary risk factor for breast cancer. As a woman's 
age increases, so does her risk. Up to age 34, her chances are 1 in 
622. It jumps to one in eight by age 85. Still, almost half the women 
over 65 don't recognize the danger and believe they are at low or 
no risk for the disease. They are the group that are least likely 
to get a mammography. Less than half of them get mammography. And 
remember, that's a population where it's paid for by Medicare. At 
the Y-me breast cancer hot line based in Chicago, Judy periotti says 
misconceptions abound because science still can not answer the question 
every woman wants to know. We can't say to a woman, "you developed 
breast cancer because you did 'X.'" But they do say, know the risk 
factors and take action. The national cancer institute says women 
40 and older should get mammograms every one to two years. Anne Thompson,
