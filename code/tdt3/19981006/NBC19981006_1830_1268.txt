Now to a "fleecing of America" that's disturbing, not just for the 
amount of taxpayer money wasted, but for the people who've been affected. 
They're some of this country's most vulnerable citizens. As NBC's 
Rehema Ellis tells us, that's what makes this "fleecing of America" 
particularly cruel. They are some of the country's neediest. I keep 
getting sicker and sicker. Robbed of their faculties by serious mental 
illness. To protect their privacy we cannot reveal their faces. But 
two government reports out this week show overwhelming evidence a 
Medicare benefit program designed to help them is actually robbing 
taxpayers. This is one of the worst cases of abuse that we've ever 
found. It's a $350 million benefit program called "partial hospitalization." 
It is supposed to be a cheaper alternative than hospitals providing 
treatment at community mental health centers for patients with severe 
psychiatric needs. It's supposed to save Medicare money. But federal 
health officials find that some of the nation's 1,100 centers are 
stealing Medicare money, a massive "fleecing of America." Their reports 
find nearly all of the bills, an alarming 2%, are, at best, questionable 
and, at worst, fraudulent. But, even more disturbing, Medicare simply 
paid all these claims, $229 million, that's just for one year, in 
only five states. Medicare paid some bills for services that had nothing 
to do with mental health. We found community mental health centers 
where people were basically being warehoused. People were playing 
bingo or watching television. That's not a Medicare benefit. Medicare 
paid bills to companies claiming to run community mental health centers. 
But, in fact, they were not like the one housed in this Miami office 
building. And Medicare paid for patients who were not eligible, in 
some cases, not mentally ill at all. One example, the case of a 97-year-old 
Florida woman in a simple day care program -- she was shocked to learn 
it was billed to Medicare as expensive therapy. The government says 
that some centers even charged the program for holiday gifts and decorations, 
Flowers, golf fees, even vacations. And billed them all as patient 
costs. How could this happen? We think this fraud has been perpetrated 
by a group of unethical health care providers against the Medicare 
program and the Medicare beneficiaries themselves. Mental health advocates 
and government officials agree that treating the mentally ill at legitimate 
community centers is still a good idea. But for now, the centers that 
are abusing the program are hurting it with another "fleecing of America."
