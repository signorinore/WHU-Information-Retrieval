I'll have a glass of chardonnay,'' the lady says. Her male companion 
adds, ``Make it a glass of merlot for me.'' Wine by the glass: how 
au courant, how American. Or is it? At Le Rubi, a little cafe I frequent 
near the Place Vendome in Paris, the first wine drinkers of the day 
appear around 10:30 a.m. Workmen on their morning break, they call 
for ``un p't rouge'' _ a small glass of red wine. At midday the suits 
crowd in: office workers, ministry clerks, junior MBAs from the banks. 
They order the plat du jour and wash it down with a glass of Bordeaux 
rouge or a cru Beaujolais like Morgon or Julienas. No one orders by 
the bottle. In Paris, wine by the glass has been trendy for a hundred 
years. Actually, people have drunk wine by the glass for longer than 
that, as there is really no other way to get at it, other than swilling 
from the bottle, which is uncouth, or squirting it from a goat-skin 
bag, which is unsanitary if you're out of practice. In the United 
States, ordering by the glass did not become a widespread practice 
until the 1970s, when wine first became popular among trend-setters. 
At first it was a discreet way to mask one's ignorance. Murmuring 
``Just a glass of white wine please'' sounds a lot better than ``I 
don't know one wine from another.'' Then someone came up with the 
Cruvinet, and ordering wine by the glass became part of the bar scene. 
The Cruvinet is a brass-trimmed glass cabinet in which opened bottles 
of wine are hooked up to a source of nitrogen. As the wine is served 
out by the glass, the nitrogen fills the empty space in the bottle. 
No air gets in, and the wine, theoretically, can last for days. The 
one-bottle Cruvinet became the three-bottle Cruvinet and eventually 
the 25- and 30-bottle Cruvinet. Then, as quickly as it had arrived, 
the Cruvinet all but disappeared. Bartenders noticed that the bottles 
that lasted for days were wines no one particularly wanted and that 
bottles of popular wines were soon emptied _ even the most expensive 
ones. There was no need to preserve them in a glass case like Vladimir 
Ilyich Lenin. Nevertheless, wine by the glass had arrived. Gradually, 
the standard request moved up the scale from ``a glass of white wine'' 
to ``a glass of chablis,'' to ``a glass of chardonnay.'' Or cabernet, 
or merlot. As more and more restaurants added wines by the glass to 
their wine lists, even a difficult-to-pronounce wine could be ordered 
without loss of face. ``I'll have a glass of No. 6'' would usually 
do the trick. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, wine consumption 
faltered because of stricter controls on drunken driving, general 
concerns about alcohol and health, and an economic downturn. Then, 
with widely publicized claims that wine could actually be good for 
you, coupled with a brighter economy, wine bounced back. And with 
fitness as important as ever, having just a couple of glasses of wine 
at dinner made more sense than drinking a whole bottle. ``Drink less 
but better'' became a popular slogan. Moreover, a new group of wine 
drinkers had emerged: more knowledgeable, more discerning, more adventurous. 
They wanted to try different wines but they were not prepared to buy 
full bottles just to experiment. In fact, the staggering increases 
in wine prices have made it almost impossible for restaurantgoers 
of moderate means to sample many sought-after wines. A couple celebrating 
an anniversary at a prominent New York restaurant might be put off 
by the $90 price for a bottle of good Champagne. But they might be 
able to swing two glasses at $17 each. Some restaurants, like Gramercy 
Tavern in New York, offer wine by the glass and by the taste. Not 
sure if the Tulocay Winery's Haynes Vineyard pinot noir is what you 
want with dinner? Try a three-ounce taste for $4.50. At I Trulli, 
another Manhattan restaurant, wine by the glass is supplemented by 
wine by the flight, served at Enoteca, a wine bar adjoining the restaurant. 
A flight is a group of wines to be sampled together. One flight consists 
of two ounces each of three Tuscan wines: two 1995 Chianti Classicos 
_ one from Rodano, the other from Rocca di Castagnoli _ and a 1994 
Sassoalloro from Biondi-Santi. The flight costs $13.25. By the glass, 
the wines are $6.25, $7.75 and $12.25, respectively. During the fall, 
Enoteca is offering a weekly series of flights of more expensive Italian 
wines weekly. Next week a $36 flight of three so-called Super-Tuscans 
will be featured: the Solaia 1993, Sassicaia 1994 and Ornellaia 1994. 
SoHo Kitchen and Bar, one of New York's oldest wine bars _ and one 
of its best _ offers more than 100 wines by the glass and more than 
20 flights, including, for the exceptionally self-assured, a mystery 
flight of three whites and three reds. The Hudson Club in Chicago 
also pours about 100 different wines, but the mother of all wine bars 
is probably the Panorama Ristorante in Philadelphia, which offers 
about 120 wines by the glass. Since it is unlikely that each of those 
wines will be ordered every day, most large wine bars use some kind 
of refrigeration and preservation system. Panorama and the Hudson 
Club use a system called Wine Keeper, which costs about $40,000, said 
Curt Burns, the wine director of the Hudson Club. But even the machines, 
which resemble props from the Sci-fi Channel, are not infallible. 
Maria de Corpo, the wine buyer for Mistral, a restaurant and wine 
bar in Santa Rosa, Calif., told Cheers, a trade publication, that 
spoilage was still a major problem and that it was important to feature 
what the customers liked most. In other words, turnover is everything 
_ just as at Le Rubis.
