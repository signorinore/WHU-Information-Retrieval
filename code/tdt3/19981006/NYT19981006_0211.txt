Q: I am looking for a recipe using chickpea flour, water and olive 
oil to make a flat wafer I saw in a French travelogue. Any ideas? 
A: The flat wafer you are looking for is called socca. It is a savory 
treat sold in the Cours Saleya open-air market in old Nice. Vendors 
set up little stands in the market stalls and sell warm squares of 
the salty snack folded into brown paper cones. Socca is easy to make, 
provided you have a very hot oven, which transforms the thin batter 
into a cake with a texture halfway between a pancake and a fritter. 
Below is a recipe adapted from Mireille Johnston's ``Cuisine of the 
Sun'' (Biscuit Books, 1996). You can buy chickpea flour in Italian 
and Middle Eastern markets, and in fancy-food shops. To Wilt a Melon 
Q: I'm very fond of melons, but for health reasons can't eat raw fruit. 
Can you provide any recipes for cooking melons that retain their flavor 
and, hopefully, their texture? A: There is a reason why recipes for 
cooked melon are so few: The fruit turns pulpy because it contains 
a lot of water, which it gives up when heated enough to cook it through. 
Traditionally, melons are cooked only to preserve them _ for example, 
to candy or pickle them, or to make them into jam. None of these preparations 
retain the juicy-crisp texture of fresh melon, and the sugar, salt 
or spices necessary in the preserving markedly affect the flavor. 
Sweet Upper Lip Q: I have come across several dessert recipes (for 
cheesecake, for example) that require something called castor sugar. 
I have had no success in finding a store that carries this, let alone 
knows what it is. Where can I get it? A: Castor sugar is actually 
the British name for extra-fine, or superfine, sugar. (This is not 
the same as powdered, or confectioners', sugar.) Its fine grain lets 
it dissolve almost instantly in liquid, making it well suited to sweetening 
meringues and cold drinks. However, some older British cookbooks _ 
those by Elizabeth David, for example _ call for castor sugar routinely, 
even when granulated would do. For foods that don't require the instant 
dissolution of the sugar, such as most cakes and pastries, the same 
amount of regular granulated sugar is perfectly fine. By the way, 
it is easy to make your own superfine sugar. Simply whirl sugar in 
the food processor for several minutes. Use it in any recipe calling 
for superfine or castor sugar _ or, for that matter, granulated sugar. 
SOCCA Adapted from ``The Cuisine of the Sun'' Time: 25 minutes, plus 
1 hour for batter to rest 1 cup water 2/3 cup chickpea flour 3 tablespoons 
fruity olive oil, plus more for drizzling 1/2 teaspoon salt, plus 
more for sprinkling Freshly ground black pepper 1. In a large bowl, 
mix together all ingredients but pepper. Let batter rest 1 hour. 2. 
Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Oil a 10-inch round baking pan and 
pour in the batter. Bake the pancake until it sets, about 6 minutes. 
Drizzle the top with olive oil. Turn on the broiler and broil until 
the top is crisp and golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes longer. 3. Remove 
socca from the oven and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Cut 
into wedges and serve, in the spirit of Nice, with a chilled aperitif 
wine. Yield: 6 servings.
