Miguel Torres Mas La Plana 1994 Penedes, Spain. About $35. When this 
wine, which is 100 percent cabernet sauvignon, was introduced in 1970, 
it was known as Gran Coronas Black Label. It was created by Miguel 
Torres Jr., who joined the family business in the early 1960s and 
introduced French grape varieties to the Penedes region, southwest 
of Barcelona. The cabernet vines were planted in the Milmanda Vineyard 
in 1966. Until the mid-1980s, the wine was rich and tannic, apparently 
too much so for the Spanish market. Even though the wine was immensely 
popular elsewhere, its style was softened to conform more to that 
of most Spanish reds. In the early 1990s, it reverted somewhat to 
the earlier versions, with more structure. This 1994 embodies the 
best of both styles: rich, opaque and intensely flavored. It would 
be just right for Thanksgiving; it will also last for 15 years.
