A bill that is likely to lead to a showdown between the Japanese government 
and foreign investors has passed the Lower House of Parliament and 
is expected to win Upper House approval by the time the current legislative 
session ends later this month. At issue is the government's plans 
to shift debt of 180 billion yen, or $1.34 billion at current exchange 
rates, onto the seven railway companies formed when the national railroad 
system was privatized more than a decade ago. The presidents of the 
seven companies, led by Masatake Matsuda, the outspoken former bureaucrat 
who is president of the East Japan Railway Co., have vowed to fight 
the measure, contending it violates their shareholders' rights by 
illegally changing the terms of the privatization. They are also concerned 
that at a time when Japanese companies are increasingly forced to 
turn to global capital markets for financing, the government's actions 
may inhibit the rail companies' ability to issue bonds. Their cause 
has been joined by two U.S. Senators _ Massachusetts Democrat John 
Kerry and New York Republican Alfonse D'Amato _ as well as several 
large foreign institutional shareholders. The government has backed 
down somewhat. Its original proposal was to shift twice as much of 
the debt to the privatized companies. The debt is part of the old 
national railway's underfinanced pension liabilities. In a move widely 
seen as an attempt to divide and conquer, the government's revised 
bill includes some subsidized loans for four of the companies, which 
are operating with losses. The debts the government took on as part 
of the privatization have ballooned to $220 billion from $173 billion, 
and officials say that without the legislation the taxpayers will 
have to pay for the pension liabilities. The railways have rejected 
that assertion. At a news conference Tuesday, Matsuda said that the 
government could have retired its portion of the old railroad system's 
debt by using the money from the privatization as well as payments 
the railways make for the high-speed train, the Shinkansen, but, he 
said, officials opted to spend the money on other things. He again 
asserted that the bill passed by the Lower House violated shareholders' 
rights. ``If we allow shareholders to be deprived of profits without 
rational reasons, it means the collapse of the modern state and the 
free economy set up with corporations at the core,'' he said. Matsuda 
stopped short of repeating a previous threat he has made to sue the 
government, saying he thought it was possible to gain support for 
the rail companies' position in the Upper House and thwart passage 
of the bill. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party lacks a majority 
in the Upper House, but two smaller opposition parties have given 
their support to the bill in the Lower House. Their members are expected 
to do the same in the Upper House, giving the dominant party the needed 
votes.
