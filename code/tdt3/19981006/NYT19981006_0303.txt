A bill that would allow the Clinton administration to spend nearly 
$100 million to aid Iraqi opposition groups seeking the ouster of 
President Saddam Hussein is moving rapidly through Congress, with 
final approval virtually certain. The House approved the bill on Monday, 
by a vote of 360 to 38, and passage of the so-called Iraq Liberation 
Act by the Senate is expected shortly. The White House is seeking 
some changes in the bill, including a clearer definition of which 
groups would be permitted to receive the aid and the scope of the 
assistance that could be given to them. But administration officials 
say they are likely to support whatever eventually emerges from Capitol 
Hill, especially since it is not binding on the White House. Even 
at a time of domestic political turmoil, the White House and Congress 
agree on the need for the United States to do what it can to bring 
about the ouster of Saddam. The legislation would permit _ but not 
require _ the president to spend up to $97 million in arms and other 
assistance to rebel groups seeking to replace Saddam with a democratic 
government. It would also provide $2 million to Radio Free Iraq, a 
broadcast service that was set up under earlier legislation, and it 
calls for the administration to press for a United Nations international 
criminal tribunal to prosecute Saddam and other Iraqi leaders found 
guilty of war crimes. ``This bill will give our government additional 
tools with which to confront the threat to international peace and 
security posed by Saddam Hussein,'' said Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., 
who is chairman of the House International Relations Committee. Administration 
officials said that while they support the intent of the bill, they 
are concerned about the mechanism for providing money and arms to 
the Iraqi opposition, which includes dozens of groups, many of them 
feuding. They said it might also weaken support for international 
sanctions on Iraq. ``No one should underestimate the difficulty of 
unifying the Iraqi opposition,'' said Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana, 
the ranking Democrat on the International Relations Committee. But 
he noted that because the bill is nonbinding, it ``states the sense 
of the U.S. Congress; it it does not change U.S. policy.''
