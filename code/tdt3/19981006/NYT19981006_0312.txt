Nobody is calling the stars of ``Charmed'' lightweight, but when three 
red-blooded young witches stand inside a circle of fire, chanting 
to destroy an enemy, surely they should look and sound a little fiercer 
than college girls playing ``Charlie's Angels.'' This WB series, which 
has its premiere Wednesday night, seems to want to be a dark dramatic 
version of ``Sabrina the Teen-Age Witch Grows Up'' or ``Bewitched: 
The Single Years.'' Unfortunately, it just manages to make witchcraft 
look bland. The heroines of ``Charmed,'' familiar faces in prime time, 
are Prue (Shannen Doherty of ``Beverly Hills 90210''), Piper (Holly 
Marie Combs, ``Picket Fences'') and Phoebe (Alyssa Milano, ``Who's 
the Boss?''), great-looking sisters in their 20's recently reunited 
after a relative's death. They've just moved in together in a nifty 
old house in San Francisco that has been in their family for several 
generations. Things start to happen immediately. Their old Ouija board 
tells them to check out the attic. There, a huge, dusty ``Book of 
Shadows'' informs them that they are witches. Not just any old broom-riding, 
nose-wiggling, eye-of-newt-adding practitioners, but ``the most powerful 
witches the world has ever known.'' Phoebe embraces this news and 
promptly saves two boys on in-line skates by foreseeing an accident 
and preventing it. At cooking school, Piper is a little shocked when 
she is able to freeze time long enough to finish the port sauce and 
impress the teacher. Prue is the stubborn one, skeptical even after 
asking for the cream and watching the pitcher slide down the counter 
and pour a bit of its contents into her coffee. This is all happening 
at a particularly bad time. As one open-minded observer concludes, 
the recent wave of homicides in which all the victims were young women 
means that somebody is killing witches. The sisters' boyfriends, past 
and present, include a policeman and a newspaper reporter, so naturally 
they're interested in this crime spree. The killer's identity does 
come as a surprise, but where to go from here? It would be nice if 
the women could grow in confidence as the weeks go by, but it seems 
doubtful that they'll do it convincingly. When Prue asks, ``I mean, 
do witches date?'' it's a nice post-modern approach, but there's a 
little too much ``Ally McBeal'' attitude for comfort. (What? Little 
insecure me a witch?) ``We're going to be careful,'' vows Prue at 
the end of the first episode, speaking for herself and her sisters. 
``We're going to be wise. And we're going to stick together.'' Well, 
OK. But wouldn't it be more fun if Endora paid a visit and turned 
Darrin into a horse? PRODUCTION NOTES: `CHARMED' WB, Wednesday night
