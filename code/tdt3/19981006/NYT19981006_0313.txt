The much debated Hay Wadsworth daguerreotype, dated 1843 and thought 
by some to be the first image of Abraham Lincoln, failed to sell at 
Christie's on Tuesday. The auctioneer started the bidding at $110,000 
and, after two bids, stopped at $150,000, below the secret reserve 
price and the estimate of $200,000 to $300,000. Several experts had 
suggested that the image, if it were that of the 16th president, could 
fetch $1 million or more. But experts have argued about whether the 
person photographed is Lincoln ever since the consignors, Robert and 
Joan Hoffman of Pittsford, a suburb of Rochester, unveiled it in 1993. 
The Hoffmans got the three-and-a-half by three-inch leather-encased 
image from the liquidator for the descendants of Lincoln's private 
secretary, John Milton Hay. In 1843, 18 years before Lincoln became 
president, he was a beardless Illinois state legislator who had not 
yet grown into the man who appears on the $5 bill. To support their 
contention that the daguerreotype sitter was Lincoln, the Hoffmans 
and several other believers put the image through a range of analyses, 
from criminal identification techniques to computer ``aging'' to scrutiny 
of the vein patterns in the subject's hand. The doubters, including 
many Lincoln historians and artists, simply pointed out the differences 
in facial features of the man in the Hoffmans' image and the earliest 
documented likeness of Lincoln, taken between 1846 and 1849 and now 
in the Library of Congress. The Hoffmans, who bought the daguerreotype 
in 1993 for a sum they will not disclose, decided during the summer 
to let the market rule. ``We're sorry it didn't sell,'' an obviously 
disappointed Hoffman said, adding, ``We wanted it to go to the next 
level of custodians,'' preferably a public institution. But he said 
he still believed the image was Lincoln's. ``This is an ongoing process,'' 
Hoffman said. ``We are talking about more research _ there's a tremendous 
amount of new photo analysis coming available in the next few years.''
