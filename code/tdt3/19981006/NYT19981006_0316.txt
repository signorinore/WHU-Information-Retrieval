Secretary of State Madeleine Albright issued a new warning Tuesday 
that the time for negotiating peace was running out. As both sides 
haggled over an interim agreement a far more difficult subject, the 
permanent status of their relationship, was barely broached. Wearing 
dangling dove earrings, a dove brooch and a dove necklace, Albright 
was whisked from Jerusalem to Jericho and back for separate meetings 
with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian 
leader. By late evening the two men had agreed to a meeting with Albright 
on Wednesday morning at the Erez checkpoint between Israel and Palestinian-controlled 
Gaza. While a cloud of mistrust between the two sides still hangs 
over the talks, all concur that the stonewalling has ended and negotiations 
have a fresh momentum. Still, Albright's spokesman, James Rubin, said 
this does not mean that an agreement is at hand or even that the peace 
process is back on track _ but rather that ``we can see ahead of us 
a way to put it back on track.'' In her first visit here in more than 
a year, Albright said she had spent ``one of the pleasanter mornings 
of my time in the region.'' But she said ``much work'' needed to be 
done if an interim agreement was to be finalized at a three-party 
summit meeting in Washington later this month. And then, she said, 
the more difficult final negotiations would have to begin under extreme 
time pressure. The tentative peace accord signed in Oslo expires in 
May, and Arafat has said he will declare a Palestinian state then 
if an agreement has not been made final. ``While the issues on the 
table now are important, the parties need to reach agreement so they 
can move on to the more critical issues regarding permanent status,'' 
Albright said, standing beside Arafat and beneath a giant poster of 
him in a meeting hall in Jericho. Both in Jerusalem and in Jericho, 
Albright reiterated the same warning, word for word: ``We all know 
that time is not on our side. If we don't move quickly, we may find 
ourselves without a process of peacemaking, without an agreement, 
and without the hope of achieving an Israeli-Palestinian peace.'' 
The secretary of state is spending two days here to pave the way for 
the Washington meeting, at which, if successful, President Clinton 
would preside over a breakthrough after 18 months of stalemate. Rubin 
played down expectations, however, saying the summit talks were envisioned 
as ``an intensive multi-day exercise where some heavy lifting is going 
to be required,'' adding, ``We do not envisage it as a photo op where 
everything is prepackaged and signed and sealed.'' Gripping a podium 
in Jericho, Arafat spoke generally, applauding ``the American initiative 
to salvage the peace process.'' But each side professed skepticism 
that Albright could wrest further concessions from the other during 
her visit here, and continued the chronic exercise of blaming the 
other for intransigence. Asked whether there had been any progress 
Tuesday, Netanyahu's spokesman, David Bar-Illan, said, ``Nothing, 
nothing, nothing.'' Netanyahu himself said, ``I wouldn't say we are 
at square one, but we are certainly not at the end of the process.'' 
Even the decided issues remain open. Netanyahu, for instance, has 
agreed to turn over another 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians, 
but the wording of the agreement is still being hammered out in a 
delicate process where ``words matter,'' Rubin said. The key outstanding 
issue, though, is the negotiation of an institutionalized, cooperative 
mechanism for cracking down on terrorism. Netanyahu claims that this 
is the Palestinians' obligation, demanding that they dismantle terrorist 
cells, extradite 36 wanted terrorists, including 13 whom the Israelis 
say are working as Palestinian police officers, and confiscate illegal 
weapons. In a statement that offended some Palestinian officials because 
it seemed to echo Netanyahu, Albright Tuesday called a deal on security 
issues ``the sine qua non'' of the overall agreement. The Palestinians 
believe that the turnover of land is the essence of an accord. But 
Albright went on to say that action needed to be taken by both sides, 
and a senior State Department official suggested that the Israelis 
willfully overestimate Arafat's ability to put a halt to terrorism. 
The Palestinians, too, have security demands. They want the Israelis 
to disarm radical Jewish settlers and to stop provoking confrontations 
by expanding Jewish settlements in Palestinian areas. In a move that 
greatly angered them, Netanyahu, in a meeting after his session with 
Albright, agreed to build permanent homes for Jewish settlers who 
now live in a trailer park in the divided city of Hebron. He promised 
to do so after an elderly rabbi was killed there in late August. Declining 
to comment on this move specifically, Albright condemned ``unilateral 
actions that complicate the issues that we are trying to deal with 
here.''
