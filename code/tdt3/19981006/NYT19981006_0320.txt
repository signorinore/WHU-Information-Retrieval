The European Parliament Tuesday lifted the immunity of Jean-Marie 
Le Pen, the leader of France's far-right National Front, allowing 
a German prosecutor to open a criminal investigation against him on 
a charge of belittling the Holocaust. The district attorney in Munich 
asked for a waiver of parliamentary immunity after Le Pen, a member 
of the European Parliament, said in Munich last December that the 
gas chambers in Nazi concentration camps were ``a detail in the history 
of the Second World War.'' A French court later required him to pay 
to retract the statement in French newspapers that had quoted the 
remarks. Le Pen denounced Tuesday's 420-20 vote against him at a session 
of the European Union's parliamentary assembly in Strasbourg. ``Let 
us not forget that I am the victim,'' he said afterward. ``It wasn't 
I who invented the concentration camps, but the fathers, grandfathers 
and uncles of my German colleagues here.'' Le Pen denies that he is 
anti-Semitic, but he has called the gas chambers a detail of history 
before, in 1987, and a French court fined him 1.2 million francs, 
about $217,000, for it then. Germany has even stricter laws against 
belittling Nazi crimes or repeating Nazi propaganda. The Munich prosecutor, 
Manfred Wick, said in a telephone interview that he could open a criminal 
investigation on a charge of ``incitement to public disorder or racial 
discrimination'' after he received formal notification that Le Pen's 
immunity had been lifted. If Le Pen is eventually charged and brought 
to trial, Wick said, he could face a fine and up to five years' imprisonment 
if convicted. Asked in Strasbourg if he would obey a summons to go 
to Munich to testify, Le Pen answered derisively. ``My condition is 
that they guarantee I will not immediately be sent to Dachau or Buchenwald,'' 
he said, referring to the concentration camps Hitler built outside 
Munich and near Weimar. In debate in the Parliament on Monday, Le 
Pen said, ``If these comments have been interpreted in a way that 
made sincere people suffer, I'm sorry.'' Le Pen, who won 15 percent 
of the vote in a campaign for the presidency of France in 1995, is 
a 70-year-old veteran of the French colonial war in Algeria who founded 
his party, the National Front in 1972. Until he was convicted of assaulting 
a Socialist politician who was running against his daughter at a campaign 
rally during last year's French legislative elections, he expected 
to head the National Front's campaign for the European Parliament 
election in June 1999. But a court in Versailles fined him 23,000 
francs, or $4,150, gave him a suspended three-month jail term, and 
deprived him of his civil rights, barring Le Pen of running for office 
for two years. If an appeals court upholds the conviction next month, 
Le Pen has insisted that his wife, Jeanne-Marie, should head the National 
Front ticket for him. The party platform denounces the decline of 
national sovereignty in the European Union and demands the expulsion 
of millions of immigrants from Africa and Asia. Mrs. Le Pen declined 
at first, saying she had never had anything to do with politics and 
did not want to start now. Le Pen's deputy, Bruno Megret, who is eager 
to give the National Front a more moderate image, then said he thought 
he should step in and head the ticket, but Le Pen swatted him down. 
``The president decides and leads the ticket,'' he said. ``There is 
no reason for this to change.'' Megret has said he will take the issue 
to the National Front's membership if Le Pen is barred from running. 
Both men were among the 11 National Front candidates who won seats 
in the 626-member European Parliament in the last elections in 1994.
