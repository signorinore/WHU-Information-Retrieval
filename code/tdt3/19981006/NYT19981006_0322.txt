In his season of pre-holiday hype, every toy maker likes to promote 
its newest plaything as the next Tickle Me Elmo or Beanie Baby. Tiger 
Electronics Inc., which insists that it really does have this year's 
likely winner in the toy wars, began a campaign recently to introduce 
it: a sweet, if slightly scary-looking, little playmate called Furby. 
The company, based in Vernon Hills, Ill., and best known for electronic 
toys, is betting big on Furby and backing it with a multimillion-dollar 
television campaign. The campaign includes three commercials that 
began running Friday and will continue through the holidays on network 
and cable channels. The spots will run in various time slots, including 
those during such family-oriented fare as Disney shows and programs 
on the Cartoon Channel. To understand Tiger's advertising approach, 
it is important to know that Furby has bug eyes, big ears and major 
attitude. It hit store shelves last week, selling for about $30. It 
has a playful voice, becomes snippy if not enough attention is paid, 
and will even sneeze in your face. So what is all the fuss? Well, 
Furby combines the latest in electronic wizardry and fur to create 
what Tiger hopes will appeal to both the young consumers who could 
not get enough of virtual pets last year, including Tiger's Giga Pets, 
and those who preferred to snuggle up with a pile of Beanies. Furby 
is a fully interactive pet that will react to stimuli and ``communicate'' 
with its owner. It speaks both Furbish, an imaginary language, and 
English, which it learns over time as a child interacts with it. If 
Furby is scared or excited, the eyes pop open and ears shoot up. Furby 
plays games and can learn tricks and will even interact with other 
Furbies, all of whom have their own names. If one Furby yawns or sings, 
for instance, its fur-covered cousins do the same. Tiger's intent 
is to market Furby directly to children long before the holiday shopping 
frenzy begins. The young consumers, after all, will ultimately decide 
whether parents will be scrambling for the last Furby on store shelves 
this year or whether the toy will instead be relegated to the markdown 
aisle come January. To sell youngsters on the toy, Tiger is using 
a 30-second spot and two 15-second spots that bring Furby to life. 
``I think the key message we are trying to communicate in the commercial 
is Furby's personality,'' said Stewart Sims, senior vice president 
for marketing at Tiger. ``Furby speaks for himself. He has his own 
unique language and, I think, interesting and amusing voices, so we 
let Furby do most of the talking.'' Though Tiger declines to say exactly 
how much it is spending to promote Furby because it does not want 
to tip off Mattel and other competitors, ``we think everyone will 
see the commercials,'' Sims said. The spots, which use the tag line 
``you keep amazing me,'' were created by Posnick &AMP; Kolker in New 
York, the agency whose ads introduced Cabbage Patch dolls. Posnick 
&AMP; Kolker also created the spots for Tiger's best-selling Giga 
Pets. In the Furby commercials, the toy delights a group of youngsters 
by batting its blue eyes, blurting out Furbish and saying such things 
as ``me love you'' in English. Posnick &AMP; Kolker also tries to 
get across the idea that as with Beanies owning more than one Furby 
can be fun. The commercials show several Furbies interacting with 
one another and the young actors and conclude with a girl surrounded 
by a pack of giggling, furry friends. Typically, toys appeal to children 
in a narrow age range, such as preschoolers or pre-teen-agers. And 
plush toys generally appeal mostly to girls. In recent years, however, 
toy makers have broken through gender and age barriers with such hits 
as virtual pets and Beanie Babies. Those popular playthings proved 
that toys can appeal to boys and girls and to elementary school youngsters 
as well as children of middle-school age. Tiger and Posnick &AMP; 
Kolker are hoping for te same success with Furby. The advertising, 
therefore, had to address different audiences of young people while 
also solving the issue of how to communicate the toy's range in a 
way that did not make children's eyes gloss over. ``The biggest challenge 
probably with Furbies was trying to decide on the balance between 
the combination of soft, cuddly plush toy and the technology aspect,'' 
said Paul Posnick, executive creative director for Posnick &AMP; Kolker. 
``There aren't too many toys that successfully combine this.'' So, 
the creative team decided to show the technology in action by showing 
Furby in action. ``Most kids in advertising don't care how something 
works, they just want to know how to have fun with it,'' Posnick said. 
``Clearly, how we treated the combination was going to make it successful 
or not.''
