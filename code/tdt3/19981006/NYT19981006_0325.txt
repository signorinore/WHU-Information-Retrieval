After striking a deal to provide evidence against former Louisiana 
Gov. Edwin Edwards, San Francisco 49ers co-owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. 
pleaded guilty Tuesday to concealing an alleged extortion plot by 
Edwards that involved the licensing of a riverboat casino. Shortly 
before the proceedings began in federal district court here, the 71-year-old 
Edwards _ tanned, silver-haired, unwrinkled, and accompanied by his 
striking 33-year-old wife, Candy _ strode into the courtroom, glad-handed 
with spectators, and took a seat three rows behind DeBartolo. After 
watching the 45-minute hearing, a bent knuckle pressed against his 
lips, Edwards announced to reporters in a descending elevator that 
his longtime friend had become ``the Linda Tripp of Louisiana.'' For 
emphasis, he later added that ``I hope the 49ers lose this Sunday,'' 
when they play the New Orleans Saints. And noting that DeBartolo is 
worth hundreds of millions of dollars, he scoffed at the prosecution's 
contention that he had victimized DeBartolo: ``If I had victimized 
him, I would have done it for a lot more than $400,000.'' That is 
the amount that all sides agree DeBartolo paid to Edwards, in new 
$100 bills, for his services in March 1997. DeBartolo, the 51-year-old 
scion of one of the country's most successful shopping mall developers, 
softly pleaded guilty to one count of misprison of felony, meaning 
that he failed to report what prosecutors characterized as ``extortion 
and fraudulent conduct'' by Edwards. As per the plea agreement, Judge 
John Parker sentenced DeBartolo to two years probation and ordered 
him to pay a $250,000 fine, forfeit the $400,000 he paid to Edwards 
and provide up to $350,000 in restitution that can be claimed by anyone 
injured by the crime. After sentencing, Parker advised DeBartolo that 
his lawyer, Aubrey Harwell, had served him well. ``This criminal justice 
system rewards the fellow who gets to the courthouse quickest,'' the 
judge said. `` And Mr. Harwell has secured you a prime seat on this 
train that seems to be leaving the station. In fact, you may have 
a private car.'' During the hearing, FBI agent Jeffrey Santini testified 
that evidence provided by witnesses and wiretaps showed that Edwards 
and his son, Stephen, had repeatedly sought payments from DeBartolo 
in late 1996 and early 1997. The money, he said, was to insure that 
the state Gaming Board would award the license for its 15th and final 
riverboat casino to a consortium that included DeBartolo. Although 
Edwards left office in January 1996, prosecutors say he still maintained 
influence with the six-member Gaming Board through other elected and 
appointed officials. Santini said that Edwards put DeBartolo ``in 
fear of economic loss relative to the awarding of his joint venture's 
license if he did not pay Edwards substantial sums of money.'' First 
Edwards demanded ``a $50,000 per month sham consulting agreement payable 
to Stephen Edwards and a price per head of each customer aboard the 
riverboat,'' Santini testified. Then he asked for the $400,000 lump 
sum payment ``by stating, in substance, that he must have payment 
of that amount by March 13 or there could be problems with the licensing.'' 
Even after that payment was made, Santini said, the Edwardses ``sent 
DeBartolo yet another proposed retainer agreement for $10,000 per 
month.'' On March 12, 1997, DeBartolo gave Edwards the $400,000 after 
a lunch in California. The next day, the Gaming Board granted the 
casino license to Hollywood Casino Corp., the Dallas company that 
had enlisted DeBartolo as an investor. The board later withdrew the 
license after learning of the federal investigation. In late April, 
federal agents raided Edwards' house and office and seized the $400,000. 
Federal prosecutors called DeBartolo's plea ``a major development'' 
in their efforts to convict the former four-term governor, a flamboyant 
charmer who twice escaped federal convictions on unrelated charges 
in the 1980s. ``I don't think anyone in their right mind would underestimate 
the value and significance of DeBartolo's cooperation,'' said Eddie 
Jordan, the U.S. Attorney in New Orleans and the lead prosecutor in 
the case. But the plea also raises questions about whether DeBartolo 
will ever regain control of his beloved 49ers, the professional football 
club he managed until last December. At that time, he stepped down 
as chairman after prosecutors notified him that he might be indicted. 
The team has been run ever since by DeBartolo's younger sister, Denise 
DeBartolo York, who is chairwoman and chief executive officer of the 
Youngstown, Ohio, real estate firm started by their father. Although 
the National Football League frowns on the ownership of teams by felons, 
DeBartolo said Tuesday that he would immediately ``start the process 
of getting my football team back.'' NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue 
said in a statement Tuesday that DeBartolo's plea agreement was not 
made as part of any arrangement with his office. ``Until our office 
is able to complete a thorough review of today's agreement and related 
matters, I have directed Mr. DeBartolo to continue his current inactive 
status with respect to both the affairs of the 49ers and the NFL,'' 
Tagliabue said. Several league officials and team owners said Tuesday 
that Tagliabue would have broad discretion to fine DeBartolo and suspend 
him from team activities before allowing him to apply for reinstatement.
