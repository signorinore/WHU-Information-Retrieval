A House panel investigating the Teamsters union disclosed internal 
White House documents Tuesday that shed a fuller and harsher light 
on an effort by Harold Ickes, former White House deputy chief of staff, 
to resolve an agricultural labor dispute in California in behalf of 
the union. The new documents are significant because they have surfaced 
at a time when Ickes' truthfulness about his activities with the teamsters 
is the subject of a 90-day Justice Department inquiry that could lead 
to the appointment of an independent prosecutor. Attorney General 
Janet Reno has until December to decide whether to go forward with 
an outside inquiry. Reno is examining Ickes' statements last year 
to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which first investigated 
the matter in its campaign finance investigation. When Ickes was asked 
by Senate investigators what the Clinton administration did regarding 
the strike at the Diamond Walnut Growers cooperative, he replied, 
``Nothing that I know of.'' But on Tuesday the House subcommittee 
on oversight and investigations released a March 6, 1995, memorandum 
by Ickes to Mickey Kantor, who was the U.S. trade representative at 
the time. It said Ickes had met with a group of Teamsters officials 
and wanted to meet with Kantor to persuade him to intervene in behalf 
of striking Teamsters. ``Given the situation I would like to meet 
with you at your very earliest possible convenience to discuss this 
situation,'' Ickes wrote to Kantor. Additional documents released 
Tuesday showed that Ickes did meet with Kantor on March 24, 1995, 
and followed up the meeting with a thank-you letter on March 27, 1995. 
Then, on April 4, 1995, Kantor telephoned William Cuff, the president 
of Diamond Walnut Growers. Ickes' efforts on behalf of the Teamsters 
occurred against the backdrop of White House efforts to rejuvenate 
a relationship that had cooled after the union supported Clinton and 
other Democratic candidates in the 1992 campaign. The Senate inquiry 
found that in the early months of 1995, Ickes considered several specific 
proposals to enlist the Teamsters' support. Rep. Peter Hoekstra, R-Mich., 
said his committee would continue to investigate the Teamsters, including 
the union's activities with the Democratic National Committee and 
its dealings with Charles Ruff, the White House counsel who was hired 
by the union when he was a lawyer in private practice in 1993. On 
Tuesday, Robert Bennett, Ickes' lawyer, dismissed the significance 
of the documents unearthed by the committee. Bennett said Ickes did 
not interpret his meeting with Teamsters officials, his memorandum 
to Kantor or even Kantor's telephone call to Diamond Walnut as ``doing 
anything for the union'' because Clinton officials did not take concrete 
action to pressure the company into settling the strike. At a subcommittee 
hearing Tuesday, Kantor testified that his call to Cuff was nothing 
more than a brief status inquiry. Kantor said he asked ``for an update 
and what are the prospects for settlement.'' Kantor added, ``I considered 
the call benign, part of my job and of no great consequence.'' But 
Cuff testified Tuesday that he never before received a phone call 
from such a high-ranking official. He said the inquiry unsettled him 
enough to report the call officially to his company's board. ``There 
was absolutely no explicit threat,'' Cuff said. ``The only thing I 
would say is that when you get a call from a senior official of the 
administration you have to be concerned.'' He added, ``I figured it 
was part of the ongoing significant effort by the union to try to 
bring us to our knees.''
