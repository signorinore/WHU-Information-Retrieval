After more than 100 years, the AT&AMP;T brand is one of the most recognized 
in the world, a hallmark of corporate stability and might. It is no 
longer enough. Tuesday, for the first time since the AT&AMP;T Corp. 
was founded in 1885, the company introduced a brand that does not 
mention AT&AMP;T: the Lucky Dog Phone Co. Television advertising for 
the ``new'' company began Tuesday in 18 big markets, including New 
York and Los Angeles. Just as the advertisements for Red Dog beer 
do not mention the Miller Brewing Co., which makes it, and those for 
the 10-10-321 phone service do not mention MCI Worldcom Inc., which 
provides it, the Lucky Dog advertisements do not mention AT&AMP;T. 
They do, however, include talking dogs, a $1 million sweepstakes and 
the voice of Joe Lynn Turner, the former lead singer for the rock 
group Deep Purple. In the 1960s, AT&AMP;T sponsored the Bell Telephone 
Hour, a television showcase for classical music. Then again, in the 
1960s AT&AMP;T enjoyed a legal monopoly on the provision of long-distance 
phone service, and its brand was a leading symbol of reliability and 
convenience. Many of today's consumers, particularly the younger ones, 
could hardly care less about AT&AMP;T's legacy; in fact, it may be 
a turnoff. In today's communications marketplace, loyalty is low, 
competition is high, and the last thing any company wants to be is 
staid. So AT&AMP;T has embraced the tools of modern marketers: a ``stealth'' 
brand that hides the identity of the parent company, giveaway gimmicks, 
appeals to youth and even an anti-establishment image. (This summer 
the company sponsored the 95th birthday of Harley-Davidson Inc., the 
motorcycle maker. After all, C. Michael Armstrong, who took over as 
AT&AMP;T's chairman last year, owns two Harleys.) ``There are a set 
of people out there who identify with that young, fun company that 
we wanted to be able to tap into,'' said Howard E. McNally, the AT&AMP;T 
executive who runs the Lucky Dog operation. ``It's not so much that 
we want to be significantly different from AT&AMP;T. We just wanted 
something new and young and fun.'' ``Not to imply that AT&AMP;T can't 
be that,'' he quickly added. But Lucky Dog is more than a departure 
in attitude for AT&AMP;T, which is still the nation's largest communications 
carrier. It demonstrates a recognition that one of the company's crucial 
decisions of the last few years was plain wrong. That is because the 
Lucky Dog advertisements, created by Young &AMP; Rubicam in New York, 
are meant to pitch an AT&AMP;T ``dial around'' service called 10-10-345. 
Though the service will be available to most United States consumers 
today, it will not be available in some rural areas. Dial-around services 
allow consumers to gain access to special calling promotions by dialing 
a code before entering a long-distance number. Someone who normally 
uses the Sprint Corp. for long-distance calls, for instance, can enter 
10-10-321 before dialing a number and that call will then travel over 
the systems of MCI Worldcom. The customer, however, technically remains 
a Sprint customer. In fact, under the stealth brand of Telecom USA, 
the 10-10-321 service has been a big hit for MCI Worldcom, AT&AMP;T's 
biggest rival. John Donoghue, a senior vice president for marketing 
at MCI Worldcom, says that more than 85 percent of 10-10-321 users 
are AT&AMP;T customers. But even when 10-10-321 started taking business 
away from AT&AMP;T after its national debut in early 1997, AT&AMP;T 
maintained that dial-around was a fad that would fade. It did not, 
and dial-around options proliferated. ``We thought it would come and 
go,'' McNally said. ``We understand the market a little bit better 
now.'' AT&AMP;T seems to think it understands the market so well that 
it has unsheathed a new weapon for the telecommunications wars: a 
big sweepstakes. As part of a back-to-school promotion, MCI Worldcom's 
1-800-COLLECT service is giving away 100 compact disks every day to 
one customer picked at random. But Lucky Dog intends to give away 
345 prizes every day _ including airline tickets, cruises and $345 
cash _ plus a $1 million prize in January. Using the service automatically 
enters the user in the sweepstakes. An executive close to Lucky Dog 
said that AT&AMP;T's market research indicated that the cost-sensitive 
consumers who use dial-around services also tend to enjoy sweepstakes. 
The executive also said that the company would never associate a sweepstakes 
with the AT&AMP;T brand. That has some consumer advocates worried. 
``This creates a situation where consumers might sign up just for 
the opportunity to win,'' said Rebecca Sachs, a spokeswoman for the 
Telecommunications Research and Action Center, a nonprofit communications 
research group in Washington. ``We don't advise consumers to sign 
up for programs where there are gimmicks like this involved.'' Chris 
Shimojima, who helped market Diet Pepsi before joining AT&AMP;T four 
years ago and creating the Lucky Dog concept, has a different view. 
``Having an ongoing sweepstakes seemed like a great idea,'' he said, 
``and that would break through the clutter and inculcate the customer 
into using it again.''
