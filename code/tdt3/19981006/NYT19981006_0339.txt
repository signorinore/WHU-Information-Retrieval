Mark McGwire's other legacy _ not that anyone who hits 70 home runs 
needs another one _ could be his casual aside to sportswriters: ``Hey, 
everybody needs therapy!'' He was exaggerating, of course, but the 
message was clear. The guy the nation grew to worship _ the man who 
fought his way to the top from a messy divorce and career setbacks, 
the devoted single father, the surrogate brother to Sammy Sosa and 
the Maris family _ is someone who conquered his demons with the help 
of four years of psychiatry. In a culture where therapists and their 
patients alike are always good for a laugh, a heroic jock's openness 
about his own history may well encourage others who need help to seek 
it out. But not in Washington. There the prevailing attitude remains 
that ``real men don't get on the couch'' _ as a George Bush spokeswoman 
joked during the '92 campaign. Bill Clinton is apparently less embarrassed 
about his cigar _ and surely this is one instance in psychoanalytic 
history when a cigar is not just a cigar _ than he would be about 
seeking counseling from anyone other than the clergy. On the day of 
his prayer-breakfast mea culpa last month, the president's spokesman 
took pains to deny that Clinton was under treatment ``for any psychiatric 
or mental condition'' _ as if this was supposed to be reassuring. 
Washington's fear and ignorance of mental illness has led to private 
local tragedies (the untreated Vincent Foster's suicide) and shoddy 
public policy, which then leads to preventable national tragedies 
(the seriously ill but insufficiently treated Russell Weston Jr.'s 
murderous rampage at the Capitol). And you have to wonder if the Washington 
mental-health learning curve is getting worse. Among the many rights 
of privacy to be abridged in Monicagate can now be added the confidentiality 
between therapists and their patients. The patient in this case is 
Monica Lewinsky, who, not without reason, sought the help of two different 
therapists during her adventures with the two big creeps, Clinton 
and Tripp. As part of the bargain Kenneth Starr drove in his immunity 
negotiations with Lewinsky, she agreed to grant a limited waiver freeing 
both her therapists to corroborate her accounts of presidential sex 
in interviews with his investigators. One of the therapists, Irene 
Kassorla, specifically asked, however, that ``the details of her interview 
not be made public'' _ a doomed, almost poignant, request in our Salem 
of 1998. Both her interview and that of the other therapist, Kathleen 
Estep, became part of the latest Judiciary Committee document dump 
last Friday, with minimal redactions. Since there was no information 
in either interview remotely germane to the investigation that hadn't 
already been summarized in the previously released Starr report and 
documents, there was no need to release the complete interviews; there 
was no previously unmined news in them at all, as witness their scant 
press coverage over the weekend. What was added to the record, though, 
were her therapists' diagnostic speculations about Lewinsky's possible 
clinical ailments and their connection to her ``relationship with 
her father.'' Ho-hum stuff, perhaps, but surely the patient's private 
business and utterly irrelevant to an impeachment investigation. In 
his posthumously published memoir, Arthur Liman, the chief counsel 
in the Iran-contra hearings, recalls that ``suggestions in the press 
that (Oliver) North had undergone psychiatric treatment at a military 
facility'' prompted him to ``subpoena those records.'' But after soul-searching, 
he concluded that North ``was entitled to the same privacy as an ordinary 
citizen.'' Such concern for the niceties of privacy sound absolutely 
quaint now. I wonder if today's Washington would even muster the same 
outrage once provoked by one of the most unsavory incidents of Watergate 
_ the White House ``plumbers'' break-in to the Beverly Hills office 
of Daniel Ellsberg's therapist in a failed effort to burglarize his 
psychiatric files. When the Nixon aide John Ehrlichman was sentenced 
to prison for his role in this incident, the judge, Gerhard Gesell, 
called it ``a shameful episode in the history of this country.'' When 
last Friday Congress blithely released psychiatric musings on a private 
citizen, posting them on a government Web site for all the world to 
see, it was simply business as usual. (BOX)
