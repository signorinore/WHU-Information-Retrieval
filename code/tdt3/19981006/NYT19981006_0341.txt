So I was having a light lunch of sweet potato fries and sour cream 
with a couple of girlfriends. We couldn't trouble ourselves with the 
silly impeachment hearings. All that fake solemnity and pretense of 
openmindedness. Here is Congress, which has boasted more concupiscent 
hypocrites pouncing on more nubile office girls than any institution 
in history except maybe Mitsubishi, and they're ready to string up 
Bill Clinton over sex? We spent our lunch on truly weighty matters, 
like how much we had lost on mutual funds. Things have gotten so bad, 
my stockbroker calls me asking for money, uttering the dread words 
``margin call.'' Where, we fretted, would we ever come up with a pot 
o' cash to finance our new fall wardrobes? Heaven forfend that we 
keep wearing black, now that Seventh Avenue has declared gray the 
new black. Suddenly it dawned on us. Larry Flynt! The publisher of 
Hustler had put a full-page ad in The Washington Post on Sunday offering 
``up to $1 million'' to anyone who could provide documentary evidence 
of ``an adulterous sexual encounter with a current member of the U.S. 
Congress or a high-ranking government official.'' That sounded easy 
enough. We could hunt down some hypocritical official, trap him into 
an encounter, and get the bounty. All we needed to do was follow the 
game plan for snagging powerful, clueless men set out in old Hollywood 
capers like ``How to Marry a Millionaire.'' Or we could just follow 
the man-trap techniques used by Monica Lewinsky to bag the leader 
of the Free World. Her romantic gambits could have come straight out 
of those '50s movies. She is a girl who cries out for Technicolor, 
not black and white. In the 1954 ``Three Coins in the Fountain,'' 
Maggie McNamara's character catches an Italian prince by researching 
his tastes, from wine to opera, and then pretending hers are the same. 
She even feigns a passion for the piccolo. In the 1959 ``Ask Any Girl,'' 
Shirley MacLaine snares Gig Young by stealing his little black book 
and aping his favorite dates. He likes red hair? She dyes hers. He 
likes a certain perfume? She buys it. Monica's seduction methods were 
based on the old-fashioned premise that men (and fish) are attracted 
by bright, shiny objects. She stationed herself, in flashy dresses, 
on rope lines and in the path of the presidential motorcade. She studied 
her prey's preferences in books and accessories, and even called an 
antiquarian bookstore in Annapolis, Md., where the president had browsed, 
to see what he had lingered over. Told it was a book about American 
presidents, she bought it for him. In the 1953 ``How to Marry a Millionaire,'' 
Bacall, Monroe and Grable set their ``bear trap'' _ ``All you need 
is just one big, fat one,'' said Miss Bacall _ by hanging around Bergdorf's 
mink department. Larry Flynt is clearly looking for a deliciously 
high duplicity level. If we wanted that million, we would need a big, 
fat Republican bear. If you want to trap Republicans, you have to 
hang out at the D.C. steak house the Capital Grille, or at Christian 
Coalition rallies. The come-hither lines would have to be issue-oriented. 
Trent Lott would melt if you purred: ``I loved your muscular stance 
on fast track.'' You could bewitch Dick Armey, an economist, with 
sweet nothings about more supply and less demand. And you could sidle 
up to Mitch McConnell and coo, ``Soft money is soooo sexy.'' Naughty 
Newt Gingrich, the thrice-married nut Bob Barr and confessed philanderer 
Henry Hyde didn't pose enough of a challenge. We needed a real shocker. 
We would have to bag someone like...Bill McCollum, the transcendentally 
geeky Florida Republican on the Judiciary Committee who seems to think 
impeachment is too kind and that the president deserves a good jolt 
from Old Sparky. The thought of ``an encounter'' with the bespectacled 
congressman snapped us out of our man-trapping '50s reverie. Bill 
McCollum is no Gig Young. Besides, we already know that Congress is 
the biggest glass house in the world when it comes to misbehavior. 
And it would be a waste of time trying to embarrass the Republicans 
on sex when they are doing such a fine job of embarrassing themselves.
