Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reported an unexpected return to profitability 
in its third quarter Tuesday, helped by strong sales of the company's 
K6-2 microprocessor. It was the second chip company to provide an 
unanticipated bit of good news about earnings, a possible sign of 
a rebound in the chip industry. Motorola Inc. reported better-than-expected 
earnings Monday. Advanced Micro officials said the K6-2, which offers 
similar performance to Intel Corp.'s Pentium chips but at a lower 
price, was being used in the majority of personal computers selling 
for under $1,000. They said PC manufacturers appeared to have worked 
through an inventory glut, which had depressed microprocessor sales 
in previous quarters. Sales of non-microprocessor products were flat, 
they said. Advanced Micro, which had not expected to make money in 
the quarter, reported results after the close of the market. Advanced 
Micro shares closed at $19.88, up $1.50, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Motorola shares also rose Tuesday after the company said late Monday 
that chip sales would rise next year and that it was on track to meet 
fourth-quarter earnings estimates. Motorola said it expected chip 
sales to increase 7 percent to 9 percent worldwide in 1999, compared 
with an 11 percent drop in 1998. Mark Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan 
Stanley, said the positive reports from Advanced Micro and Motorola 
were evidence of a turnaround in the chip industry, particularly for 
those companies that supply personal computer manufacturers. ``Motorola 
reported orders up 5 percent from the previous quarter,'' he said. 
``Motorola has not reported sequential order growth in the third quarter 
in any other year this decade.'' For AMD's third quarter, which ended 
Sept. 27, the company earned $1 million, or 1 cent a diluted share, 
compared with a loss of $31.7 million in the comparable period a year 
ago. Sales increased 15 percent, to $685.9 million, from $596.6 million 
in the third quarter of 1997. Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. 
had expected Advanced Micro to post a loss of 11 cents a share. ``We're 
seeing a strengthening of the market worldwide in PCs,'' said AMD 
chairman and chief executive W.J. Sanders in a telephone conference 
call with securities analysts. ``The worst is behind us. We're gaining 
market share because of the superior technology we have.'' Sanders 
quoted a report by PC Data, a market research firm in Reston, Va., 
which said systems powered by AMD-K6 family processors captured 31 
percent of the total U.S. retail market for desktop systems in August, 
the latest period for which data were available. In the rapidly growing 
market for sub-$1,000 systems, PCs powered by AMD-K6 family processors 
captured a 54 percent market share, the highest penetration the company 
has yet achieved. Edelstone said that on a global basis, Advanced 
Micro's share of the total microprocessor market was in the low teens, 
and that the company shipped about 4 million microprocessors in the 
quarter, compared with about 23 million for Intel. But he said Advanced 
Micro had gained share and would continue to do so at least in the 
near future. ``We think they will continue to take share in the fourth 
quarter,'' he said. ``Then the question is will they have the necessary 
infrastructure,'' to support new products in 1999. AMD also said Tuesday 
that Sony Corp. planned to use its K6-2 microprocessor in new Vaio 
computers to be introduced later this month in Japan. The new Sony 
Vaio Combo will feature the K6-2 350 megahertz processor that has 
enhanced audio and video technology, Advanced Micro said. It is the 
first time Sony has used an Advanced Micro K6 chip.
