Stocks were mixed Tuesday in a volatile session as the technology-heavy 
Nasdaq declined for a second consecutive day. Traders and analysts 
said investors remain nervous about a number of outstanding issues 
threatening the global and domestic economy, and are using brief rallies 
as an opportunity to sell shares. Stocks looked like they might be 
poised for a strong rally, because many of the elements that previously 
might have triggered waves of buying were evident early in the session: 
a strong performance on foreign equity markets and better-than-expected 
third-quarter earnings reports from Aluminum Company of America and 
Motorola, two big, globally-oriented companies. Those factors did 
in fact propel prices higher in the early hours; at one point the 
Dow Jones industrial average was up 154 points and the Nasdaq composite 
index was up 40 points. While the Dow managed to generate a small 
gain, broader indexes registered declines, especially the Nasdaq. 
The Dow rose 16.74 points, or 0.22 percent, to 7,742.98. But the Standard 
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.97 points, or 0.4 percent, to 
984.59. The Nasdaq composite index declined 25.80, or 1.68 percent, 
to 1,510.89. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks dropped 4.25 
points, or 1.26 percent, to 332.55, its ninth consecutive loss. ``The 
market is nervous,'' said Alan Ackerman, an executive vice president 
at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ``We are looking at continuing fear of a world 
recession, and an erosion of confidence that it can be staved off. 
Growth is slowing in world markets, and needs to be stimulated.'' 
Technology shares bore the brunt of the concern about a global economic 
downturn and weakening earnings, as high-profile, market-moving names 
like Cisco Systems, Microsoft and Intel were battered again. ``The 
technology stocks are discounting the possibility of a global recessionary 
environment in 1999,'' said Michael Molnar, a managing director in 
sales and trading at Salomon Smith Barney. ``The mind-set that people 
have is to sell any strength in technology, and the most vulnerable 
stocks are the ones with maximum global exposure.'' Cisco fell 2[, 
to 46 3/16; Microsoft dropped 3 9/16, to 97|, and Intel lost 15/16, 
to 79|. Motorola, which released third-quarter earnings that were 
better than expected after the market closed Monday, was an exception, 
rising 3\, to 41 13/16. Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminum producer, 
was the catalyst behind the rise in the Dow Jones industrial average. 
Its shares jumped 4 5/16, to 72{, after its earnings exceeded analysts' 
expectations. The company said that cost-cutting had helped to offset 
lower metals prices. Wal-Mart Stores reported better-than-expected 
sales gains for September and said that it intends to open, remodel 
or relocate as many as 426 stores next year. Shares of Wal-Mart gained 
2\, to 59{. Some other big retailers also rallied. Dayton Hudson rose 
1 7/16, to 35 13/16, and Sears, Roebuck gained 1 3/16, to 43}. Financial 
services stocks, however, continued to be beat up. J.P. Morgan &AMP; 
Co. fell ~, to 79. Citicorp lost 1, to 85 and Merrill Lynch lost 1, 
to 41 15/16. ``The financial sector is usually a market leader at 
both tops and bottoms,'' said Gail Dudack, chief investment strategist 
at UBS Securities. ``I haven't seen them turn yet, and that makes 
me nervous. I will need to see the whole financial sector sort of 
stabilize before I change my view that we are out of a bear market.''
