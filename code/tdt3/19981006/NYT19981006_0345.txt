Bond prices ended lower Tuesday for the first time in six trading 
sessions, reflecting some gains in battered overseas stock markets 
that diminished demand for Treasury securities as a safe haven investment. 
The 30-year bond fell 8/32, to a price of 112 7/32. The bond's yield, 
which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.73 
percent from its 12-year low of 4.72 percent Monday. After the enormous 
gains over the last few weeks in the bond market as investors sought 
a safe-haven from tumbling stocks, analysts said it was understandable 
to see a pullback. Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director 
of fixed income at the J.W. Genesis Financial Corp. in Boca Raton, 
Fla., said bond prices have risen so quickly and yields fallen so 
much that the market is now vulnerable to sudden sell-offs. ``Investors 
realize that we are at very lofty prices levels,'' he said. ``With 
the government long bond yielding in the neighborhood of 4.70 percent, 
the market is susceptible to any kind of negative news.''
