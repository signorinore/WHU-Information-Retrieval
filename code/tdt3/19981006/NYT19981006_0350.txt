The largest single gift to an American business school _ $50 million 
to the College of Business Administration of the University of Arkansas 
_ was announced Tuesday by the Walton Family Charitable Support Foundation 
at a ceremony at the university's Fayetteville campus. The foundation, 
which was created in 1987 by Sam Walton and his wife, Helen, supports 
charitable organizations like the University of Arkansas. Walton, 
who died in 1992, was the founder of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. He graduated 
from the University of Missouri at Columbia in 1940 with a degree 
in business. Other major gifts to business schools, according to the 
American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business, include $40 
million to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania earlier 
this year; $35 million to the Gordon S. Marshall School of Business 
at the University of Southern California in 1997; and $33.5 million 
to the Owen Graduate School of Management of Vanderbilt University, 
also in 1997. The Arkansas gift also ranks as one of the 40 largest 
gifts to higher education since 1967, according to the Chronicle of 
Higher Education, a weekly publication serving colleges and universities. 
Emory University tops that list as the recipient of $295 million in 
1996. Doyle Williams, dean of the College of Business Administration, 
said that after being used to increase the school's endowment, the 
money would in large part go to retaining and attracting faculty members 
of national stature. ``At present,'' Williams said, ``our School of 
Business, which has approximately 2,600 undergraduates, is ranked 
in the third tier, and our M.B.A. program, which serves about 150 
master's students, is among the top 100 in the nation. This gift will 
catapult the college into the highest rank. Within five years, we 
will be among the top 25 schools of business.'' After the ceremony, 
S. Robson Walton, chairman of Wal-Mart Stores and Sam Walton's eldest 
son, said: ``As a young man Dad's dream had been to go to the Wharton 
School at the University of Pennsylvania, but that was in the 1930s 
and he couldn't afford it. But he certainly recognized how going to 
an outstanding business school could give anyone a leg up, and he 
would be pleased by our making this gift.'' University of Arkansas 
chancellor John A. White said he would recommend to the university 
trustees that the business school be renamed the Sam M. Walton College 
of Business Administration. The trustees are expected to act on the 
proposal next month. With the $50 million gift, Walton family contributions 
to the University of Arkansas come close to $64 million for a wide 
variety of programs, including two endowed faculty chairs, the Sam 
M. Walton Leadership Chair in the College of Business Administration 
and the Wal-Mart Chair in Marketing; the Walton Family African-American 
Future Educator conference; the Great Expectations of Arkansas Program, 
and the Helen Robson Walton Reading Room in Mullins Library.
