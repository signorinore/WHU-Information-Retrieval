Jerome Weidman, the prolific and popular novelist who wrote ``I Can 
Get It for You Wholesale'' and also won a Pulitzer Prize as the author 
(with George Abbott) of the Broadway musical ``Fiorello!,'' died Tuesday 
at his home in Manhattan. He was 85. In his two prosperous careers 
as novelist and playwright, Weidman often wrote about the rough underside 
of business and politics _ and daily life _ in New York, the city 
where he was born. His first novel, ``I Can Get It for You Wholesale,'' 
published in 1937 when he was 24, teemed with the life in Manhattan's 
garment center, telling about the rise of the ragingly ambitious Harry 
Bogen. Along with the title character in Budd Schulberg's ``What Makes 
Sammy Run?,'' Harry became an archetypal figure in American literature: 
the abrasive young man who would do anything to get ahead. Weidman 
wrote 22 novels, many volumes of short stories, several plays and 
screenplays and, in 1986, a memoir, ``Praying for Rain.'' ``Wholesale'' 
was a striking debut. The reviewer in The New York Times said that 
the author ``knows his subject about as well as Ernest Hemingway knew 
the Paris cafes, James M. Cain the postman who always rang twice, 
John O'Hara the life and death of Julian English.'' The novel made 
his reputation and became his longest running success. Transformed 
into a Broadway musical in 1962 (with a score by Harold Rome), it 
starred Elliott Gould as Harry Bogen, and was the show in which Barbra 
Streisand made her Broadway debut (as the secretary Miss Marmelstein). 
``Wholesale'' was also the source of a 1951 movie, which retained 
very little of the book except for its title and gave Susan Hayward 
the central role as a female version of Harry Bogen. The book was 
followed by an equally hard-driving sequel, ``What's In It for Me?'' 
The musical ``Wholesale'' came after ``Fiorello!'' and ``Tenderloin,'' 
both with book by Weidman and score by Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick. 
In addition to winning the Pulitzer Prize, ``Fiorello!'' _ a musical 
about Mayor La Guardia of New York _ won a New York Drama Critics 
Circle award as best musical of the 1959-60 season and tied with ``The 
Sound of Music'' for a Tony award that season. Weidman's first novel 
became the hallmark of his career, and also a subject of controversy. 
There were those like Meyer Levin who thought of him, along with Schulberg, 
as examples of ``the self-hating period in writing,'' as novelists 
who wrote too negatively about their Jewish backgrounds. ``The novelist 
is not a propagandist,'' said Weidman in an interview in 1978 with 
Richard F. Shepard in The Times. ``I have lived all my life with Jewish 
people, and I have to paint them, warts and all. My beat is the beat 
that Sinclair Lewis took, life in America.'' He added: ``I admit that 
some of the people I write about are not of the most estimable character. 
I am never apologetic about it.'' His was an insider's report on life 
as he saw it. Weidman said that Hemingway thought of him as the American 
Balzac, and wrote, in a letter, ``Don't let them get you down, kid, 
because I think you can write just a little better than anybody else 
that's around.'' For the next five decades, Weidman continued to write 
his novels and stories. Though his literary reputation wavered, and 
some critics felt that he had written his best work at the beginning 
of his career, he retained his audience. Many of his books were best 
sellers. The author responded philosophically to adverse criticism. 
Commenting on ``the number of geniuses that flared and faded'' in 
his time, he was proud of his ability to survive as a writer and to 
be continually productive. His claim was more that of an entertainer 
and an artisan. As he said: ``I know how to handle my bag of tools. 
I can write a story about anything under the sun.'' To some, his stories, 
along with ``Wholesale,'' were at the core of his career. Reviewing 
one collection, a Times critic wrote of the book's ``savage brilliance'' 
and called it a ``splendid exhibition of Weidman's work.'' The fiction 
was often drawn from the life of the author. Before he wrote ``Wholesale,'' 
he worked in the garment district, and ``The Enemy Camp,'' which was 
about anti-Semitism in suburbia, paralleled his own life, as a New 
York Jew who moved with his family to Connecticut. Reviewing ``Before 
You Go'' in The Times in 1960, Charles Poore said this novel about 
World War II was ``bound to be one of the outstanding successes of 
the year,'' and added it that it was ``about passion, ambition, heartbreak 
and revenge'' and ``traces the rise in New York's mean streets to 
glamorous toughness on the world's high, mysterious peaks of decision.'' 
Except for the mysterious peaks, something like this could have been 
said about many other Weidman novels. Weidman was born on April 14, 
1913, on the Lower East Side, a son of immigrant parents. After he 
graduated from De Witt Clinton High School, he moved with his family 
to the Bronx and took a job as an office boy in the garment district, 
where he immediately began gathering material. Later he studied at 
City College of New York. At 17, he sold his first story, to the American 
Spectator. He soon had stories in Story, The American Mercury and 
The New Yorker, where 23 of his stories appeared between 1936 and 
1946. While studying at New York University Law School, Weidman wrote 
his first novel, which he called ``Ten O'Clock Scholar.'' After many 
rejections, it was published as ``I Can Get It for You Wholesale.'' 
Weidman quickly followed it with its sequel. In 1939, Alfred Kazin 
reviewed Weidman's first collection of stories in The Times, calling 
the book ``a snarling, joyous, rambunctious carload of sound effects 
in the best Seventh Avenue New Yorkese.'' Among Weidman's other novels 
were ``The Third Angel,'' ``The Enemy Camp,'' ``Before You Go,'' ``The 
Sound of Bow Bells,'' ``Other People's Money,'' ``The Temple,'' ``A 
Family Fortune'' and ``Counselors-at-Law.'' The prize-winning ``Fiorello!'' 
added a new dimension to his career. In addition to ``Tenderloin'' 
and ``Wholesale,'' he wrote the book for Duke Ellington's ``Pousse-Cafe'' 
and a Broadway comedy, ``The Mother Lover.'' He is survived by his 
wife, Peggy of Manhattan; two sons, John of Manhattan, and Jeffrey 
of Kansas City, Mo., and two grandchildren. John Weidman is the author 
of the books for two Stephen Sondheim musicals, ``Pacific Overtures'' 
and ``Assassins.'' In his memoir, Weidman looked back on his beginnings 
as a New Yorker and as a writer: ``Living as part of the sweaty traffic 
of New York's East River docks in the early part of this century was 
for me a time of excitement I did not think about, much less understand.'' 
It was not until he read Mark Twain that he realized he could be a 
writer. As he said: ``Life for me on East Fourth Street when I was 
a boy was not unlike what life on the banks of the Mississippi had 
been for young Sam Clemens of Hannibal, Mo. Guileless, untrained and 
unself-conscious, I put the stories down on paper the way I learned 
to walk.'' Soon he was running.
