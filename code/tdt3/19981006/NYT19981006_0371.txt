No one said as much, but ``My So-Called Life'' was probably done for 
from the beginning. ``The first sign of trouble was the reception 
the network gave the pilot when we turned it in,'' recalled Marshall 
Herskovitz, one of its producers. ``Very mixed.'' In that initial 
episode, in 1994, an edgy, questioning 15-year-old named Angela Chase, 
played with a nicely dark naturalness by Claire Danes, dyes her hair 
red and says she can't look at her mother without wanting to stab 
her repeatedly. Fans of the show quickly took to Angela's cogent assessments 
of family, life and love. But ABC remained ambivalent, and low ratings 
were the clincher. With a rabid following growing slowly and its producers 
protesting heatedly, the series expired after 19 episodes. As they 
say, the good die young. But in television the good can sometimes 
enjoy an afterlife, and so it is with ``My So-Called Life'': six hourlong 
episodes (including the pilot) will be released on video on Tuesday 
by BMG. Critics weren't universally in love with the series, but most 
acknowledged its realism and strong individual voice. Nineteen episodes 
weren't enough, however. ``The show never got a rhythm that allowed 
people to get into it,'' Herskovitz said. ``It was kind of doomed 
in that way.'' Two weeks ago he and the director Ed Zwick, his partner 
in Bedford Falls, a production company, made news by striking a pioneering 
development deal with ABC and Fox. In return for relinquishing huge 
up-front payments for series they produce in the future, they will 
gain a share of the shows' revenues. That might have paid off handsomely 
in the case of ``Thirtysomething,'' another Herskovitz-Zwick collaboration. 
It would not have been the way to go with ``My So-Called Life.'' In 
terms of target audience, the series was about two years early. ``We 
created a show whose major constituency was teen-age girls,'' Herskovitz 
said. That wasn't exactly a crime, but until Ms. Danes and Leonardo 
DiCaprio came along in the film ``Romeo and Juliet'' (1996) and young 
girls flocked to a slasher movie called ``Scream,'' the networks didn't 
regard the female half of the teen-age population as an audience worth 
pursuing. ``Now they're this huge economic force,'' he said. Ms. Danes 
had just turned 14 when the series was made. Angela is as much a wily 
and honest observer as she is a confused and insecure teen-ager. ``Sometimes 
it feels like we're living in some kind of prison,'' she says in an 
episode about looks, ``and the crime is that we hate ourselves.'' 
On another occasion she ruffles a teacher and classmates by saying 
she kind of envied Anne Frank in the attic because at least she was 
cooped up with a boy she liked. ``I wanted everybody to meet this 
real person who happened to be 15,'' said Winnie Holzman, who was 
the primary writer on the show. Ms. Holzman had worked for Herskovitz 
and Zwick on ``Thirtysomething.'' The idea for ``My So-Called Life'' 
was theirs; the characterizations were largely hers. Angela's mother 
(Bess Armstrong) is a hand-wringing fuss-budget, an obsessive worrier 
and controller. Her father (Tom Irwin) is an affably ineffectual sort 
who should have gone to cooking school and become a chef but instead 
works for his wife as a printing salesman and ducks issues and confrontations 
by saying that he's not entitled to tell Angela what to do or how 
to think. Though uncertain on many matters, Angela does her own thinking. 
Honesty was paramount. ``We pitched it that way to ABC,'' Ms. Holzman 
said. ``When you tell the networks you're going to be honest, they 
nod and smile, but they really don't believe you.'' No one said no 
to the pilot. No one said anything. ``They couldn't say no yet because 
the show had this undeniable gripping quality,'' Ms. Holzman said. 
``Claire was so charismatic, so much a star right from the get-go, 
it was hard to turn away and say no. But at the same time they thought 
it was all terribly odd.'' It would take ABC a year to order further 
episodes. Content per se wasn't the problem. ``The main thing was 
that they had no idea who would watch the show,'' Herskovitz said. 
``They didn't think adults would watch it and they didn't think the 
kid audience was very valuable at all.'' Placed opposite ``Friends'' 
(in its first season) on Thursday nights, ``My So-Called Life'' never 
surfaced with a large general audience. As it turned out, the show 
caught hold with segments both young and adult. ``If you were 15 or 
30, you could watch it on your own terms,'' Ms. Holzman said. ``I 
think adults got a lot about the show younger people couldn't get.'' 
Did ABC quit on it too soon? ``Seinfeld'' took a while to build an 
audience So did ``Cheers'' and ``Thirtysomething.'' In the case of 
``My So-Called Life,'' Ms. Holzman said, ``you knew it would have 
grown if they had left it on the air _ kind of a duh, I thought.''
