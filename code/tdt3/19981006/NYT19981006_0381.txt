In Paul Davis' theater posters, one can see the essence of the original 
performance: the arrogant charm of Raul Julia's Mack the Knife in 
``Threepenny Opera,'' Sam Waterston crying out his rage in ``Hamlet,'' 
the Orientalized elegance of Irene Worth in ``The Cherry Orchard'' 
and the full range of Kevin Kline's virtuosity as Hamlet, Richard 
III and the Pirate King in ``The Pirates of Penzance. As an artist, 
Davis made his reputation with these posters and others he drew for 
Joseph Papp during the heyday of the New York Shakespeare Festival 
in the 1970s and 1980s. Sitting in his East Village studio, surrounded 
by examples of his work, he recalled a Papp prediction: ``He said 
that someday all that will be left of these plays will be the posters.'' 
Although those portraits remain at the core of his art, Davis has 
produced an astonishing variety of work, political as well as theatrical 
and cinematic, including covers for news magazine and books, murals 
and advertising layouts. A hearty sampling from all stages of his 
40-year career is on exhibit through Oct. 30 at the School of Visual 
Arts (209 E. 23rd St). The pictures in the exhibition, about 200 items 
drawn from the collection of Davis and his family, include figure 
drawings he made during his residency last year in Italy as a Prix 
de Rome winner. They are, of course, signed with his distinctive, 
carefully curlicued signature. Davis, a graduate of Visual Arts, is 
an instructor at the school and, at 60, is this year's recipient of 
its Master Series Award. Whenever possible, Davis has drawn from life. 
Kline, the most frequent subject of Davis pictures, would come to 
his studio and perform scenes from the plays while the artist photographed 
him in action. Then, using the photographs as a guide, Davis made 
his drawings. Sometimes he has had to work at a distance, especially 
when doing political figures. Naturally, Che Guevera did not pose 
for Davis' posthumous portrait. When Davis drew Nelson Mandela for 
a Time magazine cover, the subject was still in prison; Davis had 
to draw from old photographs and from Winnie Mandela's description. 
She would tell him things like ``he has pain in his eyes.'' How did 
he paint pain? Through instinct and with painterly technique. Although 
he has done still lifes and landscapes, like a 70-foot mural of the 
seasons for the Arcadia restaurant on the Upper East Side (removed 
after the restaurant's recent closing), he specializes in portraits 
of people. He has been drawing faces since he was a child in Tulsa, 
Okla. The title of his 1985 book was ``Faces,'' the faces ranging 
from Papp as a swaggering song and dance man (with cigar) to early 
portraits of the Kennedy brothers, looking extraordinarily youthful 
_ and thoughtful. One key to his portraits is in the eyes. A face, 
he said, can be immobile, but you can see ``the life of a person through 
their eyes.'' Often, as in his painting of Laurence Olivier as King 
Lear, the eyes have a searing intensity, as if the actor were staring 
right through the viewer of the picture. Or in the case of Jack Nicholson, 
the eyes signal mischief. In contrast to artists like Al Hirschfeld 
who work with line, Davis paints in color with brush strokes. ``I 
always felt the need for light and shade,'' said. He describes his 
work as ``illusionistic,'' and it is filled with allegories and symbolism 
_ the Rolling Stones as stones rolling down a hill; Darryl F. Zanuck 
as the logo of 20th Century Fox, with starlets in his sunglasses and 
a dollar sign in his cigar smoke. ``It was Picasso who said most good 
portraits have a lot of caricature in them,'' Davis recalled. ``You're 
trying to represent people, but you're also trying to enlarge on those 
aspects that make them more like themselves.'' From his perspective, 
``A true poster is meant for the street,'' he said. ``The whole point 
is to get somebody to do something _ a call for action.'' By definition 
it is political. A theater poster is intended to sell tickets, an 
advertising poster is intended to sell a product, and ``a political 
poster is supposed to make you aware of an issue or a candidate.'' 
At the same time, in the right hands the poster is, of course, an 
individual work of art, which is one reason Davis shies from being 
called an illustrator. As he said: ``Illustrations are made to accompany 
something _ a text. A lot of the work I've done is meant to stand 
on its own, as itself.'' Similarly, he objects to the distinction 
made between high and low art. He prefers to make distinctions between 
good and bad art. That difference is not always accurately defined 
by those who commission the art. Some of his strongest pictures have 
been rejected by magazines for various editorial reasons. He is undeterred 
by that fact: he has the portrait to show for it _ and also a healthy 
fee. Davis also sells his drawings for around $1,500, his paintings 
for as much as $40,000. Occasionally he does private portraits on 
commission. Although he has galleries handling his work in other countries 
_ two in Japan and one in Italy _ he is not represented in New York. 
He handles his own sales, and his work sells well. With enthusiasm, 
he often paints on surfaces other than canvas: his Ralph Nader is 
on a shopping bag, Dr. Spock on a baby bottle, both Madonna and Ronald 
Reagan on blocks of woods. Wood, in fact, is one of Davis' favorite 
surfaces. ``It's hard, but it absorbs the paint,'' he said. He concedes 
that women are more difficult to paint than men. ``Sharp edges are 
easier to paint than soft edges,'' he said. ``Craggy is easier to 
do. I've always tried to paint beautiful women.'' In a book that describes 
25 outstanding American illustrators, he lists more than 50 people 
who had a great effect on his work. The list includes ``Miss Ownby,'' 
his eighth-grade art teacher in Oklahoma; Silas Rhodes, the head of 
the School of Visual Arts, which he attended on a scholarship; Milton 
Glaser and Seymour Chwast, who gave him his first job at their Pushpin 
studio, enabling him to paint rather than having to support himself 
by teaching. As he said, ``First you succeed, then you teach.'' Also 
in the pantheon are Marcel Duchamp (the influence of Surrealism), 
Mark Twain, several Japanese painters, Balthus and Giotto (his two 
favorite artists) and Walt Kelly, the creator of Pogo. Explaining 
his fondness for Kelly, Davis said he had started out wanting to be 
a cartoonist. ``If I could have been Walt Kelly or Al Capp or Chester 
Gould, I would have been delighted,'' he said. ``But I had to settle 
for something else.'' Cartooning appeals to the storytelling side 
of his art. Despite the apparent pictorial realism of his work, it 
is, he said, ``more fanciful than a photograph,'' In his spare time, 
he still occasionally tries to draw cartoons and has become an expert 
at computer animation, examples of which can be seen in the exhibition. 
Calling up one of his abstract shorts on a computer screen, he demonstrated 
the transformative power of this process. Suddenly a Paul Davis cartoon 
morphed into a Picasso _ and then just as quickly returned to a Davis, 
and seemed to dance around the screen. It was the animation equivalent 
of a jazz improvisation, adding an extra dimension to the artist's 
visceral sense of theater.
