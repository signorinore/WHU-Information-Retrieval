As President Clinton argued anew Tuesday that ``we must find a way 
to temper the volatile swings of the international marketplace,'' 
the president of the World Bank publicly broke with the approach that 
the United States and the International Monetary Fund have taken in 
managing the global crisis. In a speech to the finance ministers and 
central bank governors from 182 nations meeting in Washington, World 
Bank president James Wolfensohn said that in the rush to stabilize 
currencies and bring about economic reform, too little attention was 
being paid to the growing ranks of unemployed and the risks of undercutting 
political stability. ``The poor cannot wait on our deliberations,'' 
he said. Wolfensohn's warnings underscored the extraordinary dissension 
and disagreements at this year's meetings of the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund over whether the strategy for stopping 
the global turmoil has been misguided. While the fund and bank often 
disagree privately, Tuesday's speech brought into the open months 
of tension between the two sister institutions over the right strategy 
for dealing with the crisis. The tension is so great that Treasury 
Secretary Robert Rubin said Tuesday that the two huge institutions 
must to settle their many differences. Little progress was made Tuesday 
on forging short-term solutions. President Clinton, in his second 
speech on the world economic crisis in two days, repeated his proposal 
that the major nations of the world set up a ``precautionary lines 
of credit'' that would help countries that are taking the needed tough 
economic steps but nonetheless are caught up in the wave of financial 
turmoil. The Clinton administration also said Tuesday that it was 
holding preliminary discussions to schedule an emergency economic 
summit meeting in London next month, as suggested by British Prime 
Minister Tony Blair. The meeting, if it takes place, is intended to 
follow up on some of the few concrete recommendations to have emerged 
from this meeting. There is clear consensus for one: a series of global 
rules on ``transparency,'' requiring countries to make public reports 
of far more information about their foreign currency reserves and 
other data that would tip off investors that trouble might be brewing. 
There is far more dispute, however, over whether those rules would 
also apply to private entities, especially hedge funds, the huge investment 
pools that are blamed by many for exacerbating the crisis with huge 
bets on the currencies of small countries. Nor is there agreement 
yet on rules that would force big lenders _ banks and other investors 
_ to pay a far greater share of the burden of bailing a country out 
of financial trouble. ``What we want to focus on are funds that attack 
a currency with a view to toppling it,'' said Sir Donald Tsang, the 
finance secretary of Hong Kong. But he said that there was still considerable 
argument over how far governments should go in such regulation. ``The 
debacle at LTC helped,'' he added, referring to Long Term Capital 
Management, the Greenwich, Conn., hedge fund that required a Wall 
Street bailout two weeks ago, organized by the Federal Reserve. ``Suddenly 
there was a recognition in this country that we are all in the same 
boat.'' Wolfensohn, an Australian-born former investment banker known 
for speaking his mind, painted a bleaker picture than did IMF managing 
director Michel Camdessus. ``We are not in 1928,'' Camdessus declared 
Tuesday, with his very comparison sending a chill through the vast 
hotel ballroom where the officials of the 182 nations were meeting. 
``If we keep a steady nerve, if all countries pursue stability,'' 
he insisted, the world will not slip into recession and ``this crisis 
can be overcome.'' But he insisted that the burden of economic reform 
falls on individual nations. And he made specific reference to Russia, 
saying that the IMF could not resume funding to the country until 
its new government embraces reforms. Wolfensohn's criticism of the 
IMF's to the crisis echoed a frequent criticism heard during the meetings: 
that the focus on stabilizing currencies and balancing budgets, the 
usual IMF prescriptions, was causing far too much pain to the poor 
and the middle class. Wolfensohn contended that with millions of people 
slipping below the poverty line in Indonesia and with many Russians 
unable to afford basic commodities, the risks of political upheaval 
are greatly increased. ``If we do not have greater equity and social 
justice, there will be no political stability,'' he said. ``And without 
political stability, no amount of money put together in financial 
packages will give us financial stability.'' He argued that before 
the world can turn to building what the Clinton administration calls 
a ``new international financial architecture,'' it must adjust its 
approach to the crisis so that ``mathematics will not dominate humanity.'` 
Without building political support for the bailout programs that have 
led to government austerity and unemployment, Wolfensohn said, ``we 
may build a new international financial architecture. But it will 
be a house built on sand.'' Wolfensohn's critique struck to the heart 
of the complaints from many nations _ especially Indonesia and Russia 
_ that have found fault with the Fund's priorities. But officials 
of the IMF and the U.S. Treasury _ which strongly influences its policy 
_ say that Wolfensohn has not come up with alternatives that would 
reform sick economies fast enough. ``It's easy for the bank to play 
the good guy,'' said one finance minister in Washington on Tuesday, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, ``because helping the poor is 
a lot more popular than convincing the Russians to collect their taxes 
and crack down on corruption.'' Other officials here, though, describe 
the problems differently. At a meeting of 22 nations with Clinton 
on Monday night, Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda tried 
to focus the discussion on short-term issues that need immediate attention. 
``The first is the drying up of all investment in the emerging markets,'' 
he said in an interview this evening. ``And the second is spurring 
growth in the largest countries,'' which buy the goods of Thailand 
and other nations. Tarrin said that Clinton led ``a very good discussion,'' 
but that ``we didn't get very far on anything.'' European nations, 
Tarrin and other Asian leaders said, are complacent, since they have 
been hurt the least by the global troubles. He said they are immersed 
in the launch of their common currency, the Euro. The spending limits 
European countries have placed on themselves to make the currency 
strong has limited their ability to spend more money to stimulate 
their economies, Tarrin noted. And Clinton, he noted, is also limited, 
by his continuing effort to get Congress to approve $18 billion to 
support the IMF. ``This has been a big limit on the U.S.'' Tarrin 
said, because it has prevented Clinton from proposing any short-term 
cures that involve spending more U.S. funds.
