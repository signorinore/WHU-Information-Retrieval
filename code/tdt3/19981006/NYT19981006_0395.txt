Mark Belanger, the smooth-fielding Baltimore Oriole shortstop of the 
1970s who won eight Gold Glove awards, died Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering 
Cancer Center in Manhattan. Belanger, who lived in New York, was 54. 
He developed pneumonia after having suffered from cancer, according 
to the Major League Baseball Players Association, for whom Belanger 
had worked since his playing days ended in 1982. He wasn't much of 
a hitter _ his career batting average was .228 and he had 20 homers 
in 18 seasons _ but Belanger was the premier fielder among the American 
League shortstops of his era. Displaying excellent range, quick hands 
and a strong arm, he captured the Gold Glove award in 1969 and 1971 
and then won it for six consecutive years, beginning in 1973. Signed 
by the Orioles for a $35,000 bonus out of Pittsfield (Mass.) High 
School, Belanger sparkled in his first professional season, in 1962. 
``When I first managed Mark at Bluefield in the Rookie League, I could 
see he was a natural,'' Billy Hunter, a former major league infielder 
and later an Oriole coach, would recall. ``At 18 there wasn't much 
anyone could teach him about playing shortstop. If anything, he was 
too smooth.'' In high school, Belanger considered himself better at 
basketball than baseball, and he later said that his ability to move 
so well laterally stemmed partly from basketball, where he reacted 
instinctively. He also credited Ron Hansen, a Baltimore shortstop 
in the early 1960s, with helping him get a jump on batted balls. ``He 
taught me to stand up straight and then take a few short steps in 
as the ball is pitched,'' Belanger explained. Belanger played with 
the Orioles from 1965 to 1981 and appeared in four World Series. In 
the early 1970s, he was part of an outstanding infield that had Brooks 
Robinson at third, Davey Johnson at second and Boog Powell at first. 
He was a link in an Oriole tradition of superb shortstops, taking 
over for Luis Aparicio and giving way to Cal Ripken. Belanger felt 
that his Orioles career ended the day in September 1981 when he publicly 
criticized manager Earl Weaver. ``I ripped Earl for not managing basic 
baseball,'' he said. ``I said that I thought he'd lost a lot of his 
managing prowess and that it was not something that had just happened.'' 
He said that soon after that, general manager Hank Peters told him 
the club ``had decided to go with young kids'' and did not plan to 
sign him. The Orioles did, however, give him a night in his honor 
before he left as a free agent. He played for the Los Angeles Dodgers 
in 1982, then retired. Belanger had been the Orioles' player representative 
and was among four players who negotiated alongside the union staff, 
headed by Marvin Miller, in the 1981 strike. ``This has been an education,'' 
he said during the talks, ``and I may be able to use some of it. I 
have had a course in negotiating _ free, but expensive, if you know 
what I mean.'' Belanger put his education to use upon retiring as 
a player and had been a special assistant to the union's current executive 
director, Donald Fehr. He was a liaison to the players, gathered data 
on player contracts and planned the union's annual executive board 
meetings. He is survived by his wife, Virginia; two sons, Robert and 
Richard; his parents, Edward and Marie Belanger; a brother, Al, and 
two sisters, Jeanne Heil and Linda Thornton.
