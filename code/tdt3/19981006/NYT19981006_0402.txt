The Republicans' chief investigative counsel said Tuesday that his 
recasting of the possible impeachment case against President Clinton 
was not intended to diminish the charges proposed to Congress by Whitewater 
independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Investigative counsel David Schippers 
explained in a briefing Tuesday that in his presentation on Monday 
to the House Judiciary Committee, he had made a judgment call to omit 
Starr's assertion that Clinton had abused the power of his office 
by invoking various legal privileges. But Schippers, a former prosecutor, 
virtually called on the committee to investigate further, saying the 
abuse of power accusation was still ``something that should be looked 
into in an inquiry.'' Schippers, a Democrat who will be the Republicans' 
senior aide in the investigation of the president, had expanded the 
list of possibly impeachable offenses to 15 from the 11 presented 
by Starr, and included a broad new accusation of a conspiracy to obstruct 
justice. But in omitting two of Starr's most controversial charges 
_ abuse of power and obstruction of justice when Clinton delayed appearing 
before a grand jury _ Schippers said he ``did not intend in any way 
to cast doubt'' on Starr's case. Some legal experts and House Democrats 
said Schippers, by referring to false statements under oath instead 
of to perjury, had turned to less serious charges requiring a lower 
threshold of evidence. ``This appears to be a fallback on the part 
of the Republicans by charging acts that are easier to establish,'' 
said Jeffrey Weiner, a Miami lawyer and past president of the National 
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. ``But it could backfire because 
the question becomes, `Do these lesser crimes rise to the level of 
a high crime or misdemeanor?''' But Schippers said Tuesday that he 
had chosen specific language to make the case ``a little more understandable'' 
and that he was still looking at violations of perjury statutes. He 
also noted that some aspects of the case, particularly his exploration 
of whether a conspiracy had been committed, could be more difficult 
to prove than a straightforward charge. In raising the conspiracy 
charge, Schippers said ``there was evidence tending to prove'' that 
at least the president and Monica Lewinsky had conspired to obstruct 
justice by giving false testimony in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct 
case. In a sign of where the congressional inquiry is likely to move, 
Schippers said he believed that several other individuals were involved 
in the conspiracy but did not have sufficient evidence to name them. 
On Monday, he bolstered his conspiracy accusation by using phone logs 
compiled by Starr's office that documented a flurry of calls back 
and forth shortly after Clinton's deposition in the Jones case on 
Jan. 17. The calls were between the president, his friend Vernon Jordan, 
his secretary Betty Currie; the White House counsel's office; and 
Ms. Lewinsky's pager. Democrats say the calls were simply efforts 
at political damage control because of an expected spate of news reports. 
Clinton's lawyers have accused Starr of omitting from his report Ms. 
Lewinsky's testimony before a grand jury that no one had told her 
to lie about her relationship with Clinton and that no one promised 
her a job for her silence when she filed a false affidavit in the 
Jones case. ``No one asked her to tell the truth, either,'' Schippers 
said. ``Based on my reading of the record, `no one asked me to lie' 
is a term of art.'' While he provided a framework for the investigation 
into Clinton, several Republicans on the Judiciary Committee said 
Tuesday that the committee _ and not Starr or Schippers _ would ultimately 
decide what charges, if any, would be brought against the president. 
``We're not bound by either interpretation,'' said Rep. James Rogan, 
R-Calif., a former judge. Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., a former federal 
prosecutor, said: ``There are three major areas here, allegations 
of perjury, obstruction of justice, abuse of power. Any good prosecutor 
might break that down in different ways.'' Democrats said that despite 
Schippers' detailing of 15 charges against the president, Republicans 
still had a political problem because the charges all revolved around 
Clinton's efforts to cover up his affair. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., 
said of the 15 possible charges: ``It looks like a recipe book with 
15 ways to cook spinach. But it's still about spinach. This is still 
about sex.'' Some Democrats and legal experts also said Schippers 
had stretched in making some charges. They pointed to the charge that 
Clinton might have engaged in ``misprision'' of a felony in Ms. Lewinsky's 
submitting a false affidavit. The crime is a common law crime against 
someone who knows a felony has been committed and fails to report 
it to the authorities. Weiner, the Miami lawyer, said that while the 
charge was still a federal crime, it was no longer used in most states. 
``Even though many lawyers don't know what this is because it's so 
rare,'' he said, ``the Republicans must be using this because it's 
so simple to understand.'' Schippers Tuesday that such a crime was 
``charged quite a bit.'' In fact, Michael Fortier, who had not warned 
anyone of the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, pleaded guilty to misprision 
of felony. Fortier had heard of the bombing plot from his friend, 
Timothy McVeigh, but did not tell the authorities. And in a high-profile 
case in Louisiana on Tuesday, San Francisco 49ers co-owner Eddie DeBartolo 
Jr. pleaded guilty to misprision of a felony for failing to tell the 
authorities about a supposed plan by former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards 
to extract payoffs for a riverboat casino license. Schippers rebutted 
the suggestion that he had stacked up several felony charges for the 
same action. ``Aiding and abetting a felony,'' he said, ``is different 
than committing the felony yourself.''
