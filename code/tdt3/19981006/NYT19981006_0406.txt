Things got ugly when Bob Dylan performed on May 17, 1966, at the Free 
Trade Hall in Manchester, England. A good part of the audience was 
actively hostile to Dylan's non-protest songs and his bluesy electric 
band: catcalling, shouting insults, clapping in an attempt to drown 
out the music. During a pause while the band tuned up, one heckler 
shouted ``Judas!,'' as if Dylan was both apostle and traitor to his 
true disciples. Dylan declared, ``I don't believe you,'' told the 
band to play loud and turned ``Like a Rolling Stone'' into both an 
exultant accusation and a disillusioned anthem. It was all duly recorded 
by Columbia Records, which finally releases Dylan's ``Live 1966'' 
(two CDs) this week. Proving once again that he's a lousy judge of 
his own music, Dylan was quoted in Ice magazine saying, ``If I'd thought 
this record was any good, it would have been released a long time 
ago.'' Luckily, bootleg recordings emerged anyway. And because the 
initial bootlegs were billed as the concert from the Royal Albert 
Hall, where Dylan ended his European tour 10 days later, the album 
is subtitled ``The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: The `Royal Albert Hall' 
Concert.'' (Columbia has tentatively scheduled three more finds from 
the Dylan archives for release next February, with expanded versions 
of ``Oh Mercy,'' ``The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan'' and ``Blood on the 
Tracks.'') When he performed in Manchester, Dylan was on tour between 
the release of ``Highway 61 Revisited'' and ``Blonde on Blonde,'' 
and his audiences represented two camps. Along with the rock listeners 
who had turned ``Like a Rolling Stone'' into a hit, there were folk 
fans who had wanted him to keep writing protest songs and who considered 
his electric guitar and his rock backup band to be a sellout and a 
betrayal. It was musical taste as a political and generational schism: 
an early sign of the rift between the doctrinaire, puritanical old 
left, which wanted straightforward agitprop for the masses, and the 
more amorphous, hedonistic counterculture that considered having a 
good time to be an insurrection in itself. The two sides were as dedicated 
as they were naive; capitalism would soon turn them both into market 
segments. Folkies and rockers both came to hear Dylan in concert, 
and Dylan was willing to meet old fans partway. For the first half 
of the concert, he brought out his acoustic guitar and harmonica to 
play solo versions of ``She Belongs to Me'' and ``Desolation Row'' 
along with brand new songs like ``Visions of Johanna'' and the hilariously 
deadpan ``Fourth Time Around.'' Everyone was happy with those, even 
if Dylan was teasing them with odd inflections and a drawn-out harmonica 
solo in ``Mr. Tambourine Man.'' Then, for the second half, Dylan reappeared 
with the Hawks (who would, with a different drummer, go on to become 
the Band), and the uproar began. Plugged in to a powerful sound system, 
Dylan and the Hawks riled the folk fans, as they knew they would. 
Folkies had been booing Dylan since his Newport Folk Festival appearance 
with the Butterfield Blues Band in 1965. But Dylan was too smart and 
too stubborn to let hidebound listeners prevent him from making the 
best music of his career. And in the alchemy of live performance, 
the crowd's reaction intensified the music. ``Leopard-Skin Pill-Box 
Hat'' and ``I Don't Believe You'' taunt their listeners, while ``Ballad 
of a Thin Man'' was made to perform in the faces of people who knew 
something was happening but didn't know what it was. And in ``Tell 
Me, Momma'' _ a song that had not been officially released before, 
though a variant of its lyrics was published in ``Bob Dylan: Lyrics, 
1962-1985 (Alfred A. Knopf, 1985) _ Dylan sang words that could apply 
to himself circa 1966: ``Everybody sees you on your window ledge/ 
How long is it gonna take for you to get off the edge?'' Three decades 
later, the songs and style are no longer new, as folk-rock soothes 
baby boomers on lite-rock stations. But the music Dylan made with 
the Hawks remains vital and startling and indelible, charged with 
the strangeness of the moment and the timelessness of genius. Dylan 
and the Hawks confronted their listeners with music that was at once 
deeply grounded and untamed, as trusty as the blues and as reckless 
as a band of sleepless, cocky, drugged-out renegades could make it. 
Speaking between songs, Dylan sounds logy and spaced-out; whether 
that's a put-on or a sign of fatigue is impossible to tell. But whenever 
the music kicks in, his voice is clear and invincible: scathing, funny, 
seductive, bleak, furious and preternaturally knowing. On the road 
with the group, D.A. Pennebaker was making a documentary to follow 
up ``Don't Look Back,'' the film of Dylan's English tour a year earlier. 
The 1966 footage, edited by Dylan and a cameraman, Howard Alk, became 
``Eat the Document,'' a rarity that has resurfaced for screenings 
at the Museum of Television and Radio through Nov. 20. Amid its fractured 
continuity, it shows Dylan pursuing music onstage and off, with quick 
glimpses of concerts and of late-night songwriting sessions with guitarist 
Robbie Robertson; whenever Dylan has a guitar in his hands, his concentration 
never wavers. But when he isn't making music, the camera follows an 
increasingly drawn, desolate figure, under pressure from all directions. 
In one truncated scene, Dylan is in a car with John Lennon, sitting 
with his head in his hands as Lennon tries to jolly him out of it. 
Bob Spitz's biography, ``Dylan'' (W.W. Norton, 1989), describes the 
outtakes that continued that scene, showing Dylan drugged, incoherent 
and sick. He was headed for burnout, and for the motorcycle accident 
in July 1966 that ended his most intemperate, most inspired years, 
when he burned as brightly as any great artist could. The concert 
is evidence. Drawing perverse energy from the reaction, Dylan and 
the Hawks were playing as much for themselves as for the audience, 
and they weren't going to coast. Dylan and the Hawks knew the songs 
inside out but found gleeful surprises in them again and again. The 
way Garth Hudson's organ answers each line of lyrics in ``Ballad of 
a Thin Man,'' or Robertson's lazy, twangy guitar lines cackle through 
``Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat,'' or the band unanimously ratchets up 
the last verse of ``Baby, Let Me Follow You Down,'' revel in how closely 
they were listening to each other and how fast their reactions were. 
The hecklers were wrong about the music, as most of them would probably 
admit now. Dylan's idea of American tradition was truer than what 
the acoustic-guitar purists would have enforced. He understood that 
blues, country and gospel always used the instruments at hand, and 
that the songs that collectors came to revere were written about their 
own time and place, connected to the past but not pretending to live 
in it. Yet spare a kindly thought for those righteous folkies who 
were so intent on punishing Dylan's heresy. Who now goes to a pop 
concert expected to be challenged or upset by what they hear? Who 
cares so much about artists that they would face Ticketmaster for 
the chance to correct an idol's errant ways? Wrongheaded as they were, 
the folkies were passionate about music and convinced that they could 
make a difference. It's a good thing they couldn't, but at least they 
weren't passive entertainment consumers. As the late 1960's careened 
into view, their clapping and shouting added up to their own protest 
song.
