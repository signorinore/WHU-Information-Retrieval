Two giants in the book business struck a $200 million deal Tuesday 
to become partners in a global network to sell titles in all major 
languages online, posing a powerful threat to the electronic commerce 
pioneer Amazon.com. Barnes &AMP; Noble, the largest bookstore chain 
in the United States, and Bertelsmann AG, the German media conglomerate, 
announced the plans for a joint venture involving the American chain's 
unprofitable electronic subsidiary, Barnesandnoble.com. The announcement 
was a shift in strategy for Bertelsmann, which months ago announced 
its own ambitious plans to start a worldwide electronic bookstore 
called Books Online that would take advantage of its existing distribution 
network in Europe and its longstanding experience with book clubs 
in many countries. As late as last week, executives were planning 
to introduce some of the plans for the new World Wide Web site at 
the 50th annual international book fair in Frankfurt. Instead, Thomas 
Middelhoff, the chairman and chief executive-elect of Bertelsmann, 
said the company had decided that it could move more rapidly into 
the expanding market with its $200 million purchase of a 50 percent 
stake in Barnes &AMP; Noble's electronic subsidiary. Under terms of 
the agreement, both Bertelsmann and Barnes &AMP; Noble will each invest 
$100 million in the venture. The bookstore chain's announced plans 
for an initial public offering in the electronic venture will be temporarily 
delayed. Both companies, however, said they expect a public offering 
sometime later this year. Middelhoff said the negotiations ended Tuesday 
in New York, following four months of on-again, off-again talks with 
Leonard Riggio, the chief executive of Barnes &AMP; Noble. In turn, 
Riggio said that ``from our perspective, we kind of look at this as 
a game breaker, in terms of our E-commerce business.'' He added: ``Joining 
forces with Bertelsmann is one of the most exciting things we have 
ever done. They have global reach, expertise in direct marketing.'' 
Riggio said that once the joint venture was fully established, customers 
would be able to buy practically ``any book on the planet,'' in a 
variety of languages. Bertelsmann will still move forward with plans 
for its own distinct electronic venture, Books Online, which it will 
start in November in Britain, Germany, France, Spain and the Netherlands, 
Middelhoff said. The joint venture with Barnes &AMP; Noble is Bertelsmann's 
latest move in the United States, where it became the dominant publisher 
of popular trade books with its purchase of Random House several months 
ago. Middelhoff insisted, however, that this new relationship with 
Barnes &AMP; Noble would not affect the publishing side of the conglomerate. 
``Bertelsmann will continue to adhere to our principle of decentralized 
operations, which we have consistently followed throughout our history,'' 
Middelhoff said in a news release. ``Neither our English-language 
book publishers nor our consumer direct-marketing book clubs will 
be involved in the management of operations of Barnesandnoble.com.'' 
Middelhoff added in an interview: ``As we have told everybody, we 
have an arm's-length policy.'' He said that both companies did not 
expect the venture would require any U.S. government review for antitrust 
violations because Amazon.com already had a dominant share of the 
market. An Amazon.com spokesman said the company's founder and chief 
executive, Jeff Bezos, was unavailable to comment on the impact of 
the new partnership. But it is clear that Amazon.com is already making 
moves to expand into Bertelsmann's European turf. Earlier this year, 
Amazon.com purchased a British electronic bookstore, Bookpages, and 
it is now poised to offer electronic versions in Britain and Germany, 
with new distribution outlets in Europe. Simon Murdoch, the new managing 
director of Amazon.co.uk, was asked Tuesday at a Frankfurt seminar 
whether the Seattle-based company had plans to open electronic versions 
in other European countries, but he declined to answer, saying that 
Amazon.com had only made public its plans for Britain and Germany.
