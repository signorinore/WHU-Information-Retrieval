Jean Andrus Crockett, the first chairwoman of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Philadelphia and first chairwoman of the finance department 
at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, died Oct. 
3 at her home in Media, Pa. She was 79. While at Wharton, Ms. Crockett 
conducted several analyses of the stock market and investors. In 1970, 
for example, she and two colleagues found that mutual funds did little 
to improve the market's efficiency. On average, they found, mutual-fund 
investors would have fared better had they simply bought an equal 
number of shares of every common stock on the New York Stock Exchange. 
From 1977 to 1982, she served as a director of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Philadelphia, and was appointed chairwoman of the regional 
bank in 1982. In one of her first statements in that post, she echoed 
a theme sounded by Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, who argued 
that federal deficits had to be cut to make the Fed's job less painful. 
``Interest rates,'' Ms. Crockett said, ``would not have to be this 
high if fiscal policy were used in addition to monetary policy to 
fight inflation.'' Ms. Crockett was born April 20, 1919, in Tucson, 
Ariz. Before joining the Wharton faculty in 1954, she was a mathematics 
instructor at the University of Arizona, an assistant professor of 
economics at the University of Illinois, a staff researcher for the 
Cowles Commission at the University of Chicago and an economist with 
the Commerce Department. She was promoted to full professor at Wharton 
in 1966 and named chairwoman of the finance department in 1977. In 
1989, she received the university's Distinguished Faculty Award for 
``pioneering all-University leadership and for dedication to furthering 
the careers of junior colleagues and graduate students.'' Ms. Crockett 
is survived by her husband, Robert O. Crockett Jr.; three children, 
Jennifer, Elizabeth and Robert, and three grandchildren.
