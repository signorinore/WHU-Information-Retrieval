The star of Todd Solondz's ``Happiness'' is wide-eyed, soft-edged 
and good at rolling with the punches. ``That's when my Juilliard training 
comes in handy,'' said the star in question, Jane Adams. One day she 
arrived on the ``Happiness'' set and was informed by Solondz that 
a scene scripted as a verbal showdown between her character and her 
boyfriend's other girlfriend now resembled something out of ``Caged 
Heat.'' ``Todd said, `OK, she's going to come in, spit on you, grab 
you and then the two of you will fight on the floor.' And I said, 
`O.K.!' Then I went back in the Rolodex of my mind to: `Down on the 
Ground _ With or Without Kneepads' and started to figure how to do 
it. It was kind of exciting.'' Here in the open courtyard of a bookstore 
in West Los Angeles, with her clear yogi's smile and halo of brown 
curls, Ms. Adams, 32, seemed like the last person on earth to be spit 
on _ or have her hair pulled or her face slapped, or be abused by 
a chain of besiegers. In fact, when Ms. Adams floated into the room 
for their first meeting, Solondz recalled, he thought, ``Wow!'' He 
knew he could use her unguarded quality as counterpoint to the more 
emotionally twisted characters he created in this much-talked-about 
follow-up to his feature debut, ``Welcome to the Dollhouse.'' Comic 
and unsettling, ``Happiness'' (which opens on Friday) takes three 
sisters (Ms. Adams, Lara Flynn Boyle, Cynthia Stevenson) in suburban 
New Jersey and peels the lid off their apparently ordinary lives to 
reveal a microcosm of modern-day isolation. Lurking beneath the placid 
surface of their world are child molesters, obscene phone callers, 
even a woman who murders and dismembers her rapacious doorman. From 
the start, Solondz knew that for his intricate black comedy to work, 
he'd better have at least one character whom people wouldn't mind 
hugging. With that in mind, he created Joy, the painfully trusting 
baby of the family who, when she's not trying to get her career and 
love life off the ground, is being used as a doormat by her patronizing 
siblings. With ``Happiness'' the talk of the festival circuit this 
year for its skewed view of the family, Variety noted that in a film 
filled with impressive performances, Ms. Adams easily won the sympathy 
vote by conveying ``a vulnerability and lack of fulfillment in Joy 
that is both touching and pathetic.'' ``If the audience was going 
to connect with anyone in this movie, it was going to be with Joy,'' 
said Solondz, although to alleviate any extra pressure on his gentle 
axis, he kept that information to himself. ``I certainly didn't say, 
`It's all up to (italics)you,(end italics) Jane.' But even if I did, 
it wouldn't have fazed her. I think she knew this was a role she was 
made for.'' Like most of America, Solondz was unfamiliar with the 
unfazable Ms. Adams, even though back in 1991 he might have read about 
what happened during her first job on Broadway, in ``I Hate Hamlet.'' 
Written by Paul Rudnick, the play achieved instant infamy when Ms. 
Adams's co-star Evan Handler fled the stage after being vigorously 
swatted with a prop sword for no apparent reason by another co-star, 
Nicol Williamson, the legendarily volatile actor. Fortunately for 
Ms. Adams, Williamson displayed no such ire toward his leading lady. 
``Through the fog of Nicol's many demons, he still respected Jane 
and knew that she wasn't a disposable ingenue,'' said Rudnick, who 
has a blurb-worthy way of raving about Ms. Adams's performance as 
a 29-year-old virgin in ``I Hate Hamlet,'' calling her ``an ethereal 
earth-sprite who can do pratfalls'' and ``one of those magnificent 
waifs who can make fragility seem magical and demented at the same 
time.'' ``I Hate Hamlet'' brought Ms. Adams nearly every theater award 
except the Tony (she'd collect that trophy three years later after 
appearing in a revival of ``An Inspector Calls''). Her strong stage 
work also led to supporting roles in films like ``Kansas City,'' ``I 
Love Trouble,'' and ``Father of the Bride II.'' Eventually she wanted 
more. ``I needed some experience,'' Ms. Adams said. ``I needed some 
money.'' So two years ago she made a strictly goal-oriented move from 
New York to Los Angeles and landed a berth as a sister _ just a trace 
edgier than Joy _ on the ABC drama ``Relativity.'' A cult hit, the 
show tracked the evolution of a love relationship between an exceptionally 
photogenic young couple. ``I was lucky,'' she said, because although 
the show expired after only two seasons, it lasted long enough to 
leave Ms. Adams with extra cash in her bank account and a newfound 
ease in front of the camera. She'd stopped feeling as if she were 
lying when she sat down with a director and assured him, ``I can carry 
this film.'' Her confidence was hard won. Growing up in Wheaton, Ill., 
the eldest daughter of William Adams, an engineer, and Janice Adams, 
an administrative assistant (Ms. Adams has a younger brother), she 
made her stage debut as the wooden marionette in a seventh-grade production 
of ``Pinocchio.'' After graduating from high school, Ms. Adams briefly 
took theater classes at Seattle's prestigious Cornish Institute, then 
became an uninspired political science major at the University of 
Washington. Unable to kick her drama habit entirely, however, she 
began appearing in local theater again, and eventually found the gumption 
to relocate to New York and give acting school another shot by enrolling 
at the Juilliard School. Four years later, Ms. Adams had a bachelor's 
degree in fine arts, an unpaid student loan and untold memories of 
living in roach-infested hotel rooms and fixing grilled hot dog dinners 
in an electric wok on the floor. Around this time, she landed a small 
role as Michael J. Fox's girlfriend in the final episode of ``Family 
Ties.'' After that, though, there were long, dry spells in which Ms. 
Adams happily supported herself as a teacher at Tompkins Hall Nursery 
School. Often, she'd dash straight from the playground to a try-out, 
a habit that proved vexing to more than one Manhattan casting director. 
``They'd call my agent and ask, `Can she at least brush her hair?' 
'' said Ms. Adams. During the making of ``Happiness,'' Solondz's most 
frequent instruction to Ms. Adams was, ``Let's do it again, this time 
with `more child,' '' trying to get her to convey how Joy has a blind 
openness to everyone in her path, no matter whether they come bearing 
kisses or stinging criticism. Even after 18-hour days on the ``Happiness'' 
set in New Jersey, when Ms. Adams would head home to New York feeling 
``sleep-deprived and hallucinating,'' by the next morning she was 
ready to return. ``I can't afford to be as naive as Joy, but it was 
wonderful to be allowed to live in her skin,'' said Ms. Adams by telephone 
a few weeks later, after having accompanied ``Happiness'' to film 
festivals in Deauville, France, and Toronto. There, she said, she 
encountered ``whole tablefuls of people debating, which I think is 
a testament to Todd. ``They either didn't get it _ or they really 
loved it.'' As for her family, they have not yet seen ``Happiness,'' 
although her mother read the script before shooting began. ``She told 
me that she liked it,'' said Ms. Adams. ``But she also said, `Thank 
(italics)God,(end italics) you're not part of the pedophilia storyline.'
