Gov. George Pataki is taking advantage of one of the most powerful 
and time-honored perks of political incumbency _ the ability to dole 
out the largesse of government. But instead of the usual library grant 
here, road project there, the governor is going tradition one better, 
with two programs that are sending refund checks to more than 1 million 
New Yorkers in the middle of his campaign for a second term. The refunds 
are a result of Pataki's having found at least partial solutions to 
two of the state's more intractable problems _ rising property taxes 
and Long Island's high utility rates _ and many Democrats have been 
unwilling to carp about the timing. The governor traveled to Long 
Island on Tuesday to pose for pictures with residents who have benefited 
from the property tax-reduction program for the elderly, and to hand 
Angelo Pioli, a man in his 70s, the first of 1 million rebate checks 
for customers of the now-defunct Long Island Lighting Co. Standing 
under the oak tree in Pioli's front yard here, Pataki insisted that 
there was nothing political about the blizzard of checks being delivered 
during the campaign. ``This was the soonest they could go out,'' he 
said. ``If we could have done it sooner, we would have.'' His Democratic 
opponent, New York City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, charged that 
the check-writing was nothing but politics. ``It's really so transparent, 
it's sad,'' he said. ``He can't possibly think the people are so easily 
fooled.'' But among the parade of Long Island elected officials who 
joined the governor and praised him Tuesday were a number of Democrats 
who were not inclined to take issue with the timing. ``Sure, there 
might be politics to it and he gets the political benefit,'' said 
Bruce Nyman, the Democratic minority leader of the Nassau County Legislature. 
``That's fine with me. He's the one who made it happen.'' The utility 
rebate checks are a product of the $6 billion takeover of LILCO in 
May by the Long Island Power Authority, a state agency. By refinancing 
LILCO's debts at lower interest rates, the authority has reduced electric 
rates an average of 20 percent, saving customers about $490 million 
a year. In the next few days, every home and business in Nassau County 
and the Rockaways is to get a check for $232, and those in Suffolk 
County will get $101. Each of those one million checks will be accompanied 
by a letter from the Long Island Power Authority praising the governor. 
This comes on the heels of checks averaging about $750 going to 700,000 
low- and moderate-income elderly residents across the state over the 
last six weeks, under Pataki's effort to reduce the property taxes 
charged by local school districts. Beginning next year, every homeowner 
in the state is to be included in what the governor has called the 
Star program, which he says will lower the average property tax bill 
27 percent by 2003. There was no reason for either program to send 
out checks. Property tax and utility bills could simply have been 
reduced by the appropriate amount. Done that way, voters might never 
have noticed the benefit, or at least might not have been aware that 
it was Pataki they had to thank.
