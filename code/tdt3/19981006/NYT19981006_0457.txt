The Yankees could be compared to some of the greatest teams in history 
if they win the World Series. But it is unlikely the team that won 
114 games in the regular season will remain intact. Bernie Williams, 
the team's star center fielder, will become a free agent at season's 
end. Speculation is already rampant that another team, such as the 
Arizona Diamondbacks, Texas Rangers or Baltimore Orioles, will offer 
him well over $10 million a year, for at least six years. The Yankees 
are paying him $8.25 million this year and must decide if he is worth 
an eight-digit salary. ``He's a guy we want to keep,'' said Yankees 
general manager Brian Cashman before the Yankees faced the Cleveland 
Indians in Game 1 of the American League Championship Series on Tuesday 
night at Yankee Stadium. ``There's no question we'll be bidding for 
him. We're going to go after him and make him an offer we feel comfortable 
with.'' Whether the Yankees re-sign Williams will have a major impact 
on other decisions. If Williams leaves, the Yankees have to look for 
another center fielder. If he stays and is paid an eight-figure salary, 
the Yankees may have to cut corners elsewhere _ perhaps at third base. 
Scott Brosius, who had a spectacular year offensively and defensively 
and fit in very well with this team, can also become a free agent 
after this season and would be likely to command three- or four-year 
offers, perhaps in the range of $4 million a year. ``He's been an 
important cog for us this year, and our intention is to pursue him,'' 
said Cashman, who broke off negotiations with Brosius' agent late 
in the season. ``If we're unsuccessful in doing that, we've got a 
guy behind him in the minors'' _ the young third baseman Mike Lowell 
_ ``who we think is ready.'' Lowell would play for the minimum wage 
next season. Is Brosius' fate tied to whether Williams re-signs? ``Everything 
is tied together,'' Cashman said. ``The bottom line is, we have only 
so much money we can play with.'' If Williams does leave, the Yankees 
could bid on free agents such as Steve Finley or Brian Jordan, or 
attempt to trade for a player such as the Angels' Jim Edmonds. Among 
the other decisions: _ David Cone pitched more than 200 innings this 
season, activating a clause in his contract that gives him the option 
of accepting or rejecting a $5.5 million salary with the Yankees next 
season. Coming off a 20-victory season, it would figure that Cone 
would try to parlay his leverage into either a new multiyear contract, 
or more money above and beyond the $5.5 million. Cone and Cashman 
both say they will worry about this in the off season. _ Tim Raines 
can become a free agent in the off season, and the Yankees have liked 
his production and contribution. But Ricky Ledee will be out of options 
next season and must remain on the Yankees' roster, and the September 
emergence of Shane Spencer gives the Yankees another outfield option. 
It would seem to be unlikely that Raines will return. _ The Yankees 
hold a $2.5 million option for the 1999 season on Darryl Strawberry, 
the outfielder who hit 24 homers before undergoing surgery for colon 
cancer. If Strawberry were a free agent, his value would have plummeted. 
But the decision on whether to keep Strawberry, it would seem, will 
be in the hands of George Steinbrenner, who must decide how much he 
is worth to the team. _ The Yankees hold a $3.4 million option for 
the 1999 season on catcher Joe Girardi, but with Jorge Posada progressing 
into the frontline catcher this year, the Yankees probably will not 
exercise the option. But they may try to negotiate another contract 
with Girardi, to keep him as a backup. Girardi said during the season 
that he would like to see if he could catch full time elsewhere, before 
adding that he would be very open to returning to the Yankees. _ Chuck 
Knoblauch, the Yankees' second baseman, could demand a trade after 
this season. But according to a member of the Yankees organization, 
Knoblauch has agreed to a two-year contract extension beyond his current 
deal that would pay him $9 million for the 2002 and 2003 seasons. 
Cashman would not comment on the possible extension, saying, ``He's 
a guy we don't plan on having go anywhere.'' Cashman, 31, is earning 
about $250,000 in his first year as general manager of the Yankees. 
When he took the job, he asked for a one-year contract. ``I'll sit 
down at the end of the year and see if he's interested in having me 
back,'' he said. Might Cashman's fate depend on whether the Yankees 
defeat the Indians in this series and go on to win the World Series? 
``I have no idea, to be honest with you,'' he said.
