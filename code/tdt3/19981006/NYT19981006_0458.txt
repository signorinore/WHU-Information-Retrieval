The superb swing that propelled Bernie Williams to an American League 
batting title is still there, although it might be a little tentative. 
The classy demeanor that has enabled Williams to play for the attention-grabbing 
Yankees without distractions as he approaches free agency is still 
there, although it might be tested if his drought continues for the 
rest of October. For many Yankee fans, the lasting image of the 1997 
division series is not Paul O'Neill's scorched double off the right 
center-field fence. It is of Jose Mesa's next pitch, the pitch Williams 
flicked to left field for the final out of the game and the season. 
There was scant time to revel in O'Neill's gutsy hit and his tumbling 
slide because Williams did not deliver the tying run against Cleveland 
and the stunned Yankees were sent home. ``I know one thing, that last 
year Bernie was very disappointed when he made the last out,'' said 
Yankee manager Joe Torre. ``Let's admit it, the year before, everything 
Bernie made contact with was a homer or a hit.'' Torre heard about 
Williams' funk, called him in Bayamon, Puerto Rico, and spoke to him 
in the soothing, simplistic way that explains why he is the perfect 
manager for this often perfect team. ``I just told him he can't expect 
to get a hit every time up,'' said Torre. ``He had to let it go.'' 
Said Williams: ``Last year is last year. This is a new year. There 
are two teams that are both different.'' Still, it is impossible to 
ignore the obvious circumstances and glaring statistics. Williams 
was 0 for 11 as the Yankees swept the Rangers in the division series, 
even while receiving little production from the top five hitters in 
their order. Has Williams let go of the 1997 postseason failure? A 
drought that actually extends to the 1996 World Series? Since being 
named the Most Valuable Player of the American League Championship 
Series two years ago, when he steered the Yankees by the Orioles, 
Williams has six hits in his last 52 at-bats in the postseason, with 
one homer and five runs batted in. That is not what players who want 
at least $11 million a year are supposed to do, not when the national 
spotlight is so intense and the stakes are so high. Williams, a switch-hitter, 
has struggled to drill fastballs from the left side and is flaring 
or popping up pitches that he used to hit forcefully. When Williams 
was asked if there was anything he would do differently in the opener 
of the ALCS Tuesday night, he had the look of a sixth-grader who has 
just been told that his science project was awful. He pondered the 
question for a few seconds and then sounded like a player who is searching 
for something he cannot find, something he found so simply a week 
ago. ``I wouldn't know what to change,'' said Williams. ``I have the 
same swing I've had all year. I know I've been through rough times 
before and I've kept working hard. I know that eventually it's going 
to turn around. It has in the past. It's the only thing I can do.'' 
As Torre discussed how Williams has fizzled in the postseason recently, 
he said that ``sometimes you overthink and overprepare'' and wondered 
if the 30-year-old was doing that. Torre hinted that Williams might 
be thinking too much about the importance of the postseason instead 
of treating the games like games. ``I don't think it's anything other 
than being in a short series and wanting to win,'' said Torre. ``It's 
not like during the season when you have a couple of hitless games 
and you can come back because you have 160 games left. It takes a 
lot to tell yourself not to put too much emphasis on each at-bat.'' 
The Yankees proudly and rightfully raved about a pitching staff that 
limited Texas to one earned run in three games, but what about the 
disappearance of the first five in the order? Chuck Knoblauch was 
1 for 11, Derek Jeter was 1 for 9, Paul O'Neill was 4 for 11, Tino 
Martinez was 3 for 11 and Williams, of course, was 0 for 11. O'Neill's 
homer drove in the only run from among this quintet. ``I think in 
the next round you can expect our bats to wake up,'' promised David 
Cone. ``I think you can expect Bernie and Paul and Tino to really 
start swinging the bats.'' While the Yanks blazed to a league record 
of 114 victories, Williams' status was hardly even an issue. That 
is amazing, especially in New York. Williams and Scott Boras, his 
agent, told the Yankees that they did not want to negotiate a long-term 
contract once the season began so the two sides have not had formal 
discussions since March. Williams does not want to think about it 
now, but there is a possibility he could be playing his last days 
with the Yankees. It is the organization the all-star center fielder 
has been with since he was 17, another reason why Williams should 
want to make this postseason gratifying, for himself and for the Yankees. 
``I don't think I've been pressing,'' said Williams, before vanishing 
into the Yankee clubhouse Tuesday night. ``It's kind of tough to answer 
that right now, but I don't think so.''
