Market Dude, a New York Stock Exchange floor broker whose real name 
is Allan Gershowitz, was on the phone and skeptical. ``This is either 
a hoax _ one of the boys set you up to call me _ or it's real,'' he 
said. It was real. Did Market Dude _ so named by Fortune magazine 
this month for the pictures of him that pop up in publications all 
over the world after every market swing _ have time to answer a few 
questions? Such as, who is he? Why him? Millions of people have seen 
him with his hand clasped on his face in agony after some market atrocity, 
but no one has ever interviewed him. Three hours later, 15 minutes 
before Monday's closing bell, Gershowitz (one is tempted to call him 
Mr. Dude) was showing his inquisitor around his universe _ the more-or-less 
center of the universe, the main trading floor of the New York Stock 
Exchange _ while trying to buy 100,000 shares of BankAmerica. This 
was further complicated by Gershowitz's fellow brokers, who have not 
let up in their ribbing since Market Dude was born. One even faked 
a call from the David Letterman show, requesting Market Dude as a 
guest. Gershowitz believed him, hence his subsequent suspicion toward 
press calls. ``Excuse me,'' said one broker, scurrying by. ``The Japanese 
would like to know if you'd pose for them.'' ``Market Dude,'' called 
another. ``See, Al might be the Market Dude,'' said a third, James 
Mack, pulling out a well-worn clipping of himself in a Japanese newspaper, 
``but I'm what's called the International Market Dude.'' And so on. 
Gershowitz, 51, traces his fame to location, location, location. His 
booth on the floor is right below the balcony where photographers 
take pictures, most often when the market is crashing. When Gershowitz 
looks at the electronic ticker tape above his booth, he also looks 
straight into a phalanx of lenses. ``You can tell with my face, most 
of the time, what's happening to the market,'' he said, adding that 
``if I bought something at 52 and it's trading at 51, I get a little 
upset.'' Gershowitz is an independent floor broker _ one of roughly 
500 on the exchange _ who takes orders to buy and sell stock for such 
clients as money managers, institutions and banks. Although computers 
now handle some 40 percent of the trading volume on the exchange, 
primarily smaller orders, floor brokers handle institutional clients 
and say they can get better prices because they bargain directly on 
the floor with other human beings _ the ``specialists'' who buy and 
sell individual stocks. Monday, just as the bell was sounding, Gershowitz's 
last trade was for the purchase of BankAmerica shares from James Emrich, 
a specialist. ``At 15 you can buy 50,000,'' Emrich said. ``I'll buy 
50,000,'' Gershowitz said. The price was 51 15/16, or 51 and 15 ``teenies'' 
in broker lingo. Since the stock traded as high Monday as 54~, Gershowitz 
was pleased. If he had bought the 50,000 shares at, say, 52, it would 
have cost his client $2.6 million _ or $3,125 more. ``That teeny is 
worth a lot of money done enough times,'' Gershowitz said. After the 
bell, Gershowitz repaired to the exchange's Luncheon Club, filled 
with mounted animal heads, to talk about how he got into the business. 
Basically it all goes back to a 1966 subway ride. Gershowitz was traveling 
downtown looking for a job after graduating from DeWitt Clinton High 
School in the Bronx, and somebody on the train told him that Wall 
Street was the last stop before Brooklyn. He got off, found a job 
as a clerk at what was then Bache &AMP; Co., moved to another firm, 
then filled in for a vacationing order clerk on the exchange floor. 
``Well, I never left,'' he said. The reason is simple. ``I just like 
the action,'' he said. In 1979, Gershowitz bought his own seat on 
the exchange for $150,000 _ ``I borrowed from everybody I could'' 
_ and now has his own firm, Allen E. Gershowitz Securities Corp. (Exchange 
seats sell today for as much as $2 million.) His office is his booth 
on the exchange floor. He makes his money in commissions on trades, 
and won't say what that amounts to per year, but floor brokers can 
make between $300,000 and $1 million annually. He will say his life 
has worked out. ``I wasn't a good student,'' Gershowitz said. ``What 
I wanted to do all the time was play basketball. And my father, who 
worked at the post office, worked at night, because you made more 
money that way. So maybe I didn't have the guidance I should have.'' 
Gershowitz paused. ``Down here, there are a lot of stories like that.'' 
Gershowitz wears a gold Cartier watch and a big green ring on his 
pinkie finger. ``Everybody thinks it's an emerald,'' he said. ``It's 
not. I wish it was.'' His face is tan these days _ he was recently 
on a trip to Italy. He calls women ``sweetheart,'' lives with his 
wife of 20 years in Woodbury on Long Island, and has no children. 
He plays basketball, works out, and says he first started noticing 
pictures of himself around 1996, when interest in stocks picked up. 
In November 1997, Newsday ran photographs of him under the headline 
``The Face of the Market.'' Being Market Dude, he said, hasn't caused 
him to mug for the cameras because he's too busy. Has Hollywood called? 
``No,'' he said. ``But I'm waiting. I don't want a big part. I want 
to be a character actor. A lot of people think I'm a character down 
here.''
