NEW YORK _ ``You Gotta Believe'' is emblazoned next to a picture of 
Darryl Strawberry on the front page of a tabloid that someone has 
tossed onto a table in a conference room. Since the Yankee left fielder 
successfully underwent surgery Saturday to remove a tumor from his 
colon, that phrase has meaning beyond mere games for several baseball 
fans sitting around the table. Like Strawberry, they are recovering 
drug addicts. Once princes in their own chemical Camelots of hazy 
highs and brutal lows, they now live at Samaritan Village's Van Wyck 
treatment center in Jamaica, Queens. Inside a squat brick building 
alongside the expressway, they have come to learn that sobriety doesn't 
guarantee a life without problems. It does give them the tools to 
live life on its own terms, even when the terms are grim. To them, 
the grace and humility with which Strawberry has confronted his health 
problems has renewed their belief in the strength of sobriety. In 
whispered conversations in their rooms or while sharing at house meetings 
each morning, they get support from a man who is very much present 
among them even as he rests in a hospital miles away. So, while Ernest 
M. never met Darryl S., he can identify more than he ever imagined. 
Two weeks ago, Ernest learned he was HIV positive. ``My first thought 
was why not get high,'' said Ernest, who, like others at the center, 
spoke on the condition that his full name not be used. ``That wouldn't 
have changed anything. I've been here five months. I came to believe 
and realize it's all up to the individual how you deal with something. 
Just because you're in recovery doesn't mean everything is perfect. 
But you deal with things as an adult. That's what Darryl's doing. 
He's not running away. He's not stirring the pity pot.'' Disbelief 
was the first reaction for many of the men and women who see themselves 
as a family at the treatment center. Strawberry is a survivor, and 
he has dominated their thoughts since they learned about his tumor. 
Recovering addicts say you don't get this far to be let down, but 
it was hard for them to uncover the meaning behind Strawberry's latest 
trials as they gathered for their house meeting. ``You could just 
hear the sighs and oohs and ahhs from our family when it was brought 
up,'' said Pete P. ``I've followed his ups and downs through the years. 
Marital problems. Treatment. Being traded to different teams. Falling 
down, then doing everything he had to do to build his life back up. 
He had it all. Then boom. How could this happen?'' Because it does. 
The question for many of them was how to handle it. Strawberry has 
fame and wealth, which bring with them an outpouring of public support 
as well as the ability to afford the best medical care. But for recovering 
addicts of any social class, all riches flow from sobriety. In various 
ways, that lesson is hammered home in therapeutic communities where 
men like Ernest and Pete learn to put some gratitude into their daily 
attitude. They value the fact that for a lot of them, the only thing 
they have is the fact they are sober,'' said John Tavolacci, the center's 
director. ``When something happens in their lives, when they're really 
using what they've learned, why would they throw away something they 
really value?'' Among the little things Pete and his friends value 
is the chance to watch the Yankees in their series against Cleveland. 
They're psyched, but they wonder how Strawberry must feel being sidelined 
while the Yanks are in the playoffs. ``He's sitting out the most important 
games of the year,'' Pete said. ``The feelings going through his mind 
must be something, on top of his surgery. To go through so much. If 
he doesn't get high through this time, he's not going to get high.'' 
That's how Ernest decided to face his own illness. He figures he has 
a better chance of staying well as long as he takes his medication 
and keeps on top of whatever else pops up in his life. ``I can't be 
like Darryl, with the best doctors,'' he said. ``But I can stay sober. 
That, I know I can do. Like Darryl knows he can.'' Ernest wants to 
really live before he dies. It means getting past the stigma that 
some put on HIV. Or cancer. Or addiction. ``You know what they say 
about an untreated addiction,'' Ernest said. ``It leads to death, 
jail or institutions. So far, I've been through two of those. I don't 
want to see the other.'' Not yet. Not today. Not when you believe.
