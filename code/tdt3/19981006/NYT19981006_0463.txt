James P. Hoffa, widely considered the front-runner in the race for 
the Teamsters presidency, does not intend to participate in the Oct. 
19 candidates' debate scheduled by the court-appointed officer overseeing 
the election, the Hoffa campaign announced Tuesday. Hoffa's campaign 
manager, Tom Pazzi, said in a statement that the election officer 
``is seeking to cooperate with corporate media giants to catapult 
Hoffa's opponents into a name recognition and stature which they, 
unlike Hoffa, haven't earned.'' The two other candidates, Thomas Leedham, 
head of the Teamsters' warehouse division, and John Metz, head of 
the public employees' division, have told election monitor Michael 
Cherkasky that they plan to participate in the debate. Jeff O'Mara, 
a spokesman for Cherkasky, said the debate, to be held at American 
University in Washington, would proceed without Hoffa. Hoffa's refusal 
to debate represents a reversal from his position in the 1996 race 
for the presidency of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, 
when he repeatedly demanded a debate and often ridiculed the incumbent, 
Ron Carey, for refusing to face him. Carey narrowly defeated Hoffa, 
son of the famous Teamsters leader Jimmy Hoffa, but Cherkasky's predecessor 
as election monitor invalidated Carey's victory, finding that he had 
improperly siphoned more than $700,000 in union money to help his 
campaign. In a telephone interview, Leedham attacked his opponent's 
refusal to debate. ``Junior is afraid to debate, and if he's afraid 
to take me on in a debate, I wonder where he's going to find the guts 
to take on the United Parcel Service or the freight companies,'' Leedham 
said. ``He's in a position where he's afraid to have to defend his 
shady past and his past connections. He's afraid that the people will 
see he has no record and very little knowledge about the union.'' 
Metz did not reply to a message left on the answering machine at his 
campaign headquarters. Hoffa campaign officials said the current situation 
was different from 1996. Hoffa's demand for a debate then, they said, 
was warranted because Hoffa and Carey had nearly equal support and 
name recognition.
