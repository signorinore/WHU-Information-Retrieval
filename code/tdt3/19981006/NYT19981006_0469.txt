Seeking to seize an issue from his Democratic opponent's quiver, Sen. 
Alfonse D'Amato testified at a Senate hearing Tuesday in support of 
legislation intended to reduce acid rain, which he called ``airborne 
terrorism'' that is defoliating New York's forests and destroying 
its lakes. Without the legislation he is sponsoring, ``we could never, 
ever protect those lakes,'' D'Amato told the Senate clean air subcommittee. 
``If we were to shut down every motor vehicle in New York, close all 
of our factories, we would still have the same degradation of our 
quality of life.'' But two hours later, D'Amato's Democratic challenger, 
Rep. Charles Schumer, held a news conference near the Capitol to accuse 
D'Amato of trying to whitewash nearly 18 years of anti-environmental 
votes. ``Today, a leopard is trying to change his spots,'' Schumer 
said. ``Al D'Amato's environmental record is one of the worst in the 
nation. New York's families can't trust Al D'Amato to protect the 
environment.'' The dueling events spotlighted the importance of the 
environment to both men's political calculations in what is shaping 
up to be perhaps the tightest Senate race in the country. For D'Amato, 
a Republican whose record is considered spotty by many environmental 
groups, the issue provides a way of distancing himself from conservative 
Republicans and softening his image among moderate New York voters. 
For Schumer, who has received consistently high ratings from environmental 
groups, the issue provides a way of showing a clear difference between 
him and D'Amato, a three-term incumbent whom Schumer has sought to 
portray as a right-wing extremist. D'Amato's bill would require industries 
to reduce the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which 
are typically released by coal-burning plants in the Midwest and drift 
on the prevailing winds to the Northeast, where they turn to acid 
rain and snow. Schumer and some environmental groups scoffed at the 
timing of the senator's testimony in support of the legislation, contending 
that D'Amato's allies in the Senate Republican majority had scheduled 
the hearing to provide D'Amato an election-season platform. The Senate 
is scheduled to go into recess on Friday and D'Amato's bill has no 
chance of passing before then, and thus no chance to be approved this 
year. ``Today's hearing is a total farce designed to give Al D'Amato 
a little election-year cover,'' Schumer said. But some environmental 
advocates _ as well as aides to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., 
who endorsed Schumer last Saturday _ came to D'Amato's defense Tuesday, 
saying that D'Amato has been pushing his bill for more than a year 
and had nothing to do with scheduling the hearing in the heat of the 
election. Tony Bullock, chief of staff for Moynihan, said that it 
was Moynihan, co-sponsor of the bill, who requested the hearing last 
month and that it was delayed until now to allow for the release of 
a major acid rain study. ``I'm saddened to see a partisan spin to 
it,'' Bullock said. Several environmental groups that support the 
bill also praised D'Amato's work on the issue, saying that they wanted 
a hearing before the recess to give them a jump on passing the legislation 
next year. ``This is an issue whose time has come,'' said Timothy 
Burke, executive director of the Adirondack Council. ``It's not about 
politics.'' But other environmental groups used Tuesday's events to 
attack D'Amato. The Sierra Club, which has been running an independent 
campaign against the senator this year, delivered black balloons emblazoned 
``D'Amato's hot air'' to D'Amato's office. ``This is a classic case 
of election-year environmentalism,'' said Kathryn Hohmann, the club's 
director of environmental quality. The League of Conservation Voters 
also issued score cards showing that D'Amato's lifetime environmental 
voting record, as judged by the group, was 32 out of 100, while Schumer's 
was 88. The group noted that D'Amato ranked consistently lower than 
other Republicans from the Northeast, with his scores even hitting 
zero twice, in 1994 and 1996. Schumer routinely scored higher than 
Democrats from the region.
