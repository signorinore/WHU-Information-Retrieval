The usual guideline for a team that has grown accustomed to winning 
all the time is to act in tune with having been there before. The 
usual danger for such a team is it becomes blase about its achievements. 
More than any other team in the major leagues, the Atlanta Braves 
have become accustomed to success. Game 1 of the National League Championship 
Series at Turner Field Wednesday night will mark the seventh consecutive 
time that Atlanta will be in post-season play. This time, the Braves 
will be going up against a team _ the San Diego Padres _ that hasn't 
been this far since 1984. But the Braves don't appear to be taking 
the ho-hum approach. When they dispatched the Chicago Cubs in three 
straight games in the first part of the playoffs last week, they celebrated 
with a considerable amount of giddiness, even if the sweep was hardly 
a surprise. Tuesday, some of the veteran Braves credited the impact 
of new players like Andres Galarraga and Walt Weiss for helping make 
the team feel a little hungrier, a little more determined and a little 
more appreciative of its good fortune as it attempts to make it to 
the World Series, where the Braves were turned back by the Yankees 
in 1996. ``We all get a little spoiled sometimes,'' said Chipper Jones, 
who has played in the NLCS every season since he became a regular 
in in 1995. Galarraga, the slick-fielding first-baseman who has given 
the Braves a right-handed force in the middle of the lineup this season, 
has never been to a World Series. Weiss, a steady shortstop and leadoff 
hitter who was selected to his first All-Star team this season, has 
not been to the World Series since 1990, when he played with Oakland. 
Neither is trying to play down his excitement. ``There's enough new 
guys over here that we were really excited about winning a division 
and winning the division series,'' Weiss said. ``And it was kind of 
contagious. From what I've heard, it wasn't that big a deal in the 
past.'' The way many of the Braves sounded Tuesday, on the eve of 
their four-of-seven-game series with the underdog Padres, a hungrier 
attitude was just what they needed after being upset by the Florida 
Marlins, 4 games to 2, in the NLCS a year ago. And that was something 
Javy Lopez alluded to when he said that Weiss and Galarraga have a 
different attitude than former Braves like Kenny Lofton and Fred McGriff. 
``We have a different perspective anyway with the guys we've added,'' 
said John Smoltz, who will start Game 1 for Atlanta against the San 
Diego right-hander Andy Ashby. ``They're not taking anything for granted.'' 
Here in Atlanta, however, it is easy to see why people might take 
a lot for granted. Since 1991, the Braves have 757 regular-season 
victories, 71 more than the Yankees and 116 more than the nearest 
NL team, the Houston Astros. And so, when Jones said, ``We,'' he was 
also speaking of the hometown fans, who have witnessed the Braves 
win seven division titles in a row _ excluding the 1994 strike-shortened 
season. Smoltz said, ``Nothing short of winning the World Series will 
be acceptable here,'' adding that it is a little unfair. ``Since 1991, 
we've played five different teams in the NLCS,'' said the 31-year-old 
right-hander, who went 17-3 this year after undergoing off-season 
elbow surgery. ``It's easy to say that we only have won one World 
Championship. But credit needs to be given.'' Smoltz, who is 11-3 
with a 2.29 career post-season ERA, was speaking from the perspective 
of having pitched for a team that had lost 106 games in 1988 and 97 
games in both 1989 and 1990. ``Glavine and I have been humiliated 
and laughed at,'' Smoltz said, referring to Tom Glavine, Atlanta's 
Game 2 starter, who was also there in the dreary years. ``That's why 
this means so much to us. When this run is over, they're going to 
appreciate it so much more than they do now. It's going to be like, 
`Remember the 90's. Man, that was great.''' That's why the Braves 
sounded a little miffed when they were subjected to ``Let's Go Cubs!'' 
chants in their own ball park during the first round. They heard the 
same sort of chants for the Yankees in the 1996 World Series. When 
asked Tuesday if he would ever expect to hear ``Let's Go Braves!'' 
at Yankee Stadium, Jones quickly answered no. ``Not unless they're 
on a suicide mission,'' Jones said. The Braves have a much different 
mission this week: to get back to the World Series, to win another 
one, and to once and for all quiet the critics, many of whom come 
from their own hometown. But regardless of what happens with the Padres, 
Smoltz figures his team deserves a little more respect. ``We won our 
seventh division title this season,'' Smoltz said. ``I just can't 
see that ever being done again.''
