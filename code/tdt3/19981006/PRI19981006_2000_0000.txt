This is "The World," a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI 
and WGBH Boston. It's Tuesday, October 6. I'm Tony Kahn. Today, President 
Clinton warned Slobodan Milosevic of air strikes if Serbian troops 
don't leave Kosovo. But there are warnings from Serbia, too. What 
worries me is the collateral damage that will come with air strikes. 
I'm not talking about bombs missing their targets. I'm talking about 
the reaction of the Milosevic regime. There will be retribution. Everyone 
here believes it's highly likely. Also, in Hong Kong, the Big Mac, 
large fries and a valuable Snoopy doll. First is news. From National 
Public Radio News in Washington, I'm Corey Flintoff.
