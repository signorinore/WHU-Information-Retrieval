President Clinton called on international financial officials today 
to take steps to solve the world economic crisis. The president spoke 
at the yearly joint meeting of the International Monetary Fund and 
the World Bank in Washington. He said Europe must boost its economic 
growth and Japan must deregulate its economy while stabilizing its 
banking system. He urged Congress to approve funding for the IMF, 
saying the fund is essential to U.S. efforts to contain the crisis. 
The president said the world financial system needs long-term reforms 
that will prevent huge swings in the global economy now that the world 
markets are active on a 24-hour basis.
