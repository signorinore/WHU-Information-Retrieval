Congressional Republican leaders plan to meet tomorrow with White 
House chief of staff Erskine Bowles as lawmakers scramble to complete 
work on annual spending bills and return home to campaign for re-election. 
NPR's Brian Naylor reports. Most government agencies are operating 
under a temporary funding bill that expires Friday. As is usual, several 
of the permanent spending bills are caught in disputes between Republican 
congressional leaders and the White House. House majority leader Dick 
Armey says there are fewer such disputes this year. He says he walked 
away from the school voucher proposal Republicans wanted in the bill 
that funds the operations of the District of Columbia. But other disputes 
remain. One involves the perennial battle over U.S. funding for international 
family planning. Another is over how the 2000 census should be conducted. 
Senate majority leader Trent Lott says the White House has embarked 
on a "wag the dog" strategy, threatening to shut down the government 
to distract attention from other problems. The White House counters 
that it's Republicans who are seeking a distraction from a lack of 
legislative accomplishments. Brian Naylor, NPR News, the Capitol.
