A new studies says six seats -- six states lost seats in the House 
because of an influx of immigrants, and the study predicts seven more 
states will lose out after the 2000 census. NPR's Barbara Bradley 
has more. The report by the Center for Immigration Studies, a group 
that advocates lower immigration, says that new immigrants tend to 
settle in just a handful of states. The number of House seats is determined 
by the number of people in the state, whether they are citizens, legal 
immigrants or illegal aliens. And so, immigrants will boost the number 
of House members in immigrant-heavy states. California will get an 
extra nine seats. New York gets two, and Texas and Florida gain one 
each. The losers tend to be in the Midwest -- Michigan, Mississippi, 
Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin will all lose seats after the 2000 
census. Immigrants advocates criticized the report. They noted that 
this year's immigrant may be next year's citizen, and everyone deserves 
to be counted. Barbara Bradley, NPR News, Washington.
