In Riverside, California, a former city employee allegedly opened 
fire this morning in the city council chambers. NPR's Mandalit Del 
Barco reports from Riverside. The Riverside mayor and city council 
members were meeting in a small room behind city council chambers 
when a gunman burst in, took them hostage and began to shoot. Mayor 
Ron Loveridge described to reporters what happened. It was surrealistic 
-- something you'd see in a movie or on television, and you also recognized 
that you may or may not leave that room. Loveridge was shot in the 
shoulder and neck, not seriously. Two city council members were also 
wounded. One of them in critical condition. Police say the alleged 
shooter, Joseph Neal, also shot two police officers in a gun battle 
in which he was also shot. Forty-eight-year-old Neal, who is in custody, 
is a former employee with the city's parks and recreation department 
who has a wrongful termination suit pending. Mandalit Del Barco, NPR 
News, outside Riverside city hall.
