The European parliament voted overwhelmingly today to strip a French 
extremist politician of his protection from prosecution. The action 
clears the way for a German court to try French right-wing leader 
Jean-Marie LePen for trivializing the Holocaust by describing it in 
a Munich news conference as a "detail in the history of the second 
world war." LePen is a member of the European parliament and had legislative 
immunity against prosecution. French law doesn't permit the extradition 
of French citizens, so LePen would have to voluntarily attend a trial 
in Germany. Before the parliament's vote, LePen said a prosecution 
would violate his right to freedom of speech.
