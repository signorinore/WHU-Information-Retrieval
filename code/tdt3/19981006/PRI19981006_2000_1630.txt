President Clinton says it's time for urgent steps to stop the global 
economic crisis from spreading. I'm Richard Griffis at the New York 
business desk. The president told a gathering of the International 
Monetary Fund and World Bank today that the world's leading nations 
must act together to end the current international crisis. Mr. Clinton 
didn't outline specific policy proposals but opted, instead, to stress 
the importance of coordinated action, calling on Japan in particular 
to do its part to restore global stability. Just as the United States 
had to eliminate its deficits and high interest rates, which were 
taking money away from the rest of the world over the last six years, 
now Japan must take strong steps to restart its economic growth by 
addressing problems in the banking system so that lending and investment 
can begin with renewed energy and by stimulating, deregulating and 
opening its economy. For all of us, there can be no substitute for 
action.
