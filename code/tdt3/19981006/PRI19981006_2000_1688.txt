Well, in Japan today, the government admitted what everyone else already 
knew -- that the nation is in the deepest and longest recession since 
the end of the second world war. That came as little surprise to global 
markets, which staged something of a recovery. But economist Gary 
Huffbar says what's needed now is more concrete action rather than 
words to solve the international crisis. What the markets are looking 
for is the color of the money. They want to see the money. They don't 
want to hear anymore of these speeches. Already, even several weeks 
ago, when President Clinton spoke in New York, there was a lot of 
skepticism, and it's just thicker now.
