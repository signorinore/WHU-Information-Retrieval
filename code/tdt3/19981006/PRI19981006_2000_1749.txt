We'll have more on President Clinton's speech on the global economy 
later in the program. You're listening to "The World," and you can 
join us online at www.theworld.org. I'm Tony Kahn. Ahead on "The World," 
in the global economic crisis, Hong Kong, Russia and Brazil are bit 
players. The real action, says one analyst, is in Tokyo. There was 
a week in late August where the Japanese market shed more value in 
a week than the Russian economy generates in a year. Also ahead, foreign 
students on America's "Monica-mania." First up, this news. For "The 
World," National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm A Taylor.
