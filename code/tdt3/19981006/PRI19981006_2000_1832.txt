President Clinton has warned Belgrade NATO is poised to intervene 
if the conflict in Kosovo is not resolved. American special envoy 
Richard Holbrooke has met with the Yugoslav president for a second 
day. From the capital of Kosovo, Pristina, Paul Wood reports. The 
statement by Richard Holbrooke that Belgrade is still not in compliance 
with UN resolutions and the robust language employed by President 
Clinton seem to imply that air strikes are closer than ever before. 
During his shuttle mission, Mr. Holbrooke received a briefing which 
said that while the Yugoslav army has been withdrawing, special police 
forces remain. It's not an assessment shared by all Western diplomats 
here. But Mr. Holbrooke has been warning President Milosevic of the 
seriousness of the West's resolve to use force if necessary. Paul 
Wood, BBC News, Pristina.
