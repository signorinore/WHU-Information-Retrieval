In New York, the UN Security Council is debating the crisis in Kosovo. 
Western nations are not expected to press for any new resolution sanctioning 
military action against Belgrade since Russia has already said it 
would veto such a move. The new Russian prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, 
has called for stability and discipline on the eve of planned mass 
protests over the economic crisis. The BBC's Alan Little has the details. 
In a televised address to the nation, Mr. Primakov said he understood 
why many people felt the need to demonstrate, but he added, "I want 
to urge everyone not to rock the boat we are all in. The sea today 
is too stormy." The opposition have called a day of protests across 
Russia on Wednesday. They say millions will take to the streets. Mr. 
Primakov promised that members of the armed forces and millions of 
state pensioners would be paid this month. He sought to reassure the 
country that it would not go hungry this winter. Agreements have been 
reached with Belarus and Ukraine according to which the debts they 
owe Russia would be paid in part in agricultural produce, particularly 
potatoes. Alan Little reporting from Moscow.
