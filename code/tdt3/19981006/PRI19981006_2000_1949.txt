Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is in the Middle East to revive 
the peace process. She will hold a three-way meeting tomorrow with 
the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat. She said much work needs to be done to achieve a deal. 
I think we all know that time is not on our side, and if we don't 
move quickly, we may find ourselves without a process of peace-making, 
without an agreement and without the hope of achieving an Israeli-Palestinian 
peace. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
