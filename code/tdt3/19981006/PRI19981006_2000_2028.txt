In Washington today, President Clinton opened the annual meeting of 
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank with a sober assessment 
of the state of the world economy. Today, said the president, the 
world faces perhaps its most serious financial crisis in half a century. 
Mr. Clinton appealed to Japan to address problems in its banking system 
and then to lawmakers in his own country. Also, the United States 
must -- must meet our obligations to the IMF. I have told Congress 
we can debate how to reform the operations of the fire department, 
but there is no excuse for refusing to supply the fire department 
with water while the fire is burning.
