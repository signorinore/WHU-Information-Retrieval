Today's geography quiz takes us north of the lower 48 to a heritage 
park shared by Alaska and British Columbia. Its history goes back 
hundreds of years. Originally a trade route for local natives, a century 
ago it attracted thousands of gold seekers who came here during the 
gold rush. The route to the Klondike begins right here at the Chilkoot 
Trail. This 33-mile path culminates in the so-called "golden stairs," 
a steep pitch that rises up some 3,600 feet. During the heyday of 
the gold rush, many gold diggers left various belongings along the 
trail, and nowadays, these are considered precious artifacts. Some 
of them are even housed in a museum in nearby Skagway, Alaska. Even 
now our mystery park continues to attract people, not in search of 
gold, but in search of a nice hike and a bit of gold-mining history. 
We'll bring you the name of our mystery park in just a second.
