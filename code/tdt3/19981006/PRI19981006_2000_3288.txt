A disc jockey used to be someone who selected recorded music and then 
played it. Well, nowadays, a deejay is something else. In the United 
States, hip hop deejays improvise poetry over records which they carefully 
program for dance sets. In Jamaica, deejays improvise their raps or 
toasts over simpler rhythms from Jamaican music. And now, the Jamaican 
deejay style is spreading to France, as "The World's" Marco Orreman 
explains. If you think that Ragasonic's little spoken interludes are 
confusing, the music sung in French is bound to leave you babbling. 
The French duet, inspired by Jamaican raga, has shot out of the Paris 
underground and achieved an eager following since the release of its 
second album, Ragasonic II. This is not reggae. This is raga. In the 
'70s, young Jamaican deejays in Kingston's nightclubs found themselves 
not just spinning disks but challenging each other how well they could 
toast over them. The themes were violence, sex and drugs and reflected 
little of the spirituality found in early reggae. This track by Paris-based 
Ragasonic, "Alcolu", is a step up on the lyrical evolutionary ladder 
from raga singers from the '80s. "Alcolu" is a warning to heavy drinkers 
of the risks they run. In France, the world's highest per capita consumer 
of alcohol, people are likely to listen up. Some ragamuffins -- that's 
the fans of raga music -- listen for the dance hall beat and the message. 
Others simply use raga as a bubbly soundtrack for marijuana consumption. 
In this song, Ragasonic sends a flair out to those who aren't paying 
attention to their lyrics. It's called "Poupon Le Pon Le Pou En And" 
-- "Don't Treat Me Like An Ass." For "The World," this is Marco Orreman. 
Raga rhythms, au francais, no less -- from Paris-based Ragasonic brings 
this edition of "The World" to a close.
