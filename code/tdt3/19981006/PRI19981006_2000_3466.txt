We're online 24 hours a day at www.theworld.org. In Boston, I'm Tony 
Kahn. Join us again tomorrow for another spin of "The World." "The 
World" is a co-production of the BBC World Service, Public Radio International 
and WGBH Boston and is made possible in part by the PRI Program Fund, 
whose contributors include the Ford Foundation, the John D. and Katherine 
T. MacArthur Foundation and the Teresa and H. John Heinz III Foundation.
