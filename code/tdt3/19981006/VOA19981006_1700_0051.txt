I'm Robert Burns, VOA NEWS. President Clinton says Serbia's Kosovo 
Province is becoming a powder keg in the Balkans. And he warns violence 
there could spread to neighboring countries. Using tough language, 
the President said Yugoslav President Yogovlan Moglosovich is primarily 
to blame for the crisis. He insisted Yugoslavia must accept U.N. demands 
for a cease fire or face NATO air strikes. Mr. Clinton warns of a 
pending humanitarian catastrophe with hundreds of thousands forced 
from their homes. He says more than 50 thousand people without shelter 
are facing the risk of freezing to death over the winter.
