On another matter, President Clinton has told the world economic and 
business leaders it's time for urgent steps to prevent the global 
economic crisis from spreading. VOA's David Gullis reports from the 
White House. Mr. Clinton told the annual meeting of the World Bank 
and International Monetary Fund that the current crisis is the worst 
in half a century. And every county will be effected unless there 
is decisive action. In a wide-ranging address, he urged reforms to 
deal with the contagious capital outflows that have ravaged the economies 
of countries in Asia and elsewhere. Even those that have been well-managed. 
He reiterated appeals to Japan to restart its economic growth and 
clean up its banking system. And he said the U.S. Congress must approve 
a long delayed replenishment of the IMF, which he cast as an global 
economic fire brigade. I have told Congress: We can debate how to 
reform the operations of the fire department. But there is no excuse 
for refusing to supply the fire department with water while the fire 
is burning. A Clinton spokesman earlier called Congressional stalling 
on the IMF money: reckless and inexcusable. David Gullis, VOA NEWS, 
the White House.
