On Capitol Hill, the Republican majority in the House has scheduled 
a vote Thursday on whether to launch a formal impeachment inquiry 
of President Clinton. The House is expected to give final approval 
to a Republican plan for broad, open-ended impeachment hearings. It 
would be only the third impeachment inquiry of a U.S. President. Monday, 
the House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to launch an 
inquiry. The White House spokesman denounced the process, calling 
it unfair. And called it a partisan move to embarrass the President. 
Mr. Clinton is accused of lying under oath, and other crimes in trying 
to conceal his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
