Turkey's Prime Minister, Massut Heilmas has given what he calls a 
final warning to Syria to stop supporting Kurdish rebels. The warning 
came as Egypt's President Josne Nevarik pursued a diplomatic bid to 
diffuse tensions. He flew to Syria after meeting with Turkey's president 
in Ankara. Syria denies providing support or shelter to the rebels, 
who have waged a 14 year war for Kurdish self-rule in Southeastern 
Turkey.
