Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has held extensive talks in 
Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And in Jericho 
with Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat. She's trying to resolve the 
remaining issues prior to a summit later this month, here in Washington. 
As Albright will meet again with both sides early Wednesday, on the 
border between Israel and Gaza. Correspondent Gil Butler has more 
in this report. Secretary Albright traveled by motorcade from Jerusalem, 
where she had held extensive talks with Israel's Prime Minister. To 
below sea-level Jericho, an oasis of the desert east of Jerusalem, 
to meet Yasir Arafat and other Palestinian leaders. And we hope that 
this visit by Secretary Albright would be a continuation of the American 
efforts. And also will be a prelude to settle all the remaining issues. 
Time is not on the side of the negotiators unless they move quickly. 
They could, in her words, find themselves without the hope of achieving 
an Israeli-Palestinian peace. Gil Butler, VOA NEWS, Jerusalem.
