Russian Prime Minister Yugemi Primacof is promising millions of soldier, 
civil servants and pensioners they will get their paychecks. The prime 
minister addressed the nation on the eve of nationwide protests against 
the Russian government's failure to pay back wages. He implored Russians 
to stay calm as they planned to take to the streets in Russia in the 
economic crisis. He said the ability to pay for a plan depends on 
predators such as the International Monetary Fund.
