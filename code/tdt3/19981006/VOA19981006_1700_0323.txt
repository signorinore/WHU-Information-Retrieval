Rebels in Congo, Conshasa say they have entered the country's eastern 
headquarters' town and are fighting what could be a decisive battle 
in Congo's civil war. The rebel commander says two thousand fighters 
went in to Kendu early Tuesday. He says 18 government soldiers have 
been killed in fighting, and another 44 captured. At least one rebel 
was wounded. And that's the latest. I'm Robert Burns, VOA NEWS.
