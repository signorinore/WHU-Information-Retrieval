As Richard Hallbrook attempts to broker a Kosovo peace accord, Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright is also on the road trying her hand at 
reconciliation. This time, in the Middle East. Secretary Albright 
says Israelis and Palestinians have difficult choices to make before 
a Washington summit with President Clinton this month. Ms. Albright 
met with Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat in the West Bank town of 
Jericho after talks in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu. Mr. Netanyahu later said Israel has agreed to give up more 
West Bank land. And is waiting for additional security guarantees 
from the Palestinians. I can say, categorically, that if the Palestinians 
do their part, we shall do our part. And we shall have an agreement. 
That is why I think in many ways, having that reassurance from the 
Palestinian authority would, I think, increase significantly the chances 
of the success and the conclusion of a successful agreement. Which 
is what we desire. I know what the United States desires, and I believe 
the majority of the Palestinian people desire as well. Secretary Albright 
met with Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat in New York and Washington last 
week. And said those talks created a positive atmosphere for Tuesday's 
discussions. There really is a unique opportunity to reach an agreement 
on interim issues. So that the Israelis and Palestinians can restore 
their partnerships, rekindle the hope for peace. And create an environment 
in which they can address the critical issues in the permanent status 
negotiations. Now, I think we all know that time is not on our side. 
And if we don't move quickly, we may find ourselves without a process 
of peacemaking. Without an agreement, and without the hope of achieving 
an Israeli-Palestinian peace. Ms. Albright arrived in Israel early 
Tuesday. To pave the way for the mid-October Israeli-Palestinian summit 
with President Clinton, here in Washington.
