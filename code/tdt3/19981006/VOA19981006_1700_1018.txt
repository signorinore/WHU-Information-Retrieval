And in this country. In Pennsylvania, two Amish men face five to forty 
years in prison. After pleading guilty to conspiring to sell cocaine 
to fellow members of their insular religious sect, the Old Order Amish. 
Abner Stoltiz and Abner King Stoltiz, who are not related, entered 
their pleas in the Philadelphia court. No sentencing date was set. 
In what is to be believed the first drug trade case in the Amish community, 
the two young men were charged with buying cocaine from a Philadelphia 
motorcycle gang and selling it to Amish youth. Eight members of the 
gang were also charged. The case has thrown a media spotlight on how 
modern day problems are encroaching on the simple Amish way of life.
