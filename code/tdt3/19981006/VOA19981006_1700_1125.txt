Time now for sports. And joining us here in the studio with the latest 
details, is VOA Steve Shies. Steve? Thank you, Susan. A training session 
for France's football team was interrupted Tuesday. As French sports 
ministry officials chose four players to undergo random drug testing. 
French Football Federation's spokesman Phillipe Terrand said on Tuesday, 
the four players, who were not identified for reasons of confidentiality, 
gave urine samples. The tests caused a delay in practice of about 
30 minutes. The French team is preparing for its European championship 
qualifier against Russia. Which will be played on October 10. It was 
the second time in 9 months authorities have visited the French training 
camp to conduct doping tests. Last December, four players had their 
urine checked. But the results were negative.
