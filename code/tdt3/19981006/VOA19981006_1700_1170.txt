The executive committee of European football's governing body has 
decided to merge the Cupwinner's Cup with the UAFA Cup and enlarge 
the Champions League. UAFA President Leonard Johannsen said Tuesday 
in Lisbon, that the number of teams in the Champions League will increase 
from 24 to 32 in the 2000 - 2001 season. That same year, the Cupwinner's 
Cup will merge with the UAFA cup. And the combined tournament will 
be called the UAFA Cup. The changes come in response to pressure from 
leading European teams to overhaul the club competitions. Several 
of the top clubs, including Manchester United Arsenal in Liverpool, 
have held discussions with Media Partners International regarding 
joining a new European "super league."
