Well, the Major League baseball playoffs continue tonight. When the 
New York Yankees host the Cleveland Indians in the American League 
Championship series. The Yankees will be looking to avenge last year's 
divisional playoff loss to the Indians. New York will start pitcher 
David Wells, while Cleveland will send Jared Right to the mound. Yankees 
manager Joe Torre says the Indians are confident, and will give his 
team a tough challenge. Their club, who's had success over the last, 
you know, three or four years. So, I think the success factor has 
added to their confidence. They're a pretty much a veteran ball club. 
That have a lot of confidence in themselves. The Yankees have not 
played since sweeping the Texas Rangers in division playoffs last 
Friday. Cleveland had to go four games with the Boston Red Sox. The 
National League championship series between the Atlanta Braves and 
San Diego Padres will begin Wednesday night in Atlanta.
