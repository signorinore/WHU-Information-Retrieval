Goreny Nevesinich overcame jet lag and New Zealand's Brett Steven 
to reach the second round of the Shanghai Open Tennis Tournament in 
China, Tuesday. From the Chinese Port City, David Luddy reports that 
crowd favorite Michael Chang, also advanced. Under a full moon in 
cold conditions, Chang, now world rank 33, defeated the Canadian Sebastian 
Laroue six-three, seven-six. He next played Italian Lawrence Teileman. 
Meanwhile, Nevensinich world rank 12, beat Kiwi Brett Steven, seven-six, 
six-four. An accounting hitting battle in this Heineken Open, his 
rapier serves and drives from both flanks won the day. Watched by 
four hundred excited children, smartly dressed in white tops and blue 
trousers and skirts. Nevensinich now takes on 21 year old American 
Justin Gimmelstof, who's just completed two years of a degree at UCLA. 
It will take more than a brain to beat the powerful Croatian. David 
Luddy, for VOA, in Shanghai.
