Meanwhile, German tennis player Nicholas Keifer has knocked Australian 
Open Winner in two and third seated Peter Korder of the Czech Republic 
out of the Swiss Indoors Tournament in Basil. Keifer, who is ranked 
32nd in the world, needed only an hour and 17 minutes to dispose of 
Korder's six-two, six-four. Afterwards, Keifer said he had trained 
very hard for the past three weeks, and found it very satisfying to 
beat the fifth ranked player in the world. In other first round matches 
on Tuesday, fifth seated Yuginick Kethelmakof of Russia defeated Sweden's 
Magnus Norman. And sixth seat Tim Hendmann of Britain came back to 
eliminate Australian Jason Staltenberg in three sets.
