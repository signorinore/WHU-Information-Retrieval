That sounds like good morning music there. And with that in mind, 
A U.S. government study has found the main source of vitamins and 
minerals for American children is breakfast cereal. The new study 
says American kids are eating fortified cereal instead of fruits and 
vegetables. Which contain fiber and nutrients, as well as cancer-fighting 
substances. The author of the study, nutritionist Amy Suvar with the 
National Cancer Institute says the problem is not that cereal is unhealthy. 
Actually fortified cereal is considered very nutritious. But cereals, 
she says, should not be the sole source of nutrition for children. 
Health professionals suggest parents encourage their youngsters to 
eat cereal with fruit, or have a glass of juice. The findings are 
published in the October issue of Pediatrics, a professional journal 
of the American Academy of Pediatrics. And I don't know about you, 
Susan, but my mother always said breakfast was the most important 
meal of the day.
