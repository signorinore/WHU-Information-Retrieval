I'm Les Carpenter, VOA NEWS. Using tough language, President Clinton 
has again insisted that Yugoslavia must accept U.N. demands for a 
cease fire or face NATO air strikes. And he laid blame for the crisis 
in Kosovo on Yugoslav President Slobodon Mulochovich. Mr. Clinton 
said the violence must stop. We all agree that Kosovo is a powder 
keg in the Balkans. If the violence continues, it could spill over 
and threaten the peace and stability of Bosnia and Albania, Macedonia, 
and other countries in the region. What is already a humanitarian 
crisis, could turn into a catastrophe. President Clinton says more 
than 50 thousand people without shelter are facing the risk of freezing 
to death in winter.
