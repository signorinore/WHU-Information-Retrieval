The full U.S. House of Representatives is preparing for an historic 
vote Thursday on whether to launch impeachment proceedings against 
President Clinton. VOA's Paula Wolfson reports majority of Republicans 
plan to push through a call for open-ended hearings. The recommendation 
cleared the House Judiciary Committee late Monday on a straight party 
line vote. But Republicans hope they can get at least several dozen 
Democrats to vote with them in the full House. They will not get Democrat 
Nita Lowey of New York. Who has long been a crusader for women's rights 
in the legislature. The President's actions, while reprehensible, 
are not impeachable. And do not merit further hearings. The White 
House is hoping all Democrats will vote no. But a few members from 
more conservative districts have indicated they will support the Republican 
plan for an unrestricted impeachment inquiry. Paula Wolfson, VOA NEWS, 
Capitol Hill.
