U.S. Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright will hold three-way talks 
with Israeli and Palestinian leaders early Wednesday in the Gaza Strip 
Border. Both sides already agree Israel will give up another 13 percent 
of the West Bank. But Palestinians say they want details on exactly 
what land will change hands. Israel says it wants the details behind 
Palestinian pledges to bottle up anti-Israeli Islamic militants. U.S. 
officials say they do not expect a deal on Israel's West Bank pullout 
to be finalized at the Wednesday morning border meeting. But Ms. Albright 
says time is becoming important. We all know that time is not on our 
side. And if we don't move quickly, we may find ourselves without 
a process of peacemaking. Without an agreement. And without the hope 
of achieving an Israeli-Palestinian peace. Ms. Albright is laying 
the groundwork ahead of the three-way meeting in Washington in about 
10 days.
