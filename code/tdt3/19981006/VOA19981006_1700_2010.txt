Turkey's Prime Minister has given what he calls a final warning to 
Syria to stop supporting Kurdish rebels. The warning came as Egypt's 
president pursued a diplomatic bid to diffuse tensions, meeting with 
the Turkish president in Ankara. Syria denies providing support or 
shelter to the rebels, who have waged a 14 year war for Kurdish self-rule 
in Southeastern Turkey.
