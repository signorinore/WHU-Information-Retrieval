Russian Prime Minister, Yugemi Primacof has appealed for calm just 
hours before protests are to begin throughout the country. In Moscow, 
VOA's Andrea Denesha has details. In a televised address, Prime Minister 
Primacof said the only way out of the current economic and financial 
crisis is for Russians to show calm, be disciplined, and obey the 
constitution and current laws. Mr Primacof said "I understand that 
many Russians who will demonstrate have grounds for dissatisfaction." 
But he urged them in his words "not to rock the boat in today's very 
stormy sea." The Russian Prime Minister's televised address came on 
the eve of nationwide demonstrations planned by trade unions and the 
Russian communist party. Organizers expect millions to come out and 
voice their criticism of President Boris Yeltsin. Communists and trade 
unions say the protest throughout Russia will be peaceful. But, nevertheless, 
police and Interior Ministry troops have been placed on alert to prevent 
any mass disturbances. Andre Denesha, VOA NEWS, Moscow.
