Rebels in Congo Conshasa say they have entered the government's eastern 
stronghold. And are fighting what could be a decisive battle in Congo's 
civil war. Rebel Commander Arthur Mununda says two thousand fighters 
went into Kendu on Tuesday. There was no independent confirmation 
of the fighting and no comment from the government.
