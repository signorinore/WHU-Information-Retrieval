The world's two main financial lending institutions are holding their 
joint annual meeting here in Washington this week. This year their 
discussions are widely seen as more urgent: How to ward off a global 
economic recession. The World Bank and the International Monetary 
Fund, the IMF, have been criticized for policies which some say have 
contributed to the current Asian and Russian economic crises. Averting 
global recession is the subject of today's Dateline. Here's Pamela 
Taylor. Economists attending the annual meeting of the World Bank 
and IMF have welcomed the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank's decision last 
month to cut interest rates by a quarter of one percentage point. 
And to consider further cuts, if necessary. Federal Reserve Chairman, 
Alan Greenspan told a Senate budget committee last week; there are 
few signs the financial crisis which began in Asia last year have 
subsided. Or will do so soon. It is just not credible that the United 
States, or for that matter, Europe, can remain an oasis of prosperity. 
Unaffected by a world that is experiencing greatly increased stress. 
Mr. Greenspan's remarks were not well received by both Wall Street 
and the world markets, which wanted a larger interest rate cut. Global 
markets are looking for a coordinated interest rate reduction among 
richer nations. To allow credit and capital to flow more freely. In 
its annual world economic forecast released last week, the IMF predicted 
the global economy will grow by only two percent this year, if that. 
As a prelude to this week's World Bank/IMF meeting, finance ministers 
and central bank chiefs from the seven richest nations gathered in 
Washington to discuss the possibility of increased regulation of the 
global financial system. Various proposals for reforming international 
lending institutions were also discussed. But little is expected to 
emerge in the form of concrete prescriptions.
