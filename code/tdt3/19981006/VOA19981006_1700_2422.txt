In it's world economic outlook, the IMF said that in the month of 
August, Russia replaced Asia as the epicenter of global financial 
market pressure. As a consequence, both the World Bank and the IMF 
now say they may have to withdraw from promises to lend Russia more 
money this year. Misuse of past loans by Russian officials is given, 
as one reason behind international reluctance to further bail out 
Russia's ailing economy. But on Monday, First Deputy Prime Minister 
Yuri Masleocof said the International Monetary Fund helped fuel Russia's 
economic turmoil. And he expects the group to help halt Russia's downward 
spiral. We have more in this report from Moscow correspondent, Peter 
Heinlein. First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Masleocof says the IMF 
helped Russia get into its current financial crisis and must help 
it get out. He said: "We did not fall into this pit all by ourselves. 
It was also thanks to the skillful help of our partners from the IMF." 
He said: "So there is only one path. We must be helped, and we demand 
this help." He said the next 4.3 billion dollar IMF loan installment 
is needed because Russia does not have enough money to bail itself 
out of its current economic crisis on its own. But the lending agency 
has made it clear the next loan installment would only be released 
after Russia comes up with a firm commitment to continue on the path 
of reform. Mr. Mosleocof, a former top Soviet economic official, had 
earlier indicated a preference for tighter state controls. Some reports 
had said the government was considering a plan to limit the circulation 
of dollars. Something that worried Russian and foreign business leaders. 
But Mr. Mosleocof called that idea rubbish. He said: "On the contrary. 
The more dollars people bring into Russia, the better." He told the 
audience: "Please, feel free to use dollars as you see fit." He reiterated 
the statements of other government officials, that despite their Soviet 
past, they have no plan to return to a Soviet Style.. We seem to have 
a technical problem with the end our Dateline report.
