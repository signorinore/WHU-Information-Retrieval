Analysts say there's still a lot of nervousness on Wall Street about 
global financial conditions. There was also some frustration that 
leaders of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank did 
not develop a comprehensive solution to world economic problems at 
their meeting in Washington. At that meeting, President Clinton urged 
policy makers in every nation to promote economic growth. He said 
urgent steps are needed to stop the global economic crisis from spreading.
