Many of our local and FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a two minute break. This is VOA NEWS NOW. That hard driving music 
means it's coming up on 22 hours, Universal time. It also means that 
we're saying goodnight to most of our listeners in the Middle East 
and in North Africa. Thanks for being with us. And tune in again tomorrow 
beginning at 4 hours, Universal time when VOA NEWS NOW resumes on 
7.17, 11.965, and 15.205 megahertz short wave. If you're listening 
in the Persian Gulf area right now, we invite you to stay with us 
for another couple of hours on medium wave at 1548 kilohertz. And 
if you're listening in the Eastern Mediterranean, we'll be back on 
the air with VOA NEWS NOW, 30 minutes from now on 1260 kilohertz medium 
wave. Here's the frequency change if you're listening in Africa. We 
are now going off 15.41, 15.445, 15.58, and 17.725 megahertz short 
wave. We invite you to retune to 7.34 megahertz, or any of our other 
remaining frequencies. Well, listeners in Europe, we're now going 
off WRN1 Via Astra. We'll resume broadcasting
