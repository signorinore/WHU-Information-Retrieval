President Clinton warns of spreading violence and a potential humanitarian 
catastrophe in Kosovo. With the threat of NATO air raids hanging over 
Yugoslavia, residents of the Serbian capital expressed their opinions 
on the situation to our correspondent on Belgrade. At a meeting of 
the IMF and the World Bank, President Clinton appeals for urgent action 
to halt the worsening global financial crisis. And foreign citizens 
who want to live and work legally here in the United States will soon 
have to pay more money for green cards. I'm Tony Riggs. I'm Teresa 
Erickson. We'll have details on those stories, sports, business news 
and more on the controversial pioneering aviator, Charles Lindbergh. 
It's all ahead in this hour. VOA News Now. First, a summary of world 
news. I'm Robert Burns, VOA News.
