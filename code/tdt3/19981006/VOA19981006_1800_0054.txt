President Clinton says Serbia's Kosovo Province is becoming a powder 
keg in the Balkans and he warns violence there could spread to nearby 
countries. Using tough language, Mr. Clinton said Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic is primarily to blame for the crisis. He insisted 
Yugoslavia must accept UN demands for a cease fire or face NATO air 
strikes. The threat of air strikes sparked sharp questions for U.S. 
military leaders at a Senate hearing Tuesday. Many senators support 
the air attacks but several also worry that U.S. ground troops will 
have to follow the American airplanes into the troubled Serbian Province. 
VOA's Jim Randle reports from Capital Hill. Members of the Senate 
Arms Services Committee say if diplomacy of air strikes bring a cease 
fire to Kosovo, foreign troops will be needed to enforce it and to 
ensure humanitarian aid deliveries. Senators complained similar U.S. 
troop commitments to enforce the peace in Bosnia have gone on far 
longer and cost billions of dollars more than expected. Secretary 
of Defense William Cohen says, European troops will have to do any 
peacekeeping needed in Kosovo. That if a ground component is required, 
it is my recommendation and I would almost say insistence that it 
be largely if not wholly European in nature, given the fact that we 
have and will be carrying the bulk of the load as far as the air is 
concerned. Secretary Cohen has said air strikes against Yugoslav military 
targets in Kosovo and elsewhere could come within two weeks and involve 
hundreds of aircraft from across the NATO alliance. Tuesday, the United 
States took one more formal step toward air strikes by telling NATO 
commanders exactly which planes will be available for the proposed 
attacks. Jim Randle, VOA News, Capital Hill.
