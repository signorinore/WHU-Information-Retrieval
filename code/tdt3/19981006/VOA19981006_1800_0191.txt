The Republican majority in the House of Representatives has scheduled 
a vote this coming Thursday on whether to launch a formal impeachment 
inquiry of President Clinton. The House is expected to give final 
approval to a Republican plan for broad open ended impeachment hearings. 
It would be only the third impeachment inquiry of a U.S. president.
