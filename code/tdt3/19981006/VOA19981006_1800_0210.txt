Secretary of State Madeline Albright will hold three weeks -- three-way 
talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders early Wednesday on the 
Gaza Strip border. Both sides already agree that Israel will give 
up another 13 percent of the West Bank, but Palestinians say they 
want details on exactly what land will change hands. Israel says it 
wants the details behind Palestinian pledges to bottle up anti-Israeli 
Islamic militants. Israeli and Palestinian leaders will meet with 
President Clinton in Washington in about ten days.
