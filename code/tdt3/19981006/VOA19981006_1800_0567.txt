President Clinton is appealing for urgent action to halt the worsening 
global financial crisis. He made his comments at a meeting of the 
World Bank and International Monetary Fund here in Washington, Tuesday. 
VOA's Deborah Tate reports from the White House. Mr. Clinton called 
for a coordinated approach to restore confidence and stability to 
the global economy although he offered no concrete proposals. The 
central economic challenge we face is to harness the positive power 
of an open international economy while avoiding the cycle of boom 
and bust that diminishes hope and destroys wealth. And the central 
political challenge we face is to build a system that strengthens 
social protections and Democratic institutions so that people everywhere 
can actually reap the rewards of growth. Mr. Clinton appealed to Europe 
to move forward with growth oriented economic policies and keep its 
markets open and he said Japan must do its part as well. The health 
of Asia and indeed the world depends upon Japan, just as the United 
States had to eliminate its deficits and high interest rates which 
were taking money away from the rest of the world over the last six 
years. Now Japan must take strong steps to restart its economic growth 
by addressing problems in the banking system so that lending and investment 
can begin with renewed energy and by stimulating, deregulating and 
opening its economy. Mr. Clinton repeated his call to Congress to 
pass his request for an additional $18 billion for the IMF which has 
had its resources severely depleted following bailouts of economies 
in Asia and Russia. Although the Senate has passed the package, the 
House has refused to do so until the IMF implements reforms. Deborah 
Tate, VOA News at the White House.
