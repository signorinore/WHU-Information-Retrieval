Foreign citizens who want to live and work legally here in the United 
States will soon have to pay more money to secure permits known as 
green cards from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
Beginning next Tuesday, fees will increase for all immigration benefits 
and services except citizenship. VOA's Michael Bowman reports from 
Miami. Recent arrivals in the United States as well as advocacy groups 
for immigrants are denouncing the hike in fees. The Immigration and 
Naturalization Service says the fee to register as a permanent resident 
will go up from $130 to $220. Applying for naturalization will cost 
$225, up from $95. Those applying for re-admission to the United States 
after deportation will be charged $170 instead of $95. In a statement, 
the INS says the new revenue generated from the augmented fees will 
be utilized to overhaul and improve the services the agency provides 
to immigrants. The INS says fees have not increased since 1994 and 
that processing costs currently exceed revenue by nearly $17 million 
a month. The INS says the budgetary shortfall has forced the agency 
to delay much needed reforms and improvements in its handling of immigration 
cases. In Miami, the hike the fees is provoking an outcry from those 
who work on behalf of immigrants. Franklin Chavez is director of an 
organization known as Latin American Immigration Community Service. 
Mr. Chavez says the INS action will greatly burden Central American 
and Cuban immigrants, the vast majority of whom have extremely limited 
financial resources. The U.S. government look like they see a sign 
of dollars in the immigrants and I think it's completely outrageous. 
So a lot of people not going to apply at all. Why? Because they don't 
have the money. Mr. Chavez says noncompliance with U.S. immigration 
law is already rampant and will only worsen once processing fees go 
up. Michael Bowman, VOA News, Miami.
