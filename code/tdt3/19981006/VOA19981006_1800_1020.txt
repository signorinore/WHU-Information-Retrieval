You're tuned to the Voice of America, coming to you from Washington. 
I'm Tony Riggs with Teresa Erickson bringing you this hour of VOA 
News Now. And it's 22:18 universal time. Here's the major news story 
we're following this hour. President Clinton, in some of his strongest 
language yet, says Serbia's Kosovo Province is becoming a powder keg 
in the Balkans. We'll have details on that story in our next world 
news summary. Well, it's time now for sports and joining us here in 
the studio with the very latest is VOA's Steve Shive. Thank you, Tony.
