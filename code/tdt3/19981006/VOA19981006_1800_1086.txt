The major league baseball playoffs resume in less than two hours with 
the Cleveland Indians in New York to face the Yankees in game one 
of the best of seven American League championship series. Pitching 
ace David Wells will throw from the mound for the Yankees. Wells notched 
another victory in game one of the Yankee's previous series against 
the Texas Rangers. He has surrendered just one earn run in 17 post-season 
innings as a Yankee. Jared Wright will start for Cleveland. His first 
game in the series against the Boston Red Sox was a disaster as he 
gave up two three run home runs. Wright is trying hard to put that 
disappointing loss behind him. To me that's over. That's in the past. 
I know what I have to do to -- you know, to pitch tomorrow and so 
no, I'm not going to talk. Yankee manager Joe Torre is juggling his 
lineup a bit as New York tries to cap a great season with 114 victories 
with a trip to the World Series. The Indians want to get back to the 
fall classic as well and are putting hard hitting David Justice, the 
team's designated hitter for most of the season, in left field. Now 
on Wednesday, the San Diego Padres opened the National League championship 
series against Atlanta. The Braves are appearing in their seventh 
straight NLCS. Atlanta skipper Bobby Cox is happy his pitchers begin 
the series well rested. But he says, it really doesn't matter. The 
first three guys out -- are going to have six days rest, Mulch, Glavine 
and Maddux. They'll all have six days. A lot of these guys can pitch 
on two days rest. I don't think it makes that much difference. The 
adrenaline really gets going. The Padres have returned to the National 
League Championship Series for the first time since 1984.
