The owner of the National Football League's San Francisco 49ers has 
pleaded guilty in Federal Court to failing to report a crime that 
had been committed. Eddie DeBartelo, Jr. pleaded guilty in Baton Rouge, 
Tuesday, to failing to report an alleged extortion scheme that involved 
former Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards. As part of a plea agreement, 
DeBartelo was placed on probation for two years and will pay a total 
of $1 million in penalties and fines. The 49er's owner was under investigation 
for allegedly paying Edwards $400,000 for help in getting a riverboat 
casino license last year. DeBartelo has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors 
in any future trials against Edwards and his son for their roles in 
the State's riverboat casino industry. Well, it doesn't happen often 
in the National Football League and especially at Lambeau Field. The 
Green Bay Packers not only lost a home game, the Minnesota Vikings 
came up with a big 37/24 route in a nationally televised Monday night 
game. Both the NFC Central Division rivals were undefeated going into 
the contest which was played in a steady downpour. Minnesota quarterback 
Randall Cunningham came up with several big pass plays, including 
two long touchdown strikes to Randy Moss and one to Jake Reed. Moss 
says the Vikings knew they had obstacles to overcome. I knew the crowd 
was going to be a little hostile, a little cranky and we just had 
to go ahead and just push it down their throats when we had the opportunity 
so we just took advantage of our opportunity tonight.
