On the other side of the ball, the Vikings defense shut down Green 
Bays' attempts to get back into the game. Packer quarterback Brett 
Favre was intercepted three times. The Minnesota victory stops the 
Green Bay home winning streak at 25, two short of the record set in 
the early 1970s by the Miami Dolphins. And speaking of the Vikings, 
their quarterback Randall Cunningham, was named the National Football 
League's Player of the Week. He passed for 442 yards and four touchdowns 
in that game Monday night.
