Finally, South Korea's field hockey team has been invited to compete 
in the Champion's Trophy Tournament in Pakistan after England withdrew 
from the event for security reasons. The International Hockey Federation 
said Tuesday it hopes to have confirmation of participation from South 
Korea by the end of the week. The South Korean team was invited because 
it was the next highest ranked team after England in the 1998 World 
Cup.
