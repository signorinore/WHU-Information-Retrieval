The Jewish holiday of Sukkot is being celebrated this week. Centuries 
ago it began as a harvest ceremony which took on historical overtones, 
reminding the Jews of their time wandering the desert during the Exodus. 
An important part of the festivities is the building of a Sukkoh, 
a temporary hut in which the family takes its meals. I'm Jim Metzner 
and this is the Pulse of the Planet presented by the American Museum 
of Natural History. Max Tiktin is Assistant Head of the Judaic Studies 
Program at George Washington University. Surrounded by the sounds 
of family Sukkoh under construction, Max tells us each year's hut 
is a new creation. The kind of Sukkoh that I love best is the one 
that takes a shape that is different from what it was last year, and 
there's always some degree of improvisation. And so, building the 
Sukkoh can and is for many of us a very joyous enterprise in which 
we need kids of all ages and sizes to help bring things together that 
will be part of the Sukkoh and maybe distinctively our Sukkoh this 
year. And then, after it's all up, then we have those walls. What 
are we going to put on the walls? And so, our Sukkoh in our family 
has always included a lot of children's pictures and drawings, a lot 
of things cut out from newspapers and magazines that seem appropriate 
to the change in the seasons and the kids have picked and pasted together 
and then pasted on the wall. And then, the last and most exciting 
thing for kids is we take fruits and we string them up from the roof 
of the Sukkoh so that many of our Sukkohs as you enter them will have 
hanging from the roof pears and apples and clusters of grapes.
