Pulse of the Planet is presented by the American Museum of Natural 
History. I'm Jim Metzner. It's universal time and this is VOA News 
Now. President Clinton calls Kosovo a powder keg, threatening destruction 
in the Balkans. Russia threatens use of its Security Council veto 
to stop NATO action in Kosovo. And talks on the status of East Timor 
reopened at the UN. Those stories plus business news and more in our 
next half hour of VOA News Now. Hello again from Washington. I'm Tony 
Riggs along with Teresa Erickson.
