The divisions in the Balkans echoed in Eastern Europe Tuesday as the 
former Soviet Republics of Ukraine and Belaruse backed opposing sides 
in the standoff with Yugoslavia. Ukraine says it will support NATO 
is push comes to shove. Belaruse says it will back Yugoslavia with 
troops if need be. But NATO's real concern must be with Russia. As 
VOA's Andre Deneshner reports from Moscow, the Kremlin is making clear 
its opposition to any NATO military action in Kosovo. Russian Foreign 
Minister Ygor Yvenau says Moscow will use its veto at the United Nations 
to oppose air strikes against Serb military positions in Kosovo if 
the issue is raised in the Security Council. The Interfacts News Agency 
quoted Mr. Yvenau by saying a military strike will not help stabilize 
the situation there, only aggravate tensions. NATO officials have 
indicated the Western alliances military preparations are virtually 
complete and the time for air strikes is fast approaching. In an interview 
with VOA, senior NATO spokesman Jamie Shea made clear a UN Security 
Council resolution is not needed for air strikes to take place. No, 
we -- our understanding is that a UN Security Council resolution is 
desirable if it can be obtained, but on the other hand, that cannot 
become a block on NATO action if NATO action is urgently required 
to stop the war in Kosovo and to prevent humanitarian catastrophe. 
Mr. Shea said the United Nations has already stated the situation 
in Kosovo is a threat to the region's peace and security and NATO 
already had a clear mandate to use force. NATO will act according 
to international legal standards. That's clear. But the actual legal 
basis is something that will be defined by the allies themselves before 
any action would begin. Meanwhile, the speaker of the Russian Parliament 
Selizniof repeated his strong opposition to any NATO air strikes in 
Kosovo. If air strikes begin, said Mr. Selizniof, the lower House 
will react immediately. We will demand a severance of the agreement 
between Russia and NATO and our relations with this alliance will 
become much more complicated. Mr. Selizniof said NATO air strikes 
will lead to war and Yugoslav forces will inevitably respond by firing 
at NATO planes. Andre Deneshner of VOA News, Moscow.
