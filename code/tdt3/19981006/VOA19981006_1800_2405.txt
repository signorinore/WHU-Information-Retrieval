China says it's worried about missiles, too, but these would be American 
defensive missiles to be deployed eventually as a shield across East 
Asia. As VOA's Roger Wilkison reports from Beijing, China is especially 
concerned that the U.S. Congress wants Taiwan included in the missile 
defense system. The 1999 Defense Appropriations Act is awaiting President 
Clinton's signature, but China wants the Administration to take what 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Du Bong Zal calls effective measures to 
scuttle the clauses Beijing considers offensive. Speaking through 
an interpreter Tuesday at a regular news briefing, Mr. Du says selling 
more arms to Taiwan, and worse yet brining the island under a U.S. 
sponsored theater missile defense system will harm relations between 
Washington and Beijing. That were of China/U.S. relations. This were 
also detrimental to the security and stability of Taiwan and Asia's. 
The Chinese are hereby express our disconcern and strong opposition 
to this. Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a renegade province that 
must be reunited with the mainland has been concerned about Chinese 
military threats ever since Beijing fired medium ranged missiles near 
the island in 1995 and 1996. China believes that a theater missile 
defense system, or TMD for short, will disturb the regional power 
balance in East Asia. Last month, it sharply criticized an agreement 
by the United States and Japans to conduct research on such a system. 
But it is particularly opposed to any move that could strengthen Taiwan's 
defenses. Mr. Du is calling on Washington to abide by the agreements 
that underpin U.S./China relations, especially a 1982 accord that 
says Washington will gradually reduce and eventually eliminate arms 
sales to Taiwan. But in the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, Congress made 
sure that the United States would supply defensive weapons to the 
island. Mr. Du says Washington should not transfer TMD and the relevant 
technology and equipment to Taiwan and should refrain from selling 
the island advanced weapons so as to avoid damage to U.S./China relations.
