Talks on the future of East Timor between Indonesia, which invaded 
and annexed it, and Portugal, which was the colonial power there until 
the 1970s, are underway in New York. VOA's Max Rustin reports, autonomy, 
not independence, appears to be the goal. The talks are the first 
in a series agreed on in early August in a meeting between UN Secretary 
General Kofi Annan and the foreign ministers of Portugal and Indonesia. 
Under that agreement, Indonesia pledged to hold high level talks on 
giving East Timor wide range in autonomy with the aim of reaching 
a formal agreement on the issue before the end of the year. The current 
talks involve a special representative for the UN Secretary General 
and senior diplomats from Indonesia and Portugal. Portugal is representing 
the interests of East Timor which is not independently represented 
in the talks. UN spokesman Fred Eckhard described the agenda for the 
talks. On the agenda are the United Nation's proposals for autonomy 
ad well as the modalities for Portugal and Indonesia to establish 
interest sections in each other's capitals. This round of talks, which 
ends on Thursday, is the first since the ministerial round held in 
New York in August. East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and 
annexed the following year. Since then, there have been regular clashes 
between separatist groups and the Indonesian military. Leading the 
East Timor rights group, the East Timor Action Network, issued a statement 
saying that Indonesia has built up its troops in the territory ahead 
of the talks. There has been no independent confirmation of that claim. 
Indonesia says it has reduced the number of its troops there. Some 
political groups in East Timor have said they will reject any plan 
that does not lead to a referendum on the territories political status. 
Indonesia has rejected the idea of a referendum, saying it will not 
accept any challenge to its sovereignty over the territory. Indonesia 
eased its position on greater autonomy for East Timor, making the 
current talks possible after President Suharto left office earlier 
this year. Max Rustin, VOA News, United Nations.
