Analysts say there's still a lot of nervousness on Wall Street about 
global financial conditions. There was also some frustration that 
leaders of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank did 
not develop a comprehensive solution to world economic problems at 
their meeting in Washington. At that meeting, President Clinton urged 
policy makers in every nation to promote economic growth. He said 
urgent steps are needed to stop the global economic crisis from spreading. 
Breck Ardery, VOA News, New York. President Clinton, addressing world 
financial officials in Washington says, "It's time for decisive action 
on the global economic crisis." The president, one of the opening 
speakers for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund 
and World Bank described the crisis as the most serious in half a 
century. He said international financial systems must be modernized 
and reformed to make them ready for the 21st century. Mr. Clinton 
made his address after releasing more evidence that America was feeling 
the effects of financial troubles elsewhere. A new report from the 
U.S. Treasury Department shows a surge in America's trade deficit, 
with a number of states suffering double digit decreases in their 
exports to Asia. Wall Street economist Irwin Kellner says the figures 
underscore just how global the economy has become. Our industries 
and companies produce goods that go either to southeast Asia or to 
other parts of the globe that in turn are dependent on southeast Asia. 
So if you look at it that way, it's not too difficult to see that 
the Treasury's report is extremely accurate and unnerving. Economist 
Kellner says the reaction to the report on exports should not be panic 
but preventive measures that will minimize the effects of the global 
crisis on America's financial markets. While we should certainly not 
ignore the export side of the economy, I would point out that we are 
a long way from being drawn into the recessions that may be developing 
in other parts of the globe. The concern on my part is not just for 
trade but for the financial markets because an infection outside the 
U.S. could easily affect the U.S. in ways that we haven't seen since 
the 1930s. The economic report is providing the latest ammunition 
in the White House effort to persuade Congress to approve an $18 billion 
contribution to the International Monetary Fund.
