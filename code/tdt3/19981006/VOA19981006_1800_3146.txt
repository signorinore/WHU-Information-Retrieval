The Association of Southeast Asian Nations Osian says it will speed 
up a free trade plan to boost investor confidence in the region. Trade 
officials from Osian met in Manila Tuesday to discuss how to accelerate 
the tariff free plan. They decided to ask member countries to cut 
as many tariffs as possible to zero percent by the year 2003. This 
will be a change from their previous goal of bringing tariffs below 
five percent by that year. Under the new plan, average tariff rates 
are expected to fall from nearly five percent this year to less than 
three percent in 2003.
