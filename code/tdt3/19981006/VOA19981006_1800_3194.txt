Now, here's a chance to test your musical knowledge. First some clues. 
He is a singer/songwriter/guitarist and record producer. He's also 
done a little acting. Early in his career, he used various names and 
most people know him as one-half of a world famous duo. Here's VOA's 
Ray Freeman with details. The artist in question got his show business 
start when he was a youngster in primary school. Back then he sometimes 
used the name Jerry Landis and sometimes Paul Kane. He met his future 
musical partner while they both were cast members in a school play. 
They recorded a song together in 1955. Two years later they formed 
the duo known as Tom and Jerry and had a song on the American hit 
charts. That was A School Girl and the voices may sound familiar. 
Those two singing partners went on to become internationally famous. 
However, that record was the end of Tom and Jerry. They went onto 
college but kept in touch and in 1964, they reformed their partnership. 
A very successful career followed but by 1970 the team had broken 
up again. If you haven't guessed yet, that's Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel, 
known as Simon and Garfunkel. After that recording, they went their 
separate ways. It took two years for Paul Simon to release his first 
solo album. That was in 1972. It was one of the year's finest recordings 
and easily sold over a million copies. It also provided several hit 
singles, including Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard. His next album, 
just a year later in 1973, proved even better. There Goes 'Rhymin 
Simon had many outstanding songs including Koda Chrome and Loves Me 
Like A Rock. As a solo performer, Paul Simon pursued new directions 
in earnest. Throughout the 1970s and '80s, he explored numerous sounds 
like West African, Dixieland, Reggae, Brazilian and Zyiko music as 
well as gospel in the song, Loves Me Like A Rock. It represented a 
new side of Paul Simon. By 1989, Paul Simon started writing the music 
and lyrics for a production based on the life of a Puerto Rican immigrant 
accused of murder. Nearly ten years later, the show opened on Broadway, 
January 8th, 1998, to less than wonderful reviews. It closed after 
only a few performances. It was his only really big failure. But 'Rhymin 
Simon as he's come to be known keeps moving along. He celebrates his 
57th birthday on October 13th, and it's not likely to be long before 
we hear again from the 16 time Grammy award winner, Paul Simon. I'm 
Ray Freeman.
