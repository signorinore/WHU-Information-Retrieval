Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a short break. We'll be back with you in two minutes. This is VOA 
News Now. Tuesday is October 6th, 1998. On this date in 1890, the 
top leadership council of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day 
Saints, also known as Mormons, unanimously ended their religions official 
acceptance of polygamy. The Mormon's ban on polygamy brought them 
into compliance with laws passed by Congress that prohibited polygamy. 
Among the penalties for violating the anti-polygamy law was the confiscation 
of valuable church holdings, including real estate, buildings and 
other property. The Council's vote to ban polygamy confirmed a manifesto 
issued earlier by the president of the church, Wilfred Woodruff, declaring 
the intent of the church to submit to the new -- to the law of the 
land. The approval of the Woodruff manifesto ending multiple marriages 
and the church's decision to end certain cooperative ventures and 
involvement in politics cleared the way for Utah statehood in 1896. 
On October 6th, 1927, a theater in New York City presented The Jazz 
Singer, one of the first motion pictures with the synchronized sound 
of dialogue and music. The Warner Brothers Studio production with 
the Broadway star Al Jolsen thrilled audiences and included Jolsen's 
famous rendition of the song Mamie. Critics said the acting in The 
Jazz Singer was mechanical and that the sound was scratchy and tinny, 
about the same quality as a 1927 telephone. It was not in fact the 
first movie to experiment with sound but nevertheless, The Jazz Singer 
set off a revolution in the motion picture industry. And, the news 
is coming up next as VOA News Now continues.
