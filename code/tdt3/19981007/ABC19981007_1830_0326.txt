Let's go overseas. In the Serbian capital today, a defiant Serbian 
leader and one assumes, a frustrated American envoy. Mr. Holbrooke 
has been trying to convince Slobodan Milosevic to get his troops out 
of the province of Kosovo, where they have been murdering and terrorizing 
the ethnic Albanians population. 0% of the people in Kosovo is ethnic 
Albanians. They want their autonomy and at the very least they want 
the killing to stop. For everyone concerned, today is a little more 
dangerous than yesterday. Here's ABC's John McWethy. Intelligence 
sources say there are ominous signs that the Serbs may have no intention 
of backing down. But are preparing to be hit and to fight back. ABC 
News has learned that Serb anti-ship missiles have been taken out 
of storage and have been loaded onto naval vessels, that's significant 
because the U.S. has 17 ships operating nearby. In addition, the Serbs 
have moved part of their Navy to big tunnels that were dug along the 
coastline during world war II to hide ships. Anti-aircraft guns and 
missiles have been moved out of storage areas into the field and have 
been camouflaged. Some of the missiles have been upgraded with Russian 
technology, making them far more accurate. Intelligence sources say 
the Serbs were observed last week practicing shooting down low-flying 
drones similar to American cruise missiles. And finally, the small 
Serb air force has been dispersed throughout the country with its 
best planes, MiG-29s, put inside cement storage bunkers. As for the 
U.S., it will begin aircraft already in Europe. Half a dozen B-52s 
will leave from Louisiana carrying long-range cruise missiles. John 
McWethy, ABC News, Pentagon.
