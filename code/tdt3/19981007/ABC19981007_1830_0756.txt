12,000 people in my home town and I represent all of them. No time 
to get slowed down by irregularity. My doctor says, "exercise, eat 
more fiber." But sometimes a meal is whatever you get served. So my 
doctor suggested metamucil. It's not a chemically-altered fiber, not 
an artificial stimulant. The only leading brand with 100% natural 
fiber... is: keeps me regular, gently, changed my life. Now I can 
get out there and change the world. metamucil: At Uniroyal, in order 
to make a point about our new nailgard tires added a few to our test 
track. Nailgard tires-- designed to seal 90% of tread punctures instantly 
and permanently. Only from Uniroyal. Dog, thinking: T-bone! T-bone!

meaty T-bone steaks! Ya-hoo! I'm waking up! Mama brought you some
