Alan Greenspan has spoken again about the state of the economy, just 
the fact he's been speaking so much lately has made a lot of people 
nervous. He seemed to imply today that the irrational exub rans in 
the country has turned into irrational pessimism. Here's ABC's Betsy 
Stark. The millions of people who Hang on Alan Greenspan's every word 
got a mixed message from the fed chairman today. On the one hand, 
he declared the U.S. economy -- Really quite an impressive sight. 
But he also worried out loud about how problems in Asia and Russia 
have created a climate of fear that has led to -- A major shift toward 
risk aversion pretty much throughout the world. Risk aversion, people 
afraid to take chances. Out of stocks and into the safety of U.S. 
government bounds the same risk aversion is driving money out of the 
developing economies of Latin America. And now that American banks 
-- it's become increasingly difficult for U.S. businesses to borrow 
the money they need to grow. Three months ago, Internet entrepreneur, 
Doug Hanson had lined up $175 million in financing to expand his company. 
But after the Russian economy collapsed, he says it was impossible 
to get financing on any terms. The problem we have is that there are 
absolutely no funds available. So we are impacted by something we 
have no control over. Banks and brokerages are now afraid to lend 
to all but the biggest and safest of customers. What happens is no 
one wants to take the smaller credits so they can't raise it, and 
that's where you get your absolute credit crunch. Some say the credit 
was flowing too freely before and that risk was too easily overlooked. 
The fear now is that the pendulum has swung too far the other way 
and that deserving customers will be denied. Betsy Stark, ABC News, 
New York.
