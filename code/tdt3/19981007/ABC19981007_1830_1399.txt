With all that we've reported this week about the loss of privacy as 
most people know it, it isn't hard to believe that privacy ain't what 
it used to be. But there's always a contrarian on the subject. There's 
an interesting take on this in the current edition of "the New Yorker" 
magazine. The writer is Jonathan franzer, and we sought a moment's 
privacy up on the roof this afternoon to get his take on this. You 
think about what the country was like 100 years ago, we lived in a 
small town. On average, people didn't have their own bedrooms, they 
took public transportation or they walked. Shopkeepers knew what you 
were buying. You couldn't walk to the post office without people seeing 
what you were doing. Nowadays you live in large houses, everybody 
has their own bedroom, drive around in private vehicles. What's your 
definition of privacy? It's whether you feel private. Someone may 
have my phone tapped but if I don't know it, I feel private. But if 
I have your phone tapped, surely I'm invading your privacy. You're 
doing something. If I never find out about it, I'm not harmed. If 
I do find out about it, there are ways to address the problem. You 
have something like the easy pass which people use to get through 
toll bridges and tunnels. There may be security cameras. I don't think 
about them. Big brother could watch your every move. Seldom is it 
acknowledged that it means you don't have to wait in line at the toll 
booth. The idea that someone is going to bother tracking your movements 
seems just ridiculous. In fact, late at night on the subway platform 
or a desserted street, I don't mind the idea someone may be watching 
me. Maybe it's the concept that our privacy is being invaded that 
bothers us. When I walk down the sidewalk my own privacy feels invaded 
when someone is talking on a cell phone. I'd like there to be a place 
where I can be anonymous That's the place.
