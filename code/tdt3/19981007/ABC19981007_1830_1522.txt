When we come back, fresh from the farm. How do you know? The proof 
is right there, on the shell. With days I hotels in over 1,800 cities 
and towns you can go as far as you want. It'll always be right down 
the Lane. Max is a mighty dog. That's why he gets new mighty dog carved 
beef in gravy. Tender slices in savory gravy... to give Max all the 
energy he needs. New mighty dog carved beef and carved beef with pasta. 
Mighty dog... from friskies. Eating quaker oatmeal on a daily basis... 
can help lower cholesterol. Mine dropped 29 points. That's one under 
the speed limit here in Lafayette, Colorado. Just a reminder.
