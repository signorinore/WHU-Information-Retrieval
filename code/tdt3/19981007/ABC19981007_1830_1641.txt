Something new on the farm to report about. A huge farm collective 
in the midwest has a novel way to guarantee whether its eggs are fresh 
-- or at least when they've been laid. Basically, they run the eggs 
through their version of a laser printer, which stamps the date it's 
been laid -- the birth date right on the shell, in pink ink. You can't 
miss it. The idea here is to prevent unscrupulous producers and retailers 
from repackaging old eggs, which can make you sick. Good idea. Americans 
eat about 55 billion eggs a year. Is this a joke? It's no joke. But 
it may be a clever ploy -- truth in advertising, imagine that.
