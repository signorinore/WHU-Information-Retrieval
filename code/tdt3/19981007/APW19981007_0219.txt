In a last attempt to narrow the gaps on a West Bank troop withdrawal, 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright held three-way talks Wednesday 
with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Albright, Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said 
around a square table so small their knees and elbows were almost 
touching. Posing for photographers, Netanyahu and Arafat shook hands 
across the table and then Albright place her hand on top of theirs. 
Israeli and Palestinian officials said Albright has made little progress 
during her two-day visit. Albright, who is to leave the Mideast on 
Wednesday evening, had hoped to prepare the ground for a Mideast summit 
in Washington in mid-October. It was not clear whether U.S. President 
Bill Clinton would risk holding such a summit without any progress 
having been made in preparatory talks. Heading into the meeting at 
Erez, Arafat blamed Israel for the continued deadlock in the negotiations. 
Addressing a gathering of U.N. officials in Gaza City, Arafat said 
he has long accepted a U.S. proposal for an Israeli pullback from 
13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for Palestinian security 
gestures. ``Until now, the Israeli side did not give any sign of approval 
for the American initiative, but in spite of that we are continuing 
our negotiations today,'' Arafat said. Israel's main demand is that 
the Palestinians stop extremists from attacking Israel. A previous 
draft of a security agreement brokered by Israeli, Palestinian and 
U.S. security officials was vetoed by Netanyahu. Palestinian and Israeli 
officials said no progress has been made on revising the document. 
The director of the CIA, George Tenet, has arrived in the region and 
is participating in the negotiations, said a Palestinian security 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Earlier Wednesday, Albright 
briefed Israeli President Ezer Weizman over breakfast. Weizman said 
he was ``a bit more optimistic, but not entirely'' about the fate 
of Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking. Weizman said he heard nothing 
concrete in Albright's report, but expected the negotiations to continue 
this month. He said reaching an agreement depends on Arafat and Netanyahu. 
``I think this must be done,'' he said, ``but the prime minister must 
decide this, and Arafat has something to say about this, too.'' In 
Hebron, meanwhile, Arafat's Fatah movement called for clashes with 
Israeli troops on Friday to protest the prolonged closure of the city 
by the Israeli army. The city of 130,000 Palestinians has been sealed 
for the past week, barring residents from entering or leaving town. 
The closure was imposed after an assailant threw two hand grenades 
at Israeli troops, injuring 11 soldiers and 11 Palestinian civilians. 
A Fatah leaflet called for ``a day of clashes'' with Israeli troops 
along the lines dividing Hebron.
