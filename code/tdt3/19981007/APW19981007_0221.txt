An air force jet on routine patrol crashed in the mountains of India's 
Kashmir state Wednesday, police sources said. The sources, speaking 
on condition of anonymity, said it was not immediately clear whether 
the pilot survived the crash near Neel Babhri, a district in the Peer 
Punchal mountain range 90 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of Srinagar, 
the state's summer capital. The cause of the crash was under investigation. 
It did not appear linked to the separatist war in Kashmir.
