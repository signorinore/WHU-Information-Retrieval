Rescue workers in northern Nigeria were pulling bodies from the Kaduna 
River on Wednesday after a packed ferry capsized and 57 people drowned. 
It was unclear when exactly the accident occurred, although local 
authorities said it was earlier this week. Of the 57 confirmed victims, 
12 were from the same family, the local Punch newspaper reported. 
A number of the victims were children. The cause of the accident had 
not yet been determined, although investigators were on the scene, 
a local police spokesman said by telephone. Officials were still trying 
to determine the total number of people on board the boat, the police 
officer said without giving his name. River ferries, old and often 
in complete disrepair, ply the inland waters of Nigeria typically 
with passengers well beyond their capacities.
