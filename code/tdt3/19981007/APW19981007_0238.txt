An air force jet on routine patrol crashed in the mountains of India's 
Kashmir state Wednesday, killing the pilot, officials said. An aide 
to the chief of the Indian Air Force told The Associated Press that 
a single-seater MIG-21 BIS aircraft crashed near Neel Babhri, a district 
in the Peer Punchal mountain range 90 kilometers (50 miles) southwest 
of Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state. A high-level 
inquiry was ordered into the cause, the official said. Few other details 
were immediately available.
