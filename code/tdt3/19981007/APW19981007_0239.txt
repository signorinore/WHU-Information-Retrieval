Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Wednesday gave his Communist deputy 
broad powers over the new Cabinet's economic course, news reports 
said. However, Primakov also plans to personally oversee the Finance 
Ministry, which suggests he wants to reserve for himself the final 
say on major economic decisions. Primakov's First Deputy Prime Minister 
Yuri Maslyukov, who served as the last head of the Soviet central 
planning agency, has pushed for full control over the economic-related 
ministries. Maslyukov will be in charge of economics and trade ministries 
and various other bodies, including the committee for state property 
management that oversees privatization. Maslyukov will also step in 
as acting premier during Primakov's absence and oversee talks with 
the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other international 
lenders, the Russian media reported. Liberal economists have been 
critical of Maslyukov, saying he is likely to opt for at least some 
Soviet-style controls on the economy. But Primakov has decided to 
oversee the finance, foreign, defense and interior ministries, as 
well as tax service and customs committee and several other agencies, 
the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies reported Wednesday. The premier 
says he will continue with economic reforms, but opposes the ``wild 
capitalism'' that has characterized Russia's moves toward a market 
economy. Primakov spoke on national television Tuesday evening, the 
day before nationwide strikes, and assured Russians that the government 
would pay off all wage and pension arrears and make sure there would 
be no shortage of basic foods. In another development, Finance Minister 
Mikhail Zadornov criticized a recent statement by Maslyukov, who said 
Russia would be unable to pay off its debts this fall without help 
from the International Monetary Fund. Zadornov insisted that Russia 
could make it even without IMF aid, and added that Maslyukov's words 
didn't help advance Russia's interests, the business daily Kommersant 
said Wednesday. Zadornov, speaking to reporters in Washington, didn't 
explain how the government would finance its spending without Western 
aid. ``We must clearly understand, that any attempt to solve wage 
and pension debts by cranking up money-printing presses will lead 
to sharp rise in prices,'' Zadornov said on Russian television. Government 
officials on Tuesday forecast that inflation would reach about 200 
percent in 1998.
