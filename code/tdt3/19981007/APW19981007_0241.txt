Prime Minister Radu Vasile has said Romania cannot afford to go ahead 
with a dlrs1.45 billion helicopter deal with American company Bell 
Textron and will likely postpone the project, a newspaper reported 
Wednesday. Returning to Bucharest Tuesday after a six-day visit to 
Washington, Vasile said officials from the World Bank, International 
Monetary Fund and the U.S. administration had advised that the contract 
was not ``feasible'' in the near future. ``I agree with this,'' Vasile 
said, according to the daily Adevarul. Romania and Bell Textron signed 
a preliminary contract for a 70 percent stake in Romanian helicopter-manufacturer 
IAR Brasov in 1997. In July, the government agreed to guarantee a 
dollars 1.45 billion loan to the company. Under the agreement, Romania 
must purchase 96 AH1RO Dracula helicopters to be produced by Bell 
and IAR. But the deal was put on hold later amid wide criticism from 
media and some politicians, who argued it was too expensive for Romania's 
cash-strapped budget. The government has slashed expenditures to shrink 
the budget deficit. Finance Minister Daniel Daianu opposed the deal 
and said he would resign rather than sign it. He was later dismissed 
by President Emil Constantinescu, officially for other reasons. Constantinescu 
favors the project. A government commission is expected to decide 
on its fate by year's end.
