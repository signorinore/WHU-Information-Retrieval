Singapore has added six advanced U.S. fighter planes to its arsenal, 
and will take delivery of eight more soon, the Ministry of Defense 
said Wednesday. The McDonnell Douglas F-16 C/D Fighting Falcon planes 
arrived Saturday, bringing to 10 the number of these multi-role fighters 
stationed in Singapore, a ministry spokeswoman said. Eight additional 
F-16s are on order from a 1994 deal, the ministry said in a statement. 
The first four were delivered in August. The island republic maintains 
a strong air force relative to its other military branches, and has 
bought much of its military hardware from the United States, where 
it has to send its pilots for training because of space restraints. 
The U.S. Defense Department said in June that Singapore was considering 
buying eight Boeing-made Apache attack helicopters and other military 
hardware worth dlrs 620 million. Singapore is a vocal supporter of 
American military presence in the Asia-Pacific region, saying it is 
important for regional stability and security. The U.S. Navy maintains 
a logistics headquarters in Singapore.
