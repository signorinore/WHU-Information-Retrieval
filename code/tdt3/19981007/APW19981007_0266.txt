Outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl for European Commission president? 
Members of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union suggested in interviews 
released Wednesday that the European post would be ideally suited 
Kohl, whose push for closer European integration was one of the cornerstones 
of his 16 years as chancellor. ``Kohl's towering experience in foreign 
and European affairs is recognized on all sides,'' said Lower Saxony 
state party chairman Christian Wulff. ``There'd be certainly great 
support in Europe for such a suggestion.'' Ole von Beust, CDU leader 
in the Hamburg state government, called on Chancellor-elect Gerhard 
Schroeder to nominate Kohl to succeed current president Jacques Santer, 
whose 5-year term expires in 2000. The president of the European Commission 
is chosen by the leaders of the 15 European Union governments and 
must be confirmed by the European Parliament. The president heads 
a 20-member EU executive that runs the union's day-to-day affairs.
