Two mine workers were killed in separate accidents in eastern Ukraine, 
pushing this year's number of mine fatalities to more than 300, officials 
said Wednesday. One worker died from an electrical shock in the coal-producing 
Luhansk region on Tuesday and another, a train driver, died following 
an unspecified breach of safety rules at a separate mine in the area. 
Both mines where the accidents occurred belong to the the Donbasantratsyt 
state coal company, the Emergency Situations Ministry said. A total 
of 301 people have died in mine accidents in Ukraine so far in 1998, 
about 100 more than over the same period last year, according to government 
statistics. The number of miners killed on the job has been increasing 
steadily in recent years because mines lack the funds needed to modernize 
equipment and improve safety conditions. The worst single accident 
this year was in April, when a methane gas blast killed 63 workers 
at a mine in the eastern Donetsk region.
