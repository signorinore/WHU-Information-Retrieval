Ukraine's industrial production in the first nine months of 1998 fell 
0.3 percent compared to the same period last year, officials said 
Wednesday. The country's metallurgy and machine-building industries 
accounted for the fall, deputy presidential chief of staff Pavlo Haidutsky 
said. He said the two sectors, which account for about 40 percent 
of Ukraine's industrial production and export most of their products, 
were struck by the crisis in international markets, which forced them 
to significantly cut their exports. Ukraine has experienced steady 
economic decline since the Soviet collapse in 1991, but reported small 
economic growth in the first half of 1998. However, the former Soviet 
republic's economy is expected to shrink again this year due to a 
financial crisis that hit the country following the turmoil in neighboring 
Russia.
