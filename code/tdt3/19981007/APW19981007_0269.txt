Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa offered no new proposals Wednesday to 
rescue Hong Kong from recession, but promised in a policy address 
that the the government is committed to maintaining a free market 
economy. Tung painted a gloomy picture in his second such address, 
saying Hong Kong's ``difficult situation will continue well into 1999.'' 
He said the budget deficit may far exceed the June estimate of 20 
billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 2.56 billion) due to the economic 
downturn, and the deficit may retard growth in government expenditure 
in the next few years. Hong Kong's economic recovery hinges on ``an 
improvement in the external economic environment, a steadying of interest 
rates, stability in property market and the restoration of public 
confidence,'' he said. The government's priority now is to stabilize 
property prices, which have fallen 50 percent since last October, 
he added. He announced the suspension of a small subsidized middle-class 
housing program in an attempt to boost the private market, but stopped 
short of scrapping a housing construction target set last year, which 
has been widely blamed for the property slump. He also declined to 
disclose the government's plan when a nine-month freeze on land sales 
expires next March. Week's after Tung's inaugural policy address last 
year, Hong Kong was swept into Asia's financial turmoil. The once-booming 
economy is expected to shrink by 4 percent this year, and unemployment 
is at a 15-year high. In Wednesday's address, Tung urged Hong Kong 
to strengthen ties with the rest of China for faster recovery from 
recession, and urged international cooperation to monitor global fund 
movements and stop economic crises from spreading. ``In an integrated 
global market, no single economy can expect to be immune from the 
results of financial turmoil elsewhere in the world,'' he said. Tung 
also reiterated that ``the linked exchange rate is to stay,'' and 
``no foreign exchange control shall be applied.'' The Hong Kong currency's 
peg to the U.S. dollar has been under serious attack by speculators 
betting the Hong Kong dollar will sink. To defend the currency link, 
the government has to keep interest rates high. Tung also defended 
the much-criticized government market intervention in late August, 
when it spent an estimated 15 percent of its U.S. dlrs 96 billion 
in reserves to buy stocks and futures to keep share prices at levels 
that would punish speculators betting on a decline. The government 
later imposed more stringent trading regulations to make illegal trading 
and speculation more difficult. Tung said the intervention and new 
regulations were needed to counter harmful speculative activities 
and stabilize interest rates. He said it was ``not our intention to 
interfere with market forces,'' and that the aim was ``to consolidate 
Hong Kong's ability to manage its monetary affairs.'' Tung emphasized 
the need to diversify Hong Kong's economic base. Despite the projected 
deficit, he pledged 5 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 641 million) 
to promote the high-tech industry. To most people's disappointment, 
Tung largely failed to promise new measures to ease unemployment. 
Before his speech, a small group of protesters slipped a petition 
into his car, and waved a banner saying, ``Failure. Out of Control. 
Unemployment. Disappointment.''
