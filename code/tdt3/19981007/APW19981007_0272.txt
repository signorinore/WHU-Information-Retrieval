A Somali political faction Wednesday warned of a serious drought in 
southern Bay and Bakool regions. Dr. Ali Mohamed Ibrahim, health affairs 
secretary for the Somali Democratic Movement, said 3,000 people are 
facing starvation in 10 remote villages in the Bakool region. He said 
two small children and an elderly woman died from hunger in one of 
the villages. The drought comes after heavy flooding earlier in the 
year that washed away grain stored from the previous harvest and crops 
that had been planted. ``The land has almost become barren after the 
crops have been washed away last year,'' Ibrahim told reporters in 
the Somali capital. He said hundreds of people have fled their homes 
to seek sanctuary and pray for rain at the Sheikh Aweys shrine in 
Biyoley village, 75 kilometers (46 miles) northeast of Huddor, the 
regional capital. Huddor is 300 kilometers (185 miles) north of Mogadishu. 
People arriving from the affected region say the situation is aggravated 
by clashes between militiamen loyal to Mogadishu warlord Hussein Mohamed 
Aidid and those of the Rahawein Resistance Army. The fighting discourges 
subsistence farmers from returning to their plots. Ibrahim said diseases 
related to malnutrition like tuberculosis and diarrhea, as well as 
malaria, are gaining ground in the region where no humanaitarian organizations 
are operating because of the lack of security. Ibrahim said the World 
Food Program has only managed to deliver 400 tons of food to the region 
in the past two months, barely enough to feed one village.
