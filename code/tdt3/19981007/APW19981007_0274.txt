EREZ CHECKPOINT, Gaza Strip (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright convened three-way talks Wednesday with Palestinian and Israeli 
leaders in hopes of moving closer to a long-sought West Bank accord. 
Her spokesman, James P. Rubin, said Albright faced dozens of hurdles 
in her second day of Mideast peacemaking with Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The three 
had a three-way handshake as they posed for photographs at the start 
of the low-expectation meeting. Albright, Netanyahu and Arafat sat 
around a square table so small their knees and elbows were almost 
touching. Posing for photographers, Netanyahu and Arafat shook hands 
across the table and then Albright place her hand on top of theirs. 
Ruled out in advance was concluding an agreement while she is in the 
region. But Albright hoped to narrow unresolved issues, most particularly 
security measures to shield Israel from terrorism, in advance of a 
White House summit later in the month. At this border crossing between 
Israel and Palestinian-held Gaza, Albright intended to find out whether 
Arafat was ready to inch closer to Netanyahu's view, which the United 
States basically shares, that the Palestinian authority could do more 
to control terrorists on territory under its control. Albright said 
Tuesday there were ``tough choices that both sides have to make'' 
before U.S. President Bill Clinton hosts the summit with Netanyahu 
and Arafat. The summit date is not fixed yet, with Oct. 15 and Oct. 
20 possible starting dates. The location could be the Wye Plantation 
on Maryland's Eastern Shore, or somewhere else in the Washington area. 
Netanyahu has basically agreed to relinquish 13 percent of the West 
Bank, on top of the 27 percent promised to the Palestinians earlier, 
with 3 percent set aside for a nature preserve under joint Israeli-Palestinian 
security control. But with security and other issues still up in the 
air, Rubin said the peace process is ``not back on track'' yet. ``I 
think we envisage the summit as a multi-day exercise where some heavy 
lifting is going to be required,'' Rubin said Tuesday. ``We do not 
envisage it as a photo-op in which everything is pre-cooked.'' After 
Albright leaves the Mideast, probably later Wednesday, U.S. mediator 
Dennis Ross and Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk will remain 
for further talks with Israeli and Palestinian officials. Whatever 
the outcome, Albright said the United States intends to pursue a better 
relationship with the Palestinian Authority ``for its own sake.'' 
``We have thought for some time about increasing the level of discourse,'' 
she said. But she declined to say whether the administration was setting 
the stage for dealing ultimately with a Palestinian state. Heading 
into the meeting at Erez, Arafat blamed Israel for the continued deadlock 
in the negotiations. Addressing a gathering of U.N. officials in Gaza 
City, Arafat said he has long accepted a U.S. proposal for an Israeli 
pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for Palestinian 
security gestures. ``Until now, the Israeli side did not give any 
sign of approval for the American initiative, but in spite of that 
we are continuing our negotiations today,'' Arafat said. Israel's 
main demand is that the Palestinians stop extremists from attacking 
Israel. A previous draft of a security agreement brokered by Israeli, 
Palestinian and U.S. security officials was vetoed by Netanyahu. Palestinian 
and Israeli officials said no progress has been made on revising the 
document. CIA Director George Tenet has arrived in the region and 
is participating in the negotiations, said a Palestinian security 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
