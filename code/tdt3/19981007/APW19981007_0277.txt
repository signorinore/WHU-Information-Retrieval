In a last attempt to narrow the gaps on a West Bank troop withdrawal, 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright held three-way talks Wednesday 
with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Albright, Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said 
around a square table so small their knees and elbows were almost 
touching. Posing for photographers, Netanyahu and Arafat shook hands 
across the table and then Albright place her hand on top of theirs. 
At one point during the meeting, Albright got up and walked out of 
the room, leaving Netanyahu and Arafat to talk alone. It was the first 
time in a year the two leaders spoke without mediators. Israeli and,
