Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The three 
had a three-way handshake as they posed for photographs at the start 
of the low-expectation meeting. Albright, Netanyahu and Arafat sat 
around a square table so small their knees and elbows were almost

across the table and then Albright place her hand on top of theirs.

summit later in the month. At this border, 6th graf pvs.
