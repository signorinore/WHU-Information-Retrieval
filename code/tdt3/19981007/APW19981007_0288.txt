The central bank bought up to U.S. dlrs 500 million to slow the appreciation 
of the local currency as the Taiwan dollar rose against the U.S. dollar 
for the seventh straight trading day Wednesday, foreign exchange dealers 
said. Despite the central bank's intervention, the U.S. dollar still 
fell to an 18-week low of 33.346 Taiwan dollars as exporters, importers 
and holders of foreign currency deposits continued to dump the U.S. 
currency because of the surging Japanese yen, dealers said. The last 
time the dollar was that low was on June 1, when it bought 33.230 
Taiwan dollars. Trading volume hit U.S. dlrs 876.5 million, the highest 
level in a year. The central bank was buying the U.S. currency because 
exporters were complaining of the speed of Taiwan's recent currency 
appreciation, and to replenish foreign reserves spent defending the 
Taiwan dollar during its recent fall, said a dealer at a European 
bank. Central bank intervention is likely to continue Thursday, with 
the U.S. dollar expected to fall below 33 Taiwan dollars in coming 
sessions, said a dealer at a U.S. bank.
