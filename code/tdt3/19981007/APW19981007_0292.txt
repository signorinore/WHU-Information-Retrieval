France has detected traces of nerve gas on Iraqi warheads, The New 
York Times reported Wednesday, four months after the United States 
reached the same conclusion and accused Iraq of lying about its chemical 
weapons program. Testing on samples taken from the weapons reportedly 
show evidence of chemicals linked to VX, a drop of which on the skin, 
or inhaled, can kill an adult within minutes. Iraq, which has had 
to endure seven years of United Nations weapons inspections, has admitted 
it tried to make VX but has denied it was ever able to make enough 
of it or stabilize it sufficiently to load into weapons. U.N. arms 
experts must certify Iraq has destroyed its chemical, biological and 
nuclear weapons _ and the long-range missiles to deliver them _ before 
the Security Council will lift crippling sanctions imposed after Iraq 
invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf War. Swiss tests on warheads 
turned up negative. But a U.S. army laboratory, in tests whose results 
were disclosed in June, concluded that missile fragments contained 
traces of the gas. Weapons experts told the Times that the French 
findings would confirm the American tests. They showed the presence 
of components found in decomposed VX in missile warheads destroyed 
by Iraq and dug up by U.N. inspectors. Diplomats said the French were 
delaying the release of final tests because they didn't want to undermine 
Iraq's push at the United Nations this week to lift the sanctions, 
the Times said. France, which has major commercial interests in Iraq, 
has urged the United Nations to move faster to ease the sanctions 
imposed after the Gulf War. Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz 
said Tuesday that the Security Council has a ``legal'' and ``moral'' 
obligation to lift economic sanctions imposed against the nation after 
the Gulf War.
