Brazilian racing driver Pedro Diniz has been signed by Swiss-based 
Sauber Petronas for the 1999 season, the auto racing team said Wednesday. 
Diniz, 28, who currently drives for the Arrows-Yamaha team, will pair 
up with veteran French driver Jean Alesi, a press release from Sauber 
said. ``We are delighted that we could sign Pedro Diniz who has the 
necessary experience with four years in Formula One and 65 Grands 
Prix under his belt,'' the release quotes team principal Peter Sauber 
as saying. ``I am convinced that with Jean Alesi and Pedro Diniz, 
we will have the strong driver pairing in the coming season to reach 
our ambitious goals.'' Diniz said the team has the technical potential 
and the people to make an important step forward next season. He will 
take the place of British driver Johnny Herbert, who is moving from 
Sauber to Stewart-Ford.
