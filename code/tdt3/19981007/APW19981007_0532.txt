The Israeli and Palestinian leaders met for more than three hours 
Wednesday in their most extensive talks in a year, but a Palestinian 
negotiator said they made no progress toward agreement on a West Bank 
troop withdrawal. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to continue talks in Washington 
in mid-October, said the Palestinian negotiator, Nabil Shaath. ``The 
only thing that was agreed on is that we are going to Washington on 
the 14th,'' Shaath told reporters. The two leaders had been brought 
together by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright who tried to 
narrow the gaps during a two-day shuttle and prepare the ground for 
a Washington summit. The meeting at the Erez crossing between Israel 
and the Gaza Strip began with a three-way handshake, with Albright, 
Netanyahu and Arafat sitting at a square table so small their elbows 
and knees were almost touching. The three smiled for photographers. 
Albright twice left the room to let Arafat and Netanyahu talk alone. 
The two had not spoken without a mediator for over a year. The talks 
then moved to a nearby Palestinian guesthouse where the three had 
lunch. It marked the first time Netanyahu ventured into Palestinian-controlled 
territory. Asked about the talks, Albright said ``they are moving 
on'' and Netanyahu said they were ``good.'' Heading into the meeting 
at Erez, Arafat had blamed Israel for the continued deadlock in the 
negotiations. Addressing a gathering of U.N. officials in Gaza City, 
Arafat said he has long accepted a U.S. proposal for an Israeli pullback 
from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for Palestinian security 
gestures. ``Until now, the Israeli side did not give any sign of approval 
for the American initiative, but in spite of that we are continuing 
our negotiations today,'' Arafat said. Israel's main demand is that 
the Palestinians stop extremists from attacking Israel. A previous 
draft of a security agreement brokered by Israeli, Palestinian and 
U.S. security officials was vetoed by Netanyahu. Palestinian and Israeli 
officials said no progress has been made on revising the document. 
The director of the CIA, George Tenet, has arrived in the region and 
is participating in the negotiations, said a Palestinian security 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Earlier Wednesday, Albright 
briefed Israeli President Ezer Weizman over breakfast. Weizman said 
he was ``a bit more optimistic, but not entirely'' about the fate 
of Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking. Weizman said he heard nothing 
concrete in Albright's report, but expected the negotiations to continue 
this month. He said reaching an agreement depends on Arafat and Netanyahu. 
``I think this must be done,'' he said, ``but the prime minister must 
decide this, and Arafat has something to say about this, too.''
