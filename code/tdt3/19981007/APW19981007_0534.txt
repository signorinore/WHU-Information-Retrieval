Russia has supplied the Serbs with advanced surface-to-air missile 
equipment that will threaten NATO aircraft if the go-ahead is given 
for airstrikes in the province of Kosovo, The Times of London reported 
Wednesday. Quoting unnamed senior defense officials in London, The 
Times said the Serbs had acquired new air defense systems that ``had 
to be taken very seriously.'' The threat was discussed Tuesday at 
a meeting of the chiefs of staff of Britain's Ministry of Defense, 
the newspaper said. The Serbs have been supplied with new warheads, 
fuses and sensors for their mobile Sam 6 missiles, and the upgrade 
of the old Russian surface-to-air missile has made it faster and given 
it an extended range, the report said. It was not clear whether the 
arms had been acquired through official Russian channels or via unofficial 
Russian suppliers, The Times said. On Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council 
called for ``full and sustained compliance'' with a two-week-old resolution 
demanding that Yugoslavia withdraw its forces from Kosovo and end 
its attacks on civilians in the separatist province.
