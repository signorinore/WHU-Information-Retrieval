Trade ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations signed 
an agreement Wednesday to remove restrictions on investment in the 
region in an effort to make it more attractive to investors and overcome 
its financial crisis. ASEAN Secretary-General Rodolfo Severino said 
the agreement to establish an ``ASEAN Investment Area'' will make 
it easier for investors in one country to invest in other countries 
in the region. The agreement, which officials hope will boost trade 
and investment in the once economically vibrant region, capped the 
first day of the annual ASEAN economic ministers' meeting. Investment 
in Southeast Asia has dropped sharply since the region's currency 
crisis hit 15 months ago. The AIA is a bid to make the region again 
``very competitive, with a very transparent and attractive investment 
climate,'' says Melito Salazar Jr., Philippine undersecretary of trade 
and industry. Most ASEAN members are either mired in recession or 
grappling with sharply lower growth as a result of the crisis. ASEAN 
groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, 
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Under the agreement, national treatment 
_ applying the same investment rules to both local and foreign businessmen 
_ will be extended to ASEAN investors by 2010 and to all other investors 
10 years later. All industries will be opened to outside investors, 
except those that affect national security and public morals, those 
relating to the protection of human, animal or plant life and those 
necessary to comply with laws to protect the public. In case of ``serious'' 
balance of payments and financial difficulties, an ASEAN country may 
adopt investment restrictions, but such measures should be temporary 
and should not harm other members of ASEAN, according to the agreement. 
Each country can also draw up a list of investment areas or industries 
that it cannot immediately open up to others in ASEAN. This ``exclusion 
list,'' however, will be phased out by 2010, except for Laos, Myanmar 
and Vietnam, ASEAN's most recent members. Vietnam will be allowed 
to phase out its exclusion list by 2013 and Laos and Myanmar by 2015. 
The trade ministers also signed an agreement under which they will 
notify each other of any changes in trade policies, including tariffs, 
quotas, surcharges, customs valuation, export taxes, licensing, and 
foreign exchange controls related to trade.
