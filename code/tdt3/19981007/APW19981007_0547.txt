A planeload of mushrooms found to contain a radioactive substance 
was scrapped by Bulgarian authorities. The mushrooms, picked in southern 
Bulgaria and destined for export, contained radioactive cesium-137, 
Peter Konstantinov of the National Institute Hydrology and meteorology 
told the daily 24 Chassa for a story Wednesday. Konstantinov was quoted 
as saying the radiation probably came from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear 
reactor disaster in Ukraine. The report didn't give the amount of 
mushrooms destroyed or specify the degree of radioactivity. It also 
did not say their destination.
