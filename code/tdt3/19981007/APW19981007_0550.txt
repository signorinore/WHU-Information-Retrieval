Thailand will seek to tap part of a dlrs 30 billion financing package 
being offered by Japan to help Southeast Asian countries overcome 
their currency crisis, a Thai official said Wednesday. Deputy Prime 
Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said Thailand needs supplementary financing 
to help alleviate its present financial squeeze. Tapping the Japanese 
financing would help support the issuing of government bonds in international 
markets, he said. Japan is putting together the dlrs 30 billion aid 
package in response to international demands that it do more to ease 
the region's financial crisis. Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa 
said the plan envisages the Export-Import Bank of Japan guaranteeing 
debts and buying government bonds of the Asian countries. Supachai 
said that following Thailand's agreement last year with the International 
Monetary Fund for financial support, it became clear that further 
financing was needed, particularly to boost the capital of financial 
institutions such as the Bank for Agriculture and the Housing Bank. 
Thailand is the beneficiary of a dlrs 17.2 billion IMF-arranged credit 
line. He made clear, however, that any funds tapped from the Japanese 
financing package would not be plowed into the country's commercial 
banks. Supachai, speaking outside a meeting of trade ministers from 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, said the funds could play 
a significant part in successfully launching government bonds. He 
noted that external factors have already driven up the margins on 
existing Thai bonds to ``prohibitive heights.'' Thailand had planned 
to issue an initial tranche of dlrs 1 billion or dlrs 2 billion in 
global bonds this year, but indefinitely postponed its plans after 
premiums on similar U.S. Treasury bonds rose as high as 700 basis 
points, from around 300-400 basis points in the second quarter. Supachai 
noted that a recent Thai bond guaranteed by the World Bank for the 
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand achieved a far better 
risk rating than some other domestic bonds. He said that if the Japanese 
financing package could be used to address this kind of issue, it 
would help to mobilize additional funds for Thailand. ``We can cope 
with the situation at the moment, but it would certainly help alleviate 
the credit squeeze,'' he said. Supachai made clear that any funds 
tapped from the package would not be used to repay Thailand's loans 
to Japanese banks.
