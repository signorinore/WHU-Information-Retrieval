A week after a car bomb injured 13 people in Naples, police Wednesday 
found explosives planted in a moped outside the city's courthouse. 
Bomb experts went to the site after police received an anonymous tip. 
The bomb was composed of 400 grams (14 ounces) of plastic explosives 
and could have caused widespread damage had it been connected to a 
detonator and went off, police said. There was no claim of responsibility. 
Last week's attack in a crowded neighborhood was blamed on the Camorra 
crime syndicate. There was also a bazooka attack on the villa of suspected 
boss which damaged a gate but caused no injuries.
