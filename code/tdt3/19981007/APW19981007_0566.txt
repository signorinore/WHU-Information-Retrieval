After lengthy talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, U.S. Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright announced on Wednesday an Oct. 15 summit 
would be held in Washington to try to work out agreement on a West 
Bank accord. ``We made significant progress,'' she said after meeting 
with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat. In fact, Albright told reporters, ``We are in a far better 
position to finalize all the issues.'' Albright's meetings with Arafat 
and Netanyahu followed up on discussion the two leaders had with President 
Clinton last month. At the time, President Bill Clinton invited them 
back to Washington to try to finalize a West Bank accord.
