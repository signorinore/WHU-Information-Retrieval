Police on Wednesday evacuated the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and searched 
the building after an anonymous caller claimed a bomb was planted 
in the premises, officials said. Police searched inside and outside 
the building but found nothing, said police officials, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. The U.S. mission did not comment on the report, 
but an official told The Associated Press that the embassy was operating 
normally. Police officials said an embassy official received a call 
at 5:30 a.m. (0330 GMT) informing about a bomb. The officials did 
not say how many staffers were evacuated but at that hour the embassy 
would have been manned only by a skeletal overnight staff. The embassy 
received another call at 7:30 a.m. (5:30 GMT), the officials said. 
The caller, a man speaking with a southern Egyptian accent, demanded 
the release by Oct. 12 of two Egyptian clerics from American and Israeli 
prisons, said the officials. Failure to release them will result in 
American embassies being targeted, said the caller who identified 
himself as Abu el-Yamin. He claimed to be a member of the ``Holy Struggle 
in the Path of Allah,'' a previously unknown group, the officials 
said. Islamic militants who have been fighting since 1992 to oust 
Egypt's secular government of President Hosni Mubarak are based mostly 
in the south. The caller did not specify which embassies would be 
targeted or mention any bomb at the embassy in Cairo, said the officials. 
The clerics that the caller wanted released are Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, 
the blind Egyptian cleric serving life sentence in the United States 
for a plot to bomb U.S. landmarks; and Sheik Mohammed Abdel-Rahman 
from an Israeli prison. Security for the U.S. Embassy and other American 
institutions has been stepped up since the twin bombings on Aug. 7 
of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The blasts killed 259 people 
and wounded thousands.
