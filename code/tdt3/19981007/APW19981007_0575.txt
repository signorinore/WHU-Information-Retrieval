She noted that the two leaders spontaneously decided to extend their 
talks over lunch at a nearby Palestinian guesthouse, and that Netanyahu 
crossed into Palestinian-controlled territory for the first time in 
order to join Arafat in the meal. Albright cautioned, however, that 
``an awful lot of problems still have to be resolved and those are 
the kind the leaders have to resolve while we are in Washington.'' 
Albright said the meetings in Washington would begin Oct. 15 and would 
be open-ended. She said both Netanyahu and Arafat had agreed to commit 
``substantial and intensive'' time to the effort in Washington to 
reach an agreement. She said U.S. President Bill Clinton would be 
``very much involved'' in the negotiations. She said ``substantial 
progress'' had been made on five issues, including the operation of 
a Palestinian airport and an industrial park, during Wednesday's talks. 
In the meantime, she urged both sides to ``keep their eye on the ball'' 
and not to take unilateral actions before the summit. Palestinian 
negotiator Nabil Shaath was less optimistic, saying no agreements 
were reached Wednesday except to continue talks in Washington. The 
meeting at the Erez crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip began 
with a three-way handshake, with Albright, Netanyahu and Arafat sitting 
at a square table so small their elbows and knees were almost touching. 
The three smiled for photographers. Albright twice left the room to 
let Arafat and Netanyahu talk alone. The two had not spoken without 
a mediator for over a year. Heading into the meeting at Erez, Arafat 
had blamed Israel for the continued deadlock in the negotiations. 
Addressing a gathering of U.N. officials in Gaza City, Arafat said 
he has long accepted a U.S. proposal for an Israeli pullback from 
13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for Palestinian security 
gestures. ``Until now, the Israeli side did not give any sign of approval 
for the American initiative, but in spite of that we are continuing 
our negotiations today,'' Arafat said. Israel's main demand is that 
the Palestinians stop extremists from attacking Israel. A previous 
draft of a security agreement brokered by Israeli, Palestinian and 
U.S. security officials was vetoed by Netanyahu. Palestinian and Israeli 
officials said no progress has been made on revising the document. 
The director of the CIA, George Tenet, has arrived in the region and 
is participating in the negotiations, said a Palestinian security 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
