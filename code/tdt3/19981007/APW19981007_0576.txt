Warning that the ``decisive moment'' is approaching, a senior U.S. 
envoy held more talks Wednesday with Slobodan Milosevic after failing 
to persuade the Yugoslav president to pull out more forces from Kosovo 
to avoid NATO airstrikes. Milosevic has remained defiant through two 
meetings, during which Richard Holbrooke sought to convince him that 
Washington is equally firm in demanding that he comply with U.N. resolutions 
or face military action. Reflecting a grim mood in the U.S. delegation, 
Holbrooke had only terse public comments ahead of the latest talks 
that started at mid-afternoon Wednesday. ``The situation's extremely 
serious,'' he said.
