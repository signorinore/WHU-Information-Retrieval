The Angolan government cut the United Nations' broadcasting space 
on national radio Wednesday from three hours to two, increasing tension 
between the peace monitors and the ruling MPLA party. Citing ``the 
country's highest interests'', RNA state radio authorities axed the 
U.N.'s one-hour morning program ``The Paths of Peace'' but allowed 
it to keep the afternoon and nighttime editions. The government was 
reportedly annoyed when the show recently aired an interview with 
U.N. regional commander Bernard Gendre, who criticized the conduct 
of the Angolan Armed Forces. The U.N.'s special envoy to Angola Issa 
Diallo was reported to be seeking to clarify the government's decision. 
Diallo, who arrived in Angola late August, has been trying to meet 
with Jonas Savimbi, leader of former rebel group UNITA, in one of 
his highland strongholds where he retreated after 1992 elections. 
The government has prevented the U.N. diplomat from traveling to Andulo 
or Bailundo, some 480 kilometers (300 miles) east of the capital, 
allegedly for security reasons. The government halted contact with 
Savimbi a month ago and asked the U.N. to follow suit. But the U.N. 
Security Council called on the ruling MPLA party to reverse its decision, 
reportedly angering President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. The U.N. has 
a peacekeeping force in Angola and a mediating group which oversees 
implementation of the 1994 Lusaka protocol that ended a two-decade 
civil war between UNITA and the government. Four years on, the deal 
remains to be fully implemented and hostility between the former foes 
is rising, edging the peace process towards collapse. The government 
estimates the number of people displaced because of recent developments 
at nearly 800,000.
