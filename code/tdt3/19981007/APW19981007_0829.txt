World No. 2 Patrick Rafter crashed out in the first round of the dlrs 
1 million Swiss Indoors on Wednesday, toppled in straight sets by 
Czech Daniel Vacek. The two-time U.S. Open champion surrendered 7-6 
(9-7), 7-5 to Vacek, ranked 44, after an hour and a half of play. 
``There were only one or two key points in the match and they didn't 
go my way,'' said Rafter, currently leading the race for berths at 
the ATP Tour World Championship in Hannover next month. ``But that's 
often the case in indoors. ``My game is more suited to hard court, 
and if I want to become world No.1 I'll have to learn how to play 
on all surfaces ... quickly.'' Rafter, the winner of six titles this 
season, narrowly lost the first set to Vacek, before taking a medical 
time-out so his therapist could massage his left hip. Serving well 
but laboring in his return game, Rafter seemed to struggle on the 
indoor carpet. Playing in only his first tournament since successfully 
defending his title at Flushing Meadows a month ago, the 25-year-old 
Australian showed only brief glimpses of the talent which led him 
to six titles this season. Trailing 15-40 at 4-5 on his own serve, 
Rafter suddenly lit up, rallying to score four consecutive points 
to save two match points. Though Vacek failed to convert those first 
break points of the match, he didn't waste a second opportunity. The 
Czech held his own serve to go up 6-5, then blasted four return winners 
to clinch the match on a love game. ``Daniel kept serving as hard 
as possible,'' said Rafter, who will next play in Vienna, Lyon, Stuttgart 
and Paris. ``I served pretty well but I need to put more pressure 
on my opponents and construct points better indoors.'' The 28-year-old 
Vacek, a doubles specialist still looking for his first singles title, 
will face France's Fabrice Santoro in the second round. In other first 
round play, seventh-seed Greg Rusedski began the defence of his crown 
with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over German qualifier Axel Pretzsch. ``Hopefully 
I'll be successful here,'' said Rusedski, the losing finalist in Toulouse 
last weekend. ``I like it here and I have a record of nine wins and 
only one loss here.'' Ranked 14 in the world, Rusedski needed just 
52 minutes to steamroll past Pretzsch, who defeated veterans Niklas 
Kulti of Sweden and Czech Martin Damm to qualify. Holder of the fastest 
serve on the Tour, Rusedski used that strength to stun the world number 
311, blasting three consecutive aces past Pretzsch in his opening 
serve. Rusedski's return proved just as effective against the young, 
shellshocked German, playing in his first career ATP Tour event. While 
Pretzsch managed to hold his opening serve of the match, the Briton 
easily broke him twice in each set on way to the second round. ``I 
was really pleased with the way I played,'' said Rusedski, returning 
to form after spending two months nursing his left ankle after tearing 
ligaments at Queens in June. ``Everything is coming together nicely.'' 
Rusedski will take on another German qualifier, David Prinosil, in 
the second round. Later, world No. 1 Pete Sampras will play 1994 champion 
Wayne Ferreira, and wildcard Boris Becker takes on Sweden's Thomas 
Johansson.
