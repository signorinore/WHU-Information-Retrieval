President Roman Herzog has reportedly given up seeking a second term 
next year after Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who nominated him for the 
job, lost the German election. Herzog's retirement would clear the 
way for parliament to elect a Social Democrat, Johannes Rau, to the 
mainly ceremonial post in May, the Bonner Rundschau newspaper said 
Wednesday, citing ``reliable sources.'' The president's office refused 
comment on the report. With the Social Democrats' victory in Sept. 
27 elections, the presidency is among the posts now within their power 
to decide. Some Social Democrats say it's time for Germany's first 
female president. They have suggested Jutta Limbach, chief justice 
of Germany's supreme court. Others are proposing a candidate from 
former communist East Germany, religion professor and former Social 
Democrat lawmaker Richard Schroeder. But Rau, 67, is considered the 
top contender. He governed North-Rhine Westphalia, the nation's most 
populous state, for two decades until making way for a younger successor 
last spring. The way the Social Democrats eased him out fed speculation 
of a party deal to put him in line for the presidency. Herzog, a moderate 
conservative, was elected to a five-year term in 1994 when Rau was 
also a contender. He had indicated he would not seek re-election, 
but appeared to back off when Kohl's Christian Democrats sought to 
benefit from his popularity during this year's election campaign. 
Nominally above politics, the German president is considered the nation's 
conscience. He is elected by a session of both houses of parliament.
