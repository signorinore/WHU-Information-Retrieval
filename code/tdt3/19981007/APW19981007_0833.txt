Armed assailants killed seven people and wounded five others Wednesday 
in southwest Algeria in an attack that radio reports described as 
a roadside ambush. The killings, near Chlef, 220 kilometers (135 miles) 
southwest of Algiers, were announced in a statement by the security 
forces. But no details were given. The radio reports cited locals 
as saying it was an ambush by Islamic militants disguised as police 
officers. The reports said the army had launched a hunt in the area 
for the killers. The massacre came a day after army troops killed 
seven suspected Islamic militants in the capital and western Algeria. 
Also Tuesday, seven civilians were slain in the western town of Mascara. 
More than 75,000 people have died in the six-year insurgency that 
flared after Algeria's military-backed government canceled 1992 parliamentary 
elections the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was on the verge 
of winning.
