Being the Masters and British Open champion, Mark O'Meara appeared 
the ideal player to partner golf-loving Prince Andrew in the pro-am 
before the Dunhill Cup. He had one problem. What to call his highness. 
``When I first met him I said: ``Hello, Prince Andrew, I'm Mark O'Meara. 
I called him Andrew the rest of the day. I don't know if that's right 
or wrong,'' O'Meara said after their round at the Old Course, St. 
Andrews. ``No? It was wrong? I'm sorry,'' the slightly embarrassed 
golf star said. ``No disrespect intended. He didn't have a problem 
with it. I call him Prince a few times so that makes up for it.'' 
John Daly, who teams up with O'Meara and Tiger Woods on a United States 
team in the 16-nation championship at the home of golf, said he wasn't 
flustered when he played golf with President Bush. ``When I met George 
Bush or the first time, I said `Hi, George, how ya doin?''' Daly said. 
According to O'Meara, Prince Andrew, who bears a remarkable likeness 
to former British Open champion Justin Leonard, occasionally played 
like him too. ``He played extremely well. I think he shot four over 
par, playing off seven. That's what he told me. He was fun to play 
with. It was quite an honor,'' O'Meara said. ``I gave him my phone 
number in Orlando and said that if he wanted to come and play at our 
development with Tiger and Payne Stewart he can. If he comes to Florida 
we'd love to have a game with him. ``He said he's only played for 
six or seven years and he just needs to work on his short game,'' 
O'Meara said. ``He has a good back swing and down swing. He hits it 
long enough and he hit some nice putts today. The short game is the 
thing. ``One of our other other partners made 10 pars and two birdies. 
I asked him what he was doing this week. He could take my spot on 
the team.''
