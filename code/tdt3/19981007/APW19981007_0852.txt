Switzerland has made a protest to the Guatemalan foreign minister 
over the conviction last month of three Swiss men for drug trafficking, 
an official said Wednesday. At a court in Puerto Barrios, Guatemala, 
the three, along with a German and a Guatemalan, were sentenced to 
10 to 20 years in prison in the so-called ``German connection'' case. 
The case involved dlrs 100 million in shipments of cocaine sent from 
Guatemala to Europe hidden in containers and ornamental plants. Swiss 
authorities have concluded that parts of the proceedings ``didn't 
meet legal requirements'' and are calling for information on them, 
Armin Ritz of the Swiss foreign ministry said. ``That means, in other 
words, that we don't agree with the verdict,'' Ritz told a news conference. 
A visit to Guatemala this month by a Swiss trade representative has 
also been put on hold, he said. Ritz said Guatemala's foreign minister, 
Eduardo Stein Barrillas, received the Swiss representation on Tuesday 
and promised to answer it as soon as possible. Switzerland stressed 
that it fully supports Guatemala in fighting drug trafficking, he 
added. The Puerto Barrios court sentenced Swiss citizen and former 
Nestle executive Andreas Haenggi Wyndler, 60, to 12 years in prison 
and a fine of dlrs 77,000. Nicholas Haenggi Chalandrian, 22, Andreas 
Haenggi's son, was sentenced to 20 years and a dlrs 155,000 fine, 
as was Swiss citizen Silvio Giovanoli, 30. The following day, the 
Swiss foreign ministry called the sentences ``extremely hard and disproportionate.'' 
The ``German connection'' scheme was uncovered in November 1996 when 
police in Duesseldorf, Germany, found 170 kilograms (375 pounds) of 
cocaine hidden in plastic bags in a shipment of Guatemalan hammocks. 
The defendants said they had been unwitting accomplices to the scheme. 
Defense lawyers said they would appeal the verdict. Nestle, which 
has always supported Haenggi since his arrest, has said it will continue 
to provide support to Haenggi and his family during the appeal process. 
Last week, a defense lawyer in Guatemala for the three Swiss men accused 
the judge handling the case of sexually harassing her and threatening 
her with death.
