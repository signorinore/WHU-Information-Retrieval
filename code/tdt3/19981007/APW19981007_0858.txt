The Czech government allowed Radio Free Europe broadcasts into Iraq 
on Wednesday, but insisted the station's location should change to 
avoid security risks. Earlier this year, the U.S. government-funded 
radio station, which operates out of Prague, announced plans to expand 
its broadcasts into Iran and Iraq. The move met with concerns by the 
Czech Cabinet, which protested the station's location in a densely 
populated residential area in northern Prague. ``The government agrees 
with the RFE broadcasts (into Iraq) on condition that due to security 
risks involved the station's location be reviewed with the respective 
Czech authorities,'' vice premier Vladimir Spidla said Wednesday. 
He said consultations about a new location were already underway but 
offered no details. ``We think the present location is not a suitable 
one,'' Spidla said. The Farsi-language service into Iran was already 
approved by the Czech government, but it wasn't clear wheter the two 
stations would move together or separately. ``Broadcasting into Iran 
was not on the agenda today,'' said Spidla. During the Cold War, RFE 
was popular among Czechs and others in the Soviet bloc as an alternative 
to the Communist propaganda of their own media. Now, however, many 
ordinary Czechs are nervous that their country may end up being drawn 
into the conflict if the Iranian and Iraqi programs go on the air. 
RFE began transmitting from Munich, Germany, in 1951, spreading uncensored 
news to Soviet-controlled countries behind the Iron Curtain during 
the Cold War between the Americans and the Soviets. It moved its headquarters 
to Prague in 1995, following the collapse of communism six years earlier 
and began broadcasting out of a prominent downtown building that once 
served as Parliament of federal Czechoslovakia. The Iraq and Iran 
broadcasts were planned out of a residential area in northern Prague 
in close proximity to a nursery school and several embassies.
