Martina Hingis survived a scare against Anna Kournikova at the Porsche 
Grand Prix on Wednesday and held on to her No. 1 ranking _ at least 
temporarily. But Lindsay Davenport, who trails Hingis by 26 points, 
stayed in hot pursuit by dismissing Mary Pierce 6-1, 6-3 in another 
second-round match. Hingis, who has held the top ranking for 80 weeks, 
rallied to win 1-6, 6-2, 6-2, benefiting from Kournikova's 13 double-faults. 
``I jammed my ankle in jogging this morning and for the first three 
games I couldn't see anything because I forgot to put in my contact 
lenses,'' Hingis said. ``But after I warmed up the ankle got better, 
I got the lenses and I got into the match,'' the 18-year-old Swiss 
said. Hingis, winner of the dlrs 450,000 indoor tournament the last 
two years, could clinch her third title in a row and still lose the 
top ranking to Davenport, the U.S. Open champion. Whether Davenport 
can claim the No. 1 spot will depend on how many bonus points she 
can earn by beating high-ranked players. Had she lost to Kournikova, 
Hingis would have lost the No. 1 ranking. Kournikova, the 13-ranked, 
17-year-old Russian who had beaten Hingis in the fin set, she could 
not hold her own and folded in 78 minutes. ``You can say she gave 
me a belated birthday present,'' said Hingis, who turned 18 last week. 
``I don't know what happened, normally she has a very solid serve.'' 
If she loses the No. 1 ranking this week, Hingis could regain it next 
week in Zurich. Davenport cruised against Pierce, who was treated 
for blisters on her left foot after the third game. The American needed 
only 61 minutes for her victory.
