Russia pushed Wednesday for a meeting of the six-country Contact Group 
on Yugoslavia, and warned that NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia 
would only lead to more bloodshed in Kosovo province. The Interfax 
news agency said Foreign Minister Ivan Ivanov made an ``emergency 
departure'' to London for a meeting of the Contact Group of Russia, 
the United States, Britain, Germany, France and Italy. But the British 
Foreign Office said no meeting had been scheduled for this week, and 
the Russian Foreign Ministry said no decision had been made on Ivanov's 
plans. Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said NATO airstrikes 
against Serbia, the main component of Yugoslavia, would be like a 
declaration of war. ``We evaluate that this is not a penalty or punishment 
of an isolated country but almost a real war,'' Sergeyev said in Athens 
after meeting with his Greek counterpart. ``We believe diplomatic 
efforts must continue, and in these efforts the whole of the European 
community must be involved,'' he said. Russia objects to the violent 
methods Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has used to crack down 
on separatist Kosovo, but it opposes NATO airstrikes. Russia and Serbia 
are long-time allies, sharing a Slavic heritage and Orthodox religion. 
President Boris Yeltsin has been trying to drum up support in phone 
calls this week to other world leaders. On Wednesday he spoke to British 
Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is visiting China. Yeltsin told Blair 
that airstrikes ``would be disastrous for global peace and drastically 
change the situation'' in the region, a Kremlin statement said. Also 
Wednesday, leaders of the State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, 
said they wanted to meet with Moscow-based ambassadors of NATO countries 
to discuss Kosovo.
