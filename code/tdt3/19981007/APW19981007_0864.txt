Alistair Cooke, whose ``Letter from America'' began airing on British 
radio more than a half-century ago, has been honored for his perfect 
use of language. Cooke was overwhelmingly voted Best Living Speaker 
of the English Language by listeners of BBC Radio 4's ``Word of Mouth'' 
program. ``I love broadcasting and try to write a form of English 
which can be, as the Bible says, `understanded of the people,' meaning 
truckdrivers, professors, bishops, nurses, people everywhere,'' Cooke 
said. ``The greatest compliment I can be paid is when people say `You 
sound exactly the way you sound over the radio,' '' he said. Cooke, 
89, has presented his weekly window on life in the United States since 
1947. Asked how his years living in the United States have affected 
his speech, he said: ``My wife always says that I don't speak British 
English. I don't speak American English _ I speak like a child sent 
at an early age to school in Switzerland.'' Cooke's linguistic pet 
peeve _ people's ``refusal to speak the most frequently spoken vowel 
in the English language, `uh' '' _ as in the ``a'' in ``ago.'' ``Americans 
have got into the habit of saying `ay,' '' he said. ``That drives 
me nuts, and I write to them when I hear it.''
