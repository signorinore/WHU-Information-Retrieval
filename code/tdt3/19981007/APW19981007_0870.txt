Arsenal's Patrick Vieira was charged with misconduct Wednesday after 
the Football Association reviewed a clash between Arsenal and Sheffield 
Wednesday at Hillsborough on Sept. 26. The match was marred by a brawl 
between players which led to Wednesday's Italian striker Paolo Di 
Canio pushing referee Paul Alcock to the ground. Di Canio pushed Alcock 
after he was given a red card for his part in the brawl but later 
accused the referee of taking a dive. The Italian striker was immediately 
suspended by Sheffield Wednesday and returned to Italy pending the 
Football Association investigation. Arsenal's Martin Keown was also 
red-carded by Alcock after the incident but won an appeal Wednesday 
and had a three match ban lifted. The Football Association accepted 
Keown's claim that his intention was to act as a peacemaker in the 
incident when Di Canio confronted Vieira. An F.A. statement released 
Wednesday said the sending off would stand but Keown would not be 
punished further. Vieira, however, was charged with inciting Sheffield 
Wednesday supporters by making gestures as he left the field after 
the match and of pushing a police officer at the entrance of the players' 
tunnel. Vieira, who has the full backing of Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, 
has 14 days to request a hearing. ``I was right behind Patrick in 
the tunnel and I saw what happened _ nothing at all,'' Wenger was 
quoted saying last week.
