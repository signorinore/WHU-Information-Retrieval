A French court on Wednesday slapped the country's latest book ban 
on an art publication with the picture of a topless woman on a crucifix 
on the cover, co-produced by a photographer for President Jacques 
Chirac. Heeding a request by a conservative Catholic priest, the court 
ordered the book ``INRI'' was ordered off the shelves of three bookstores 
in Bordeaux, and the court threatened a 500-franc (dlrs 90) fine for 
each infraction. The book by Bettina Rheims and Serge Bramly re-examines 
iconography depicting the life of Jesus. Rheims, a popular shock-art 
photographer and celebrity portrait artist, shot the official picture 
of Chirac that hangs in government buildings across France. But Catholic 
priest Philippe Laguerie found the book's cover iconoclastic, and 
Presiding Judge Louis Montamat agreed, ruling that the cover, ``strongly 
shocks religious sentiment.'' French courts have banned a number of 
books in recent years, most recently going so far as to block an author 
from even writing an unauthorized biography of actor Alain Delon. 
The director of the FNAC department store in Bordeaux, Jean Benoit 
Cazenave, said the 390-franc (dlr 70) book published by Albin-Michel 
benefitted from the media coverage since it went on sale Friday and 
was already sold out. ``FNAC hopes to get the decision suspended,'' 
he said in a telephone interview. The company, he said, allows any 
book that doesn't include racial hatred, violence or pornography. 
``This book doesn't belong to any of those categories.'' Courts have 
also barred the sale of a book by a former doctor of the late President 
Francois Mitterrand that said the president lied about his cancer 
condition while in office. The order was circumvented when the book 
was placed on the Internet. Rheims, a former model, has become one 
of France's biggest contemporary photographers. Her work includes 
portraits of Elizabeth Hurley, Mickey Rourke, Johnny Depp and Liv 
Tyler as well as transexuals and strip tease artists. She's also produced 
TV ads, movie posters and music videos.
