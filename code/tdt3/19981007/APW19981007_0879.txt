John Whitaker on chestnut Virtual Village Heyman won the first test 
of the individual show-jumping event at the World Equestrian Games 
Wednesday and led Britain atop the team competition provisional standings. 
Simon Hugo of Austria was second on E.T. and Brazilian Nelson Pessoa 
on Gandini Baloubet du Rouet finished third. Whitaker's time was 83.11 
seconds, compared to Hugo's 84.69 and Pessoa's 87.61. The speed test 
is the show-jumping first competition, and its results count in both 
the individual and team standings. It is a time trial where fences 
and obstacles knocked down are converted into time and added to a 
rider's round. The U.S. best rider was Nona Garson, on chestnut Loro 
Piana Rhythmical, who placed 11th with 91.44 seconds. Fellow American 
Anne Kursinski, riding chestnut Eros, finished 12th, with 92.64. The 
individual show-jumping ends Sunday, with a spectacular final test 
where four finalists engage in a direct confrontation mounting each 
other's horses. On the teams' side, Britain's, with 10.82 penalties, 
heads the standings going into Thursday's team finals, followed by 
France, with 14.61 penalties, and United States, which totaled 16.41. 
The powerful German team, which aimed for gold after its victories 
at both the 1994 World Games in The Hague and 1996 Atlanta Olympics, 
finished fourth ahead of Brazil. The show-jumping event was held at 
the refurbished Flaminio stadium downtown the capital.
