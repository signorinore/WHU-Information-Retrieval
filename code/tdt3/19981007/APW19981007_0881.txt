Airports don't usually inspire affection, but Oslo's Fornebu international 
airport wasn't like most. When it closed Wednesday, some people mourned 
the loss of an old friend. ``Our beloved Fornebu. Just 59 years old, 
and torn away from us. You will be deeply missed,'' read the ribbon 
on a mourning wreath placed in the departure hall. ``I just had to 
come say good-bye to Fornebu. This is so sad,'' said 66-year-old Synnoeve 
Haavig, who worked at a nearby hotel for 25 years. ``Fornebu meant 
so much to me,'' she said as she knelt to take a photo of the wreath. 
Fornebu's charms included its setting, with a view over the Oslo Fjord; 
its location just a 15-minute cab ride from the center of the Norwegian 
capital; and its size _ cozy in comparison to the multi-terminal behemoths 
that bewilder passengers' brains and exhaust their legs. But its small 
size couldn't keep pace with the growing needs of the region, so a 
new airport was built at Gardermoen, 50 kilometers (30 miles) north 
of Oslo. The mourning wasn't unanimous. Many people were gleeful that 
jet airliners would finally stop thundering over their backyards and 
the idyllic islands that dot the fjord. Knut Christiansen, 81, has 
lived on an island near the end of the one runway since 1950, so close 
he can see passengers waving at him from the planes. On Wednesday, 
after 48 years of deafening takeoffs, he was celebrating the silence 
by ``just listening.'' Other nearby residents were holding outdoor 
celebrations, at last able to hear the noise of their own parties. 
Airports have stirred intense emotions in Norway for almost half a 
century. It took more than 30 years of heated debate, decisions, and 
reversals over a building site before Parliament finally picked Gardermoen 
on Oct. 8, 1992. Few question that Fornebu, already pressed to handle 
its 11 million passengers a year, was too small to handle air traffic 
that has tripled in 28 years. Gardermoen is designed for 17 million 
passengers annually, and can handle the jumbo jets that were too big 
for Fornebu. Fornebu opened in June 1939, tragically convenient for 
Nazi troops arriving to occupy Norway less than a year later in World 
War II. After nearly six decades of expansion, makeshift modifications 
and wear, it is cramped, complicated and a little shabby. But some 
say it had charm, and the airport in the suburb of Baerum was convenient, 
just 15 minutes by cab from downtown Oslo. The trip to Gardermoen 
will be much longer, by car over congested roads or by a high-speed 
train. At 7 p.m. (1700 GMT), the last airliner was to take off from 
Fornebu, a packed SAS flight to Bergen. Afterwards, in a final salute 
to Fornebu, air traffic controllers would turn runway lights up to 
their brightest setting, and then slowly dim them until they vanish. 
That would also mark the start of a hectic, all-night dash by hundreds 
of trucks moving everything from Fornebu to Gardermoren, which is 
to open 12 hours later. The closing operations, including sales by 
airport shops, were complicated because Braathens airline, Norway's 
major domestic carrier, being grounded by a pilots strike over terms 
of their move to Gardermoen. In its final hours, the old airport was 
a whirlwind of confused passengers seeking alternative flights, moving 
crews carting equipment, shop clerks packing, shoppers seeking bargains, 
well-wishers bidding farewell and a few sad employees. ``I started 
work here in 1963, so my whole life has been here at Fornebu,'' Sissel 
Mustand, of SAS, was quoted as telling the Norwegian news agency NTB. 
``One of my colleagues summed up what many of us feel today in one 
word: sorrow.''
