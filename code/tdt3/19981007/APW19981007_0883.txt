Canadian ice hockey player Stephane Morin collapsed during a German 
league game and died, apparently of a heart problem, his club Berlin 
Capitals said Wednesday. Morin, 29, left the ice early in the second 
period complaining that he was feeling ill late Tuesday. Shortly afterward, 
the forward collapsed unconscious in the team's box, apparently from 
a heart attack, Berlin Capitals spokesman Peter Harbig said. Doctors 
on the scene tried to revive Morin but were unsuccessful. He was taken 
to a hospital where doctors pronounced him dead. The Berlin team's 
physician, Thorsten Dolla, said Morin had been examined two months 
ago and was pronounced healthy. Later, it was discovered that Morin 
periodically suffered from asthma symptoms, although he had no acute 
problems, Dolla said. Dolla said doctors would perform an autopsy. 
A police spokesman in Oberhausen, the town where Morin died, said 
his death could have been the consequence of a heart attack that went 
undetected a few years earlier. Morin also suffered from chronic bronchitis, 
he said. Morin had scored the final of three goals for the Capitals 
in the first period of their game at Revier Lions in Oberhausen, in 
the Ruhr Valley. The game was stopped after Morin's collapse. Morin, 
who had played for Quebec Nordiques and Vancouver Canucks in the NHL, 
was born in Montreal. He also had played in the AHL and IHL. He is 
survived by his wife Karen and son Frederick, 2. The club will turn 
all television earnings for the fatal game to Morin's widow, and will 
also play a charity game to raise money for the family. Morin is the 
second Canadian ice hockey player to die in Germany this year. Mark 
Teevens died in April of a long embolism while watching his Bad Neuheim 
team play a game. Three German athletes also have died suddenly this 
year _ bobsled driver Lars Bolte, soccer player Axel Jueptner and 
shot putter Ralf Reichenbach.
