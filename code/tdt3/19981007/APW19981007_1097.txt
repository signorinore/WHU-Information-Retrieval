A Chilean activist fighting to save the Bio Bio River and an American 
cancer-prevention specialist were named Wednesday as among the winners 
of the Right Livelihood Awards, commonly called the ``alternative 
Nobels.'' The four awards, each worth 450,000 kronor (dlrs 58,500), 
went to Juan Pablo Orrego of Chile; Samuel Epstein of the University 
of Illinois-Chicago; the London-based International Baby Food Action 
Netowrk; and Croatian peace activists Katarina Kruhonja and Vesna 
Terselic. The recipients all ``are engaged in the global struggle 
to put limits on corporate power,'' awards founder Jakob von Uexkull 
said at a news conference. Orrego helped found the Grupo de Accion 
por el Bio Bio in 1991, to work against plans by the Chilean energy 
company ENDESA to build a series of six dams on the spectacular river. 
``The campaign work has, in a rlatively short time, been remarkably 
successful, enabling GABB to make the previously secret plans for 
dam construction a hot issue of environment, human rights and to question 
the present development model in Chile,'' the awards foundation said. 
Epstein, a prefessor of occupational and enviromental medicine, is 
chairman of the Cancer Prevention Coalition, which works to prevent 
exposure to carcinogens in air, water, food and the workplace. The 
award also noted CPC's research indicating that milk and meat from 
cattle treated with synthetic hormones can cause cancer. IBFAN ``brought 
together non-governmental organizations which were addressing infant 
feeding ... in a common aim: improving breastfeeding rates, reducing 
dependence on industrial artificial milk products, and protecting 
families' freedom of choice,'' the foundation said. Terselic, found 
of the Croatian Anti-War Campaign, and Kruhonja, director of the Center 
for Peace, Non-violence and Human Rights in the city of Osijek, are 
both working to heal the post-war tensions in Croatia. Von Uexkull 
sold an extensive stamp collection to provide seed money for the awards, 
which are aimed at recognizing work that he and the Right Livelihood 
Foundation believe gets ignored by the more-famous Nobel Prizes. ``We 
are a complement to the Nobel Prizes _ and a compliment'' because 
establishing the Right Livelihood Awards was a recognition of the 
Nobels' prestige, von Uexkull said. The awards began in 1980 and have 
acquired a substantial amount of prestige. The winners will receive 
the prizes in a ceremony in the Swedish Parliament on Dec. 9, the 
day before the Nobel Prizes are presented in Stockholm. The jury for 
this year's prize included von Uexkull, Richard Jolly of the United 
Nations Development Program and Sweden's ambassador to Zambia Kristina 
Svensson.
