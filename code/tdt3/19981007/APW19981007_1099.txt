David Duval was one of the biggest names in the field when he arrived 
at the Michelob Championship a year ago. On Thursday, he returns as 
one of the biggest names in the game, a three-time winner on the PGA 
Tour for the second consecutive season and the tour's leading money-winner 
with more than dlrs 2.1 million in 1998. And it all started at Kingsmill, 
where his 10-foot birdie putt on the first hole of a three-way playoff 
earned him his first tour victory a year ago. ``It was my first win, 
and I'll always be able to go back with confidence and some great 
memories,'' Duval said of the 6,797-yard (6,185-meter) River Course, 
which served as the springboard to his remarkable 1997 finish. Duval 
followed his breakthrough victory with another the following week 
at Walt Disney World, then became the first player in history to post 
his first three victories in succession by winning the Tour Championship. 
The streak vaulted him into second place on the season's final money 
list, right behind Tiger Woods. Apparently, it was only the beginning. 
He's the only three-time winner on tour this season, finished in a 
tie for second in the Masters and was seventh in the U.S. Open. With 
more than dlrs 4 million in earnings the last two years, the major 
thing still missing from Duval's resume is just that _ a victory in 
a major. ``You look at my record and that's the obvious next step 
for me,'' he said. ``I've got to give myself more than one chance 
a year.'' The versatility of his game seems to suggest it's just a 
matter of time. Duval ranks first in putting average, second in scoring 
average and seventh in greens hit in regulation _ taking care of the 
finesse part of the game. He's also sixth in average driving distance. 
The field this weekend also includes Duffy Waldorf and Grant Waite, 
who lost in the playoff last year; Scott Hoch, the wire-to-wire winner 
in 1996, and a host of players who already have won major championships. 
That group includes Justin Leonard, who last year missed the cut; 
Payne Stewart, Lee Janzen, Jeff Sluman, host Curtis Strange and Tom 
Lehman. Lehman hasn't played here since 1992, when he finished fifth. 
He's hoping to regain his form after separating a shoulder in July. 
``I planned on playing here all year,'' Lehman said. ``I expect to 
come here quite often if it's held this time of year.'' Until last 
year, the tournament was held in July, when the weather made it one 
of the hottest stops on the tour. It also fell the week before the 
British Open, and many top players skipped it and headed for Europe 
early.
