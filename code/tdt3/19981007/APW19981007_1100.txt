Top seeds Pete Sampras and Patrick Rafter both crashed out in the 
first round of the dlrs 1 million Swiss Indoors on Wednesday. Sampras, 
winner of three titles this season including Wimbledon, was toppled 
by long-time nemesis Wayne Ferreira 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 only hours 
after Rafter was eliminated in straight sets by Czech Daniel Vacek. 
``I'm very disappointed,'' said Sampras, who accepted a wildcard in 
Basel in an effort to finish as world No. 1 in the rankings this year. 
``It can't get much worse than this. ``I'm sitting here trying to 
regroup and wondering hey, what happened?'' said Sampras. ``I only 
arrived two days ago, and now I'm going home tomorrow.'' Playing for 
the first time since he was knocked out in the semifinal of the U.S. 
Open last month by eventual champion Rafter, Sampras got off to a 
strong start but slowly began to crumble under Ferreira's persistant 
assault. ``I was a set up and then all of sudden it was the tie-break 
and I lost,'' said Sampras, the winner of 11 Grand Slams. ``Then I 
just lost a couple of key points. I don't really know how it happened.'' 
Ferreira, in contrast, seemed to know exactly the cause of Sampras' 
downfall. ``He started off strong and was playing well,'' said Ferreira, 
who's won the last four times the two have met. ``But when I broke 
him in the second set I could see him getting down on himself. ``If 
you can start strong and answer his serves, he puts more in his serve 
and it goes a little off,'' explained Ferreira. ``The key is to keep 
your serve so you have a chance to get ahead by returning his.'' Sampras' 
last win over Ferreira dates back to 1995 when he defeated the South 
African in the quarterfinals in Hamburg. Since then, Ferreira has 
remained a thorn in the American's side, and leads their head-to-head 
record with five wins and four defeats. ``I like the way he plays,'' 
said Ferreira. ``I've heard he hates playing me so I'm sure that doesn't 
help him. ``Maybe I should play him every week.'' Ferreira will play 
Marc Rosset in the second round, while Sampras boards the plane to 
return home to prepare for tournaments in Lyon, Stuttgart, Paris and 
the ATP Tour World Championship in Hannover. In the day's other shocker, 
two-time U.S. Open champion Rafter surrendered 7-6 (9-7), 7-5 to Vacek, 
ranked 44. Serving well but laboring in his return game, Rafter seemed 
to struggle on the indoor carpet. Playing in only his first tournament 
since successfully defending his title at Flushing Meadows a month 
ago, the 25-year-old Australian showed only brief glimpses of the 
talent which led him to six titles this season. ``There were only 
one or two key points in the match and they didn't go my way,'' said 
Rafter, currently leading the race for berths in Hannover next month. 
``But that's often the case in indoors. ``My game is more suited to 
hard court, and if I want to become world No.1 I'll have to learn 
how to play on all surfaces.'' Sampras' and Rafter's elimination marks 
the departure of the tournament's biggest draws and all three Grand 
Slam champions present this year. Petr Korda, the Australian Open 
champion, went out in the first round on Tuesday after losing 6-2, 
6-4 to Germany's Nicolas Kiefer. Always a top attraction, wildcard 
Boris Becker also made an early exit, losing 6-3, 6-2 to Sweden's 
Thomas Johansson on Wednesday. In other first round play, seventh-seed 
Greg Rusedski began the defence of his crown with a 6-2, 6-2 victory 
over German qualifier Axel Pretzsch, ranked 311. Returning to form 
after a two-month absence to nurse ankle ligaments he tore at Queens 
in June, Rusedski needed just 52 minutes to steamroll past Pretzsch. 
Ranked 14, Rusedski, who has only lost one match in 10 in Basel, will 
take on another German qualifier, David Prinosil, in the second round.
