A top aide to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic blasted NATO threats 
of military intervention on Wednesday as a ``criminal act, inconceivable 
in international law.'' Dragan Tomic, chairman of the Serbian parliament, 
speaking at a meeting of a Belgrade branch of his and Milosevic's 
ruling Socialist party, said the party fully supports the federal 
president's stand that in case of attack the country would ``defend 
with all means.'' The official Tanjug news agency quoted Tomic as 
saying the NATO threats are ``based on fabricated disinformation, 
causing revolt among Serbian people and at the same time bringing 
unprecedented unity, expressed in complete consent of all relevant 
political parties'' in protesting against the threats. Commenting 
on Russia's opposition to the looming intervention, Tomic said: ``Russia 
has recognized (in the NATO threats) what might happen to it one day 
if this experiment, this pilot project, with us, succeeds.'' A top 
Russian delegation visited Belgrade this weekend in an apparent effort 
to offset the NATO threats of strikes which may happen unless Milosevic 
pulls out his troops from Serbia's Kosovo province where his forces 
are battling ethnic Albanian separatists. ``Numerous states in Russia 
that are rich in oil and natural resources have ethnically diverse 
populations and are targets of plans by new imperialists headed by 
the United States of America,'' Tomic said.
