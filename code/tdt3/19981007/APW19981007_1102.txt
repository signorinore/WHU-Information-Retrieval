Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday criticized 
what he described as conspirators misusing freedom of expression and 
said their actions amounted to treason, the Islamic Republic News 
Agency reported. ``Critique and criticism of the government's policies 
are not bad, but, when someone attempts to undermine the foundations 
of the government, it is a treason and not freedom of expression... 
The enemy's hands are seen in such practices,'' the agency quoted 
Khamenei as saying. In recent months, hard-liners at the judiciary 
have shut down six publications, including two on Monday, and arrested 
six journalists for allegedly printing lies. The New York-based Human 
Rights Watch said it feared that four detained journalists working 
for the banned Tous daily were being ``ill-treated in order to pressure 
them to sign false confessions.'' It said the four men _ Mahmoud Shamsol-va-Ezine, 
Hamid-Reza Jalaipur, Mohammad Javadi-Hessar and Ebrahim Nabavi _ have 
been held incommunicado since their arrest Sept. 16 with no access 
to their lawyers and their families. The watch group said in an open-letter 
to Mohammad Yazdi, the head of Iran's judiciary, that the arrests 
appeared to be in ``direct violation'' of Iran's Constitution which 
states that any offenses relating to the press should be brought before 
a designated press court. It said the Iranian press law stipulates 
that such courts should hold their proceedings in public and in the 
presence of a jury. The group said it was concerned that ``the prosecution 
of the four journalists is part of a campaign of repression and violence 
targeting independent media.'' Tous, a popular independent daily, 
was shut down for allegedly publishing articles ``detrimental to national 
interests.'' Tous angered hard-liners with its anti-war stance by 
calling for a diplomatic solution rather than military strikes in 
the conflict with the Taliban militia in Afghanistan. It also angered 
hard-liners by questioning Khamenei's authority as the spiritual leader. 
In addition to Tous, five other publications have been shut down, 
including Gozaresh-e Rouz, Khaneh, Rah-e Nou, Tavana, Jameah-e Salem 
and Asr-e Ma. The crackdown is stymying efforts by moderate President 
Mohammad Khatami to give more freedom to the press. Journalists say 
they are the victims of powerful hard-liners in the regime, who have 
found themselves under increasing attack by an increasingly daring 
press. Khamenei has in the past called on the judiciary to deal with 
what he described as ``the abuse of press freedom'' by the media. 
``We have said time and again that expressing views on every issue 
is free and those having objections to the government's plans are 
entitled to publish their objections and no one will stop them. But 
there exists a fundamental difference between objection and sabotage,'' 
IRNA quoted Khamenei as saying Wednesday. ``If anyone today undermines 
the economy and the work of this government _ this government which 
is the servant of the people _ he is our enemy. We must confront him,'' 
he said.
