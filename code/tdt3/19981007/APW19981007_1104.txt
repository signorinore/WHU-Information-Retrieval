As Scotty Bowman recuperates from knee surgery, interim co-coaches 
Dave Lewis and Barry Smith are winning rave reviews from the Red Wings' 
front office. Things are going well, says general manager Ken Holland. 
``It's worked out thus far, and it'll continue to work smoothly,'' 
Holland said. ``They've done a wonderful job of handling training 
camp. I expect it to continue into the regular season.'' Players agree. 
``Barry and Dave have the respect of everyone on this team,'' Kris 
Draper said. ``They've done this before.'' During training camp, Lewis 
and Smith did things the way they always do. Lewis worked the defensemen 
and Smith the forwards, and then shared the bench during the games. 
The only difference was, Bowman was nowhere near the camp. In the 
past four years, he was somewhere in the arena analyzing the exhibition 
games. The Wings will start the National Hockey League regular season 
Saturday at Toronto without Bowman. ``It's like having two head coaches 
behind the bench,'' Holland told The Detroit News. ``They work extremely 
well together.'' Lewis and Smith will consult with Bowman and Holland 
to formulate lineups before games. Lewis and Smith then will design 
a pregame strategy, setting forward lines and defensive pairings. 
Smith is responsible for sending the forwards out, Lewis the defensemen. 
Decisions such as pulling a goalie or who will take a key faceoff 
will be shared. But there will be much discussion and preparation 
before the game to make sure every option is considered. ``We know 
what these guys can do,'' Lewis said. ``It's our job to put them into 
situations where they can do their best.'' Holland agreed. ``The important 
thing is have the correct personnel on the ice,'' he said. ``There's 
quick decisions that need to be made, quick adjustments to make. They 
have to be on the same page.''
