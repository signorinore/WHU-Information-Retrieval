A Frankfurt state court on Wednesday acquitted a Swiss couple of obstruction 
of justice charges for their part in helping a bankrupt German building 
tycoon flee Germany to Miami in 1994. Mostafa und Myrta El Kastaui, 
accepted payment from construction tycoon Juergen Schneider to arrange 
his trip and hideout in the United States, but the couple did not 
realize they were breaking any laws by working for Schneider, the 
court ruled. Prosecutors insisted the couple intentionally tried to 
conceal Schneider's whereabouts, and said they would appeal the verdict. 
Schneider and his wife, Claudia, fled Germany in April 1994, when 
his company was forced into bankruptcy. They were arrested in Miami 
in May 1995 and extradited to Germany in February 1996. Schneider, 
64, was convicted on five counts of serious fraud for falsifying documents 
to convince banks his properties were worth much more than their true 
value to obtain huge loans. He was sentenced to six years and nine 
months in prison by a Frankfurt court in December. Schneider's concern 
collapsed with 5 billion marks (dlrs 2.8 billion) in debt, nearly 
one-third of it with Deutsche Bank, his main creditor.
