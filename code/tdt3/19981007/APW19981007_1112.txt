American peacekeepers in Bosnia take ``very seriously'' threats of 
retaliation in the event NATO launches airstrikes against neighboring 
Yugoslavia, officials said Wednesday. Gen. Kevin P. Byrnes, who assumed 
command of the American-run northern sector of Bosnia on Wednesday, 
said his soldiers are well prepared to defend themselves and react 
in case of hostile actions. Protecting the hundreds or thousands of 
American civilians in Bosnia could be more difficult. The contingent 
of 8,500 U.S. troops stands out as a likely target if Serb hardliners 
carry through on threats to fight back following any bombing attack 
by the American-led alliance, which is trying to halt Serbia's crackdown 
on secessionist Kosovo province. Hardliners in both Yugoslavia and 
Bosnia, who share the goal of a Greater Serbia, have pledged to respond 
to air raids with their own, unspecified attacks. Porous borders and 
the lack of a professional local police force mean retaliatory action 
against Americans could have a bigger impact in Bosnia than in Yugoslavia. 
``We have heard, through reports, about these threats and we take 
them very seriously,'' said Maj. Jim Jones, a spokesman for the American 
peacekeeping contingent. While intelligence-gathering is almost certain 
to have been stepped up as a result, American officers and soldiers 
remained mum on the subject Wednesday. Jones said there were no plans 
to increase security _ which in any event is ``our first priority 
at any time,'' he stressed. Daily activities appeared to be as usual 
around this northern Bosnian town. Humvees and trucks painted in camouflage 
colors roared down Bosnian roads while foot patrols kept watch as 
usual despite rainy weather. Caution is already built into their routine. 
Located up a narrow, winding road about 16 kilometers (10 miles) southeast 
of Tuzla, the site of Eagle Base itself signals a wariness of potential 
attacks. In addition, strict security rules require Americans to move 
in patrols of no fewer than six when outside the base. NATO officials 
do not expect the soldiers to be targeted because of their numbers 
and firepower. More at risk are so-called liaison officers, who live 
in communities alongside Bosnians in order to instill confidence and 
monitor any problems. Even more vulnerable are the American civilians 
in Bosnia who work mostly for aid agencies, reconstruction organizations 
or the U.S. government. Last weekend, the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo 
issued a travel advisory warning American citizens of possible Serb 
retaliation. Due to the ``potential increased danger,'' the advisory 
urged all Americans in Bosnia to consider leaving the Serb-held half 
of the country, or at least to try to avoid traveling through it. 
This has already caused some inconvenience for some U.S. employees 
based in the other half of Bosnia _ the Muslim-Croat Federation. By 
heeding the advisory, they often must travel for several additional 
hours in order to skirt areas dominated by Serbs. In the Bosnian Serb 
republic itself, officials for the U.S. Agency for International Development 
denied reports it had pulled out American stafff but said some other 
American contractors may have left.
