Despite requests by the United States to halt Jewish settlement construction, 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu conferred city status Wednesday 
to Ariel, a large West Bank settlement slated for expansion. Netanyahu's 
visit to Ariel came just hours after U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright left the region after talks with Israeli and Palestinian 
leaders over a long-delayed Israeli pullback from part of the West 
Bank. ``We are building and will continue to build,'' Netanyahu said 
to cheering crowds of settlers in Ariel. ``When we declare Ariel as 
a city, as we do today, we thus announce that this is a permanent 
place. This place will be part of Israel in any final status agreement 
in the future,'' Netanyahu said, indicating Ariel would remain under 
Israeli sovereignty. Ariel, established in 1977, is in the middle 
of the West Bank, 30 kilometers (18 miles) east of Tel Aviv. Ariel's 
mayor, Ron Nachman, told The Associated Press that there are plans 
to increase the population from 17,000 to 30,000 by building 3,000 
new housing units. In addition, Netanyahu said a new cultural center 
would be built and Ariel's community college would be expanded into 
a university. Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said Wednesday's ceremony 
was scheduled long ago, ``and was certainly not timed to coincide 
with Mrs. Albright's visit here.'' Nachman, an opponent of the Israeli-Palestinian 
autonomy accords, said the ceremony of declaring Ariel a city sends 
a message that Israel must strengthen its presence in the West Bank. 
For more than two decades, U.S. governments have said Israeli settlements 
in the West Bank are illegal and obstacles to peace. Palestinians 
say the settlements are illegal incursions on land Israel captured 
from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war and where they hope to establish 
a state. Netanyahu said the new homes do not violate peace accords 
with the Palestinians. ``We are not building new settlements, but 
we are enabling the natural growth of the existing settlements to 
go on,'' Netanyahu said. ``I would like to see Ariel double in size. 
We will continue at this pace and build up this city more and more 
and more,'' he said. Nachman said 400 new apartments will be ready 
in April. He said Ariel has permission to build 2,600 additional units, 
but that because of a slump in the building industry the work has 
not begun. Approval for the 3,000 units was given before 1992, when 
Israel's previous, moderate government announced a freeze on construction 
in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. One of the first 
moves of Netanyahu's government in 1996 was to cancel the freeze. 
Israel's ``Peace Now'' movement, which advocates an Israeli withdrawal 
from most of the West Bank in exchange for peace with the Palestinians, 
is planning a demonstration across from Ariel while the ceremony is 
in progress. A Peace Now statement said that ``Netanyahu is spitting 
in Madeleine Albright's face'' by attending the ceremony. ``He is 
trying his best to sabotage the peace process,'' the group said. Meanwhile, 
in the tensely divided West Bank city of Hebron, Israeli Transportation 
Minister Shaul Yahalom laid a cornerstone for future construction 
at the Tel Romeida Jewish settlement. One month ago, a rabbi from 
the community was stabbed to death in his trailer home there and the 
government agreed to build permanent homes for several families who 
live there. ``I hope there will be a permanent neighborhood here, 
one with dozens of homes,'' Yahalom said at the ceremony.
