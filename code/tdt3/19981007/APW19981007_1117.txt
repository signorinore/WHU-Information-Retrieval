Tara Lipinski never expected the backlash, and all the questions about 
why a 15-year-old Olympic champion would abandon competitive figure 
skating for show business. ``It hurt. It bothers you,'' says Lipinski, 
whose surge to the top of the sport was capped by her gold-medal performance 
at the Nagano Games last February. ``But you've got to be strong. 
It helps me to be out there with the fans. I know that not everyone 
feels that way, especially the fans. ``I think the people who were 
criticizing me are not in the position to understand how it works. 
They have not gone through 12 years of training and living away from 
their dad for five years. ``The reasons for becoming a professional 
were obvious to me. It was what's best for me and my family. I don't 
think I made any really wrong decisions in my career before and there 
is nothing to make me think this was wrong.'' Lipinski recently completed 
rehearsals for Discover Stars on Ice, the touring show that also stars 
Scott Hamilton and Kristi Yamaguchi. She and fellow Nagano gold medalist 
Ilia Kulik joined the tour during the summer, along with three-time 
U.S. pairs champions Jenni Meno and Todd Sand, two-time Olympic bronze 
medalist Lu Chen of China, and England's Steven Cousins. The first 
few days of rehearsals were agonizing. Lipinski was bothered by an 
injured hip and sore thighs, causing a slight limp. But it was idleness 
_ not injuries _ that troubled her most. She was kept off the ice 
because the initial practices did not involve her numbers and because 
tour organizers were cautious about her health. ``I was sitting up 
here watching them,'' she said from a lounge while watching show choreographers 
Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean and producer Sandra Bezic work 
on a routine. ``It was like, `When can I get on the ice with everybody?' 
``I couldn't wait to do the group numbers. I knew that would be the 
most fun, to be out there with Scott and Kristi and Ilia and everybody.'' 
Those group numbers, the highlight of Stars on Ice since Hamilton 
started the tour 12 years ago, were a major reason Lipinski joined 
the show. When she was much younger, Lipinski was a roller skater 
and most enjoyed the ``family things'' and ensemble performances that 
accompanied that sport. ``I love to be an entertainer,'' said Lipinski, 
now 16 and in possession of a driver's license _ she has three automobiles 
thanks to endorsement contracts. ``What I'd wanted to do next was 
interpret music and act and do so much more than I did before.'' She 
gets the opportunity in this year's show, appearing in a clown routine 
in which she even is lifted up by another skater. And she will be 
doing some acting for CBS, with which she has an exclusive contract 
that includes skating shows and non-sanctioned competitions. But for 
all the tour's family atmosphere and focus on entertainment, Lipinski 
still gets a competitive charge. ``Performing every night on tour 
will satisfy my competitive juices,'' she said. ``I won't miss anything. 
``Once you've accomplished what you set out to do, you don't miss 
it. It's over. After I won worlds (in 1997), the ultimate goal was 
the Olympics. I still had the drive within me to get the Olympic medal 
and then that was fulfilled. ``The Olympics changed my whole life. 
At the moment I won, it was, `It's yours forever. You don't have to 
give it up.' When I look at the medal, it's so awesome.''
