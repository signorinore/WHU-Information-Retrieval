Electronic commerce is projected to mushroom into a trillion-dollar 
global phenomenon by 2005, yet vital questions about security and 
reliability trouble many businesses and consumers. In one of the most 
ambitious attempts yet to ease those doubts, delegates from 29 of 
the world's wealthiest countries opened a three-day conference on 
electronic commerce Wednesday. Sponsored by the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development, the meeting is an unprecedented get-together 
of government officials and private-sector executives seeking to figure 
out who should regulate global electronic commerce _ and how. Rifts 
already have developed between countries favoring government intervention 
in protecting consumer interests and those who believe initiatives 
should be industry-led. The European Union, Canada and much of Asia 
advocate regulation to protect personal information on the Internet. 
The EU is preparing to prohibit the transmission of sensitive data 
to countries that do not adopt adequate privacy laws. The United States, 
on the other hand, is campaigning for voluntary private-sector codes 
of conduct. ``It would be very bureaucratic for governments to try 
and set up enforcement mechanisms and it would stifle the development 
of electronic commerce,'' Ira Magaziner, an adviser to President Bill 
Clinton, said in a pre-conference briefing. ``We don't feel you can 
effectively protect privacy that way. We think you're in a sense misleading 
your people because you're saying: `Don't worry, we'll protect your 
privacy,' when in effect you can't.'' The challenge of the conference 
will be to find common ground. ``If each country works independently 
to establish its own system, it could cripple the potential for international 
electronic commerce,'' said Canada's industry minister, John Manley. 
Top corporate executives will be trying to drive home the importance 
of reaching an international agreement. ``Unless you bring people 
together like this, it will be very difficult to build consensus,'' 
said David Seibel, a managing partner with Andersen Consulting Canada. 
``We see a cooperative regulatory environment as one of the critical 
factors that's required to support the development of the electronic 
economy.'' Ministers will be tackling other issues besides regulation, 
including standards on encryption technology, agreement on intellectual 
property protection and how to collect taxes on electronic transactions.
