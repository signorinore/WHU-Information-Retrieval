A British tourist shot during a hotel robbery in Barbados last week 
has not been cleared to return home, a hospital official said Wednesday. 
In a written statement, Andrew Watson, director of Bridgetown's Queen 
Elizabeth Hospital, said a decision on whether to airlift Paula Bridges 
of Suffolk, England, ``has yet to be determined by the medical staff.'' 
Bridges was shot in the chest during a robbery Thursday in the bar 
of the Palm Garden Hotel, where she was staying. The bullet penetrated 
her heart, doctors said. ``This was a potentially fatal condition 
which necessitated emergency surgery,'' Watson said. ``Her condition 
has stabilized, but she remains ill and is on (respiratory) support.'' 
Reports differed on whether the robbers shot toward bar patrons to 
frighten them or if Bridges was hit by a ricocheting bullet. Simon 
Baptiste, assistant police commissioner, denied reports that Bridges 
was shot at point-blank range or singled out by the assailants. Albert 
Carter, a spokesman for police department, said the robbers may be 
linked to several hold-ups in Barbados in recent weeks. Investigators 
believe the hotel attackers robbed a gasoline station after the latest 
shooting. ``We are pursuing all leads and leaving no stone unturned,'' 
Carter said. On Wednesday, the Barbados Advocate newspaper published 
a statement by Bridges' common-law husband, John Martin, urging residents 
to aid police. ``Help them to apprehend the offenders before anyone 
else has to go through the horrifying experience Paula and myself 
have,'' Martin said. He said he was ``overwhelmed'' by expressions 
of sympathy from Barbadian residents. Officials in Barbados, a Caribbean 
island of 264,000 people, say they are worried about an recent increase 
in gun use. Between July 3 and mid-August there were 14 crimes involving 
firearms, including three murders the night of Aug. 9. The government 
increased the penalty for illegal possession of firearms from two 
years in prison to 20 years.
