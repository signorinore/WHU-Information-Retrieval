An Austrian tennis promoter has made an offer to buy the Pilot Pen 
International men's tennis tournament, ending its eight-year run in 
the city as a warm-up for the U.S. Open. An offer is on the table 
to purchase the men's event from Tournament Chairman Butch Buchholz, 
Mike Davies, chief executive officer of the Pilot Pen International 
men's and women's tournaments, told the New Haven Register. The decision-making 
process is not complete, Davies said. Davies last week told the aldermanic 
Tax Abatement Committee that the tournament lost about dlrs 1 million 
in 1997 and another dlrs 1.3 million after introducing the women's 
tournament this year. The committee tabled any decision on the tournament's 
request to abate dlrs 417,000 in payments in lieu of taxes, apparently 
because of the offer. Mayor John DeStefano Jr., who is both a member 
of the Connecticut Tennis Foundation board of directors and its first 
executive director, said he does not expect the men's tournament to 
return. ``The event has lost money over the last three or four years 
_ it has lost a lot of money,'' DeStefano said. ``The fan support 
was weak this year. And what also is evident, frankly, is that the 
women have been a lot more popular in their appearances here in New 
Haven.'' The women's tournament, which outdrew the men's tournament 
in its initial run this past August, will remain in the Connecticut 
Tennis Center, officials said. The center, which was the third largest 
tennis stadium in the world at the time of its completion in 1991, 
was built with dlrs 18 million in state funds specifically to house 
the tournament. But DeStefano said there's nothing wrong with a stadium 
that's only used one week a year. ``It's a tennis stadium for professional 
tennis,'' he said. ``That's what it was built for. That's what it 
is. Show me a professional tennis stadium that's used more often than 
this one.'' The tournament in Kitzbuhel, Austria is a clay court event. 
It took place this year from July 27-Aug. 2. Buying rights to the 
dlrs 870,000 Pilot Pen International essentially would upgrade the 
dlrs 525,000 Kitzbuhel event.
