Hours after U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright asked Israel 
and the Palestinians to refrain from unilateral actions, Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday he would continue to build in Jewish 
settlements. Netanyahu spoke in Ariel several hours after talks with 
Albright and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat over a long-delayed 
Israeli pullback from part of the West Bank. ``We are building and 
will continue to build,'' Netanyahu said to cheering crowds of settlers 
in Ariel, where he conferred city status on the large settlement slated 
for expansion. ``When we declare Ariel as a city, as we do today, 
we thus announce that this is a permanent place. This place will be 
part of Israel in any final status agreement in the future,'' Netanyahu 
said, indicating Ariel would remain under Israeli sovereignty. Ariel, 
established in 1977, is in the middle of the West Bank, 30 kilometers 
(18 miles) east of Tel Aviv. Ariel's mayor, Ron Nachman told The Associated 
Press that there are plans to increase the population of the city 
from 17,000 to 30,000 by building 3,000 new housing units. In addition, 
Netanyahu said a new cultural center would be built and Ariel's community 
college would be expanded into a university. Netanyahu adviser David 
Bar-Illan said Wednesday's ceremony was scheduled long ago, ``and 
was certainly not timed to coincide with Mrs. Albright's visit here.'' 
For more than two decades, U.S. governments have said Israeli settlements 
in the West Bank are illegal and obstacles to peace between Israel. 
Albright has called for a halt in settlement construction and Wednesday 
said unilateral moves would hurt chances for peace. Palestinians denounce 
the settlements as illegal incursions on land Israel captured from 
Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war and where they hope to establish a 
Palestinian state. Netanyahu said the new homes do not violate peace 
accords with the Palestinians. ``We are not building new settlements, 
but we are enabling the natural growth of the existing settlements 
to go on,'' Netanyahu said. ``I would like to see Ariel double in 
size. We will continue at this pace and build up this city more and 
more and more,'' Netanyahu said. Nachman said 400 new apartments will 
be ready for occupancy in April. He said Ariel has permission to build 
2,600 additional units, but that because of a slump in the building 
industry work has not begun. Approval for the 3,000 units was given 
before 1992, when Israel's previous, moderate government announced 
a freeze on construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and 
Gaza. One of the first moves of Netanyahu's government in 1996 was 
to cancel the freeze. Israel's ``Peace Now'' movement, which advocates 
an Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank in exchange for peace 
with the Palestinians, held a demonstration across from Ariel while 
the ceremony was in progress. A Peace Now statement said that ``Netanyahu 
is spitting in Madeleine Albright's face'' by attending the ceremony. 
``He is trying his best to sabotage the peace process,'' the group 
said. Meanwhile, in the tensely divided West Bank city of Hebron, 
Israeli Transportation Minister Shaul Yahalom laid a cornerstone for 
future construction at the Tel Romeida Jewish settlement. One month 
ago, a rabbi from the community was stabbed to death in his trailer 
home there and the government agreed to build permanent homes for 
several families who live there. ``I hope there will be a permanent 
neighborhood here, one with dozens of homes,'' Yahalom said at the 
ceremony.
