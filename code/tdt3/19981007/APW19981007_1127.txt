Fluminense, once one of Rio's premier teams and a favorite of the 
city's elite, suffered its greatest humiliation falling into the third 
division after a 1-1 tie against ABC of Natal. The team, which won 
the national championships in 1984 under the command of coach Carlos 
Alberto Parreira, had fallen on hard times recently after being relegated 
to the second division after last year. And with Tuesday night's tie 
the team finds itself in an even deeper hole, because the third division 
only plays for a few months out of the year, cutting down potential 
revenue. The team will now likely have to lay off its better players. 
Badly mismanaged and with many of their players unpaid since May, 
the team was a ghost of what they were in their glory days when players 
like Branco and Romerito played for the team. Recently, the team had 
been appealing to friends to bring them back from the brink _ at one 
point they even asked former-FIFA president and Fluminense board member 
Joao Havelange to head the team. The drop to third division left the 
teams 2.4 million fans, one of the biggest fan clubs in the city, 
in a state of despair.
