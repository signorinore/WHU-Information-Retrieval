"Headline News." I'm David Goodnow. The United States will make another 
attempt Wednesday to end the bloodshed in Kosovo. Envoy Richard Holbrooke 
met with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic Tuesday and made no 
progress toward stopping Serbian attacks on ethnic Albanians in the 
province. With that, the possibility of NATO air strikes increases. 
Carl Rochelle reports. Some Serb forces may have pulled back from 
Kosovo, but President Clinton and other NAto leaders are not convinced 
that Yugoslav President Milosevic plans to remove all his forces and 
allow refugees to return. If the violence continues it could spill 
over and threaten the peace and stability of Bosnia, Albania, of Macedonia 
and other countries in the region. What is already a humanitarian 
crisis could turn into a catastrophe. Special envoy Richard Holbrooke, 
in the region carried a message to President Milosevic -- time is 
running out. And on Capitol Hill, the U.S. military was telling Congress 
-- Action has to be taken to prevent 50,000 people from freezing or 
starving to death and we would like to take that action but limited 
to the air operation. Pentagon sources say the U.S. is prepared to 
commit between 200 and 300 aircraft, including F-15s and F-16s for 
possible strikes. Many of the planes are already in the area, but 
F-117s and B-52s, with air launched cruise missiles, would have to 
be flown from the U.S. also available, the aircraft carrier "Eisenhower" 
currently in the Mediterranean along with nine ships capable of launching 
cruise missiles, which would probably make up the first wave of the 
attack. Officials familiar with intelligence reports from Kosovo say 
Milosevic is deploying anti-aircraft missile batteries. Those batteries 
would likely be at the top of the NATO target list. But already, some 
members of Congress are questioning if this will turn into another 
operation like Bosnia with U.S. troops on the ground. Given the fact 
that we had such controversy about our role in Bosnia and such difficulty 
producing the funding necessary for it, I am reluctant to now recommend 
we have a significant presence of combat forces on the ground in Kosovo. 
The diplomatic process is still going on and officials are unwilling 
to say at what point it ends and air strikes begin. Carl Rochelle, 
CNN, the White House.
