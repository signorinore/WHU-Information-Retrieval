A full house vote on the possible impeachment inquiry against President 
Clinton is set for Thursday. The GOP controlled Judiciary committee 
voted to proceed Monday. Congressional sources say several house democrats 
are complaining about White House pressure to vote against the inquiry. 
A house representative says he believes the number of democrats staying 
true to a party plan that would limit the investigation is increasing.
