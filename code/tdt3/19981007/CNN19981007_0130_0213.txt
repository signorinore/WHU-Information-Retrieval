Lawyers for Paula Jones say the latest offer to settle her sexual 
harassment case against the president is not acceptable at this time. 
However, sources say the $700,000 offer has not been rejected outright. 
CNN has learned her lawyers have requested more time to consult with 
Jones and her husband. She accuses the president of exposing himself 
to her in a hotel room and of asking her for sexual favors in 1991 
when he was Arkansas governor. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, 
but Jones is appealing.
