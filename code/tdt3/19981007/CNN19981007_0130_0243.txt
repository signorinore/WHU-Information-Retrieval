The managing director of the international monetary fund says it probably 
is too dramatic yet to talk about global recession. But he says the 
evidence of the risks does call for immediate action. Treasury secretary 
Robert Rubin met with U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan Tuesday night. 
They discussed ways for the United Nations to help stabilize the global 
economy and talked about steps to prevent future economic disruptions. 
Earlier, President Clinton addressed the annual meeting of the IMF 
and world bank. He used his strongest language yet to describe the 
need for all countries to do their part to calm the global economic 
turmoil. Today, the world faces perhaps its most serious financial 
crisis in half a century. The gains of global economic exchange have 
been real and dramatic. But when tides of capital first flood emerging 
markets then suddenly withdraw, when bank failures and bankruptcies 
grip entire economies, when millions in Asia who have worked their 
way into the middle class suddenly are plunged into poverty, when 
nations, half a world apart, face the same crisis at the same time, 
it is time for decisive action. The treasury department has released 
a study showing the state-by-state impact global economic problems 
have had on American manufacturers and farmers. For example, U.S. 
chemical product exports to Asia are down 36% in Connecticut, 22% 
in Delaware and 35% in Florida. A loss of exports could translate 
into a loss of American jobs.
