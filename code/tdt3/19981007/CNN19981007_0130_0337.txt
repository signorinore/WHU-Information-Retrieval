John Glenn and the rest of his space shuttle crew arrived at cape 
Canaveral Tuesday for a countdown rehearsal. It's one of the final 
preparations before the space shuttle discovery blasts off on October 
29th. Among other things, in the next three weeks, the astronauts 
will practice emergency escapes from the launch pad. Glenn says he's 
feeling great. At 77, he'll be the oldest person ever in space by 
16 years.
