U.N. weapons inspectors are coming out against a proposal that would 
shift the Burden of proof in the Iraqi weapons search. U.N. secretary-general 
Kofi Annan suggests inspectors provide evidence the country is hiding 
deadly weapons and missiles. The inspectors say that would go against 
security council resolutions. Iraqi deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz 
says an environment of mutual suspicion is blocking an resolution 
to the standoff. One of the most disturbing aspects in this situation 
is the gap of trust between Iraq and UNSCOM. We worked with UNSCOM 
for over seven years and this gap of trust was actually widened, specially 
the last year since the last crisis, the beginning of the last crisis 
in September and October 1997. In a report to the security council, 
chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler says Iraq could be close 
to meeting the requirements for its missiles and chemical weapons. 
He says there is still a gap for possible biological arms.
