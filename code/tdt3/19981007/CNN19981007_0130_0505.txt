With a look at your "Headline News weather," I'm Karen McGinnis. A 
frontal system stretches from an area of low pressure across Hudson 
bay through the Great Lakes and into the gulf of Mexico. We'll expect 
some showers and storms to develop along this front. This is the same 
weather system that wreaked havoc through the central plains and produced 
flooding rainfall across Kansas, Nebraska and into Missouri. In the 
pacific northwest, here comes a frontal system that will keep temperatures 
a bit on the cool side, mostly 50s and 60s there. Also 50s and 60s 
from Quebec and Ontario into Minnesota and across into the Ohio valley 
into the northeast and New England. But 70s and 80s dominate across 
the southern third of the U.S. gusty trade winds for the Hawaiian 
islands, and afternoon showers are forecasted for the Caribbean. In 
the extended forecast for Thursday, 80s and 90s dominate the desert 
southwest. 50s and 60s are still wrapped around the Great Lakes region. 
It's going continue to be showery and windy for the pacific northwest.
