Hundreds of thousands of Russians are expected to participate in a 
day of nationwide strikes, rallies and marches Wednesday. They are 
protesting the economic crisis paralyzing the country. Overdue wages, 
soaring inflation and deteriorating living conditions are common complaints. 
Betsy Aaron looks at how Russia's economic and political turmoil is 
affecting one town. a man warms his hands over the eternal flame. 
It's cold in archangel -- in the whole of Russia's northern region 
-- cold inside homes, schools, factories. No heat, no hot water, very 
little fuel stored for the winter. The region has no money The ministries 
of finance and defense owe us 1 billion, 800 million rubles for our 
work. 40,000 died here during the world war II -- of starvation. And 
now a half century later -- I think that 90% of the people live below 
the poverty line. The formerly closed city of severodvinsk, 30 miles 
north, is a company town. The company builds nuclear submarines and 
a few fishing trawlers. The good news is that government orders for 
the shipyard, while they've dropped drastically, have not stopped. 
The bad news is that the government doesn't pay for what it orders. 
So the company and its town are sick. If a person gets sick you need 
to spoon feed him. You need to support him, you take care of him while 
he's sick. But nodbody's taking care of us right now. The mayor says 
good people, smart people, planned our future. But somehow it all 
went wrong. The president, he doesn't know of the situation and he 
doesn't know what is going here, just here. He speaks a lot about 
it -- he doesn't do anything. Here in the frigid and sometimes forbidding 
north, there is oil, there are diamonds, there is timber and there 
is patriotism. I love this country, I adore this country, I believe 
in our great future. "the powerful people in Moscow should come here," 
they say, "see what's worth saving and save it." "And save us." "Even 
better," they say, "maybe we should save ourselves." Betsy Aaron, 
CNN, in the archangel region of Russia.
