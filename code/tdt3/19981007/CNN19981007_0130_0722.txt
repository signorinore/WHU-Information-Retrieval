A very-much alive woman in West Virginia has a bone to pick with the 
federal government. Social security officials have declared Rosie 
Nelson dead three times in the past four months. Each time they've 
called her bank seeking the return of her benefit check. After the 
first time in June, Nelson showed up in person to prove she was alive. 
Eight days later it happened again.
