A lot of companies are seeing lower profits from a downturn in the 
economy. But Wal-Mart has announced an increase in sales and a plan 
to expand its overseas operations. Ceci Rodgers has that. At a time 
when economies are crumbling around the world, Wal-Mart is betting 
that people will still go for a bargain. The retailer is planning 
to open nearly 200 stores overseas and in the U.S. I think a down 
time in the economy is probably the best time for Wal-Mart to open 
stores. The down time, in the economy, means that a lot of people 
that in the past, for the most part, might have avoided discount stores 
are now switching to discount stores. In the U.S., Wal-Mart will open 
more than 100 stores and remodel nearly 100 others, most of them highly 
profitable supercenters. The company is stepping up its international 
expansion, in 1999 planning as many as 80 new stores in south America, 
Asia, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico. They really have only been in 
the international business for five years. But in that short period 
of time, Wal-Mart is now the largest retailer in Canada, they are 
the largest retailer in Mexico and their recent news will show expansion 
in south American, Asia and also into Europe. So, they really are 
becoming a force in a very short period of time internationally. Reflecting 
Wall Street's optimism that Wal-Mart can easily weather any downturn 
in the economy, its stock has held up throughout the Asia turmoil, 
down only 15% compared with 40% and more for many other retailers. 
And Wal-Mart is about to become even more pervasive. The company is 
rolling out neighborhood supermarkets in Arkansas this month. If they 
succeeds, analysts say Wal-Mart could grab a top spot in the grocery 
industry across the country. Ceci Rodgers, "CNN Financial News," Chicago.
