Mike Sammond, "Headline Sports." The Yankees have evened the score 
with jaret Wright. The Cleveland pitcher, who beat New York twice 
in last years playoffs, was rocked for five runs in the first inning 
Tuesday night as the Yankees beat the Indians 7-2 to claim the first 
game of the American league championship series. To see jaret go out 
in the first inning, I think was -- very, I don't know how to say 
it. I don't want to say that way -- gratifying. You know this game 
will come and bite you in the rear-end if you start, you know, start 
pounding your chest about certain things. You know, you've got to 
try to keep yourself under control. But as I say, when you knock a 
starter out in the first inning, yeah, that's a big thing for us. 
The national league championship series begins Wednesday night with 
the padres taking on the Braves. Andy Ashby will face John smoltz. 
Pressure is being in a situation you never been in before. That can 
be construed as pressure. And -- and I think for us, we've been in 
a lot of those situations. That's why people toward the -- kinda think 
we've got the edge. But, you know, it goes without saying, if you 
play good games and execute, then you don't have much pressure.
