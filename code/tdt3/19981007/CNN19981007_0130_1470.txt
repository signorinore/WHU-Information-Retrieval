The man who caught Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball says he's still 
thinking about what he'll do with it. For now, he's lending it to 
the St. Louis Cardinal's hall of fame . His attorney says he has received 
lots of offers, including one for $1 million. None of the offers has 
been from McGwire, who says he won't pay for any of his home run balls.
