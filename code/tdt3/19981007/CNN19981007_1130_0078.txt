President Clinton's news comes just in time for the release of the 
latest figures of college costs. The college board says the price 
of going to college rose an average of 4% this academic year. That's 
less than in previous years, but still more than double the rate of 
inflation. You can see a lot of students now calling financial offices 
now at schools and saying "X" school has offered me a little more 
money, I'm a higher-profile student, I'm the type of student that 
would round out your class. Do you want me? Will you give me more 
money? It's a very good option right now, people are doing it.
