More colleges are making the S.A.T. and A.C.T. optional. The national 
center for fair and open testing, or "fair test," says more than 280 
campuses admit some or all of their applicants without regard to those 
standardized tests. School officials say that means more minority 
students, more low-income students and more children of parents who 
have never attended college.
