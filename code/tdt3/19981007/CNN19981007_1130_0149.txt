Federal reserve chairman Alan Greenspan says the U.S. economy remains 
impressive. But he says it has become very fluid. And Greenspan says 
the outlook for 1999 has weakened immeasurably. In remarks to business 
economists today, Greenspan said the economy is still showing momentum. 
And although he noted financial markets are moving away from risk, 
Greenspan said loans have not dried up. Joining us now on the phone 
is Fred flick, vice president of economic research for the national 
association of realtors. Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. 
My blur. Mr. Greenspan mentioned that the housing market is one area 
that could be affected by the slide. Are the average homebiers expected 
to be affected by this? Are we talking about the average people who 
own a home? No, I seriously think the typical homebier is really basing 
that decision on family basis, demographics and whether they have 
a job in their kurnt income flow. I don't think that the actual fall 
in the value of their stock market portfolio is going to affect that 
adversely. He said that the market drop has caused consumers and businesses, 
I think, $1.5 trillion? You can't help but think you will eventually 
be affected by this. Well, I think they are big numbers and those 
are big changes in stock market. But remember, not everybody needs 
to tap their stock market account or their 401k or what have you, 
their pension plan accounts right now. And, really, a lot of your 
basis for buying a house is based on whether you have a job, and your 
cash flow and your family needs. And so I think for the typical Buyer, 
that it's not going to have that much of an adverse impact on the 
housing market. Right. And I guess all buyers like to hear the interest 
rates dropped a bit. Fred flick, thank you for joining us today. My 
pleasure. We'll get the latest figures from Wall Street in our "Dollars 
& Sense" segment at 46 past the hour.
