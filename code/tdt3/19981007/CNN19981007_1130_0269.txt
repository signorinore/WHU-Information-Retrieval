Congressional democrats are trying to find an alternative to the republican-written 
impeachment inquiry set for a vote tomorrow. That proposal calls for 
an open-ended inquiry, not necessarily limited to President Clinton 
and Monica Lewinsky. The entire house democratic membership met yesterday 
and will meet again this morning. The effort is to find a plan that 
will satisfy party liberals and conservatives, and not hurt members 
facing strong re-election challenges. Speaking to reporters this morning, 
the president seemed relaxed about the impending vote. I think the 
vote should be a vote of principle. It's up to others to decide what 
happens to me. And ultimately, it's going to be up to the American 
people to make it clear, a clear statement there. What I am more concerned 
about today, by far, is that they cast some votes necessary to advance 
the cause of our people. The most important votes they have to cast 
are the votes on funding the international monetary fund so we can 
continue our economic prosperity on a budget which doesn't rate social 
securitity, that rate the surplus until we fix social securitity. 
President Clinton made the comments during a photo op with Hungarian 
prime minister Victor orban.
