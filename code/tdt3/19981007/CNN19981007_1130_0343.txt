U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke has another meeting scheduled today with 
Yugoslavia's president, after failing earlier this week to persuade 
him to remove more troops from Kosovo. The talks come as NATO considers 
military strikes against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. One 
complicating factor is the Serb ownership of new surface-to-air missile 
equipment. "The London times" reports that Russians have supplied 
the Serbs with the advanced equipment, which could pose a serious 
threat to NATO troops. President Clinton says the threat of a NAto 
attack could be simply avoided if Milosevic lives up to past promises.
