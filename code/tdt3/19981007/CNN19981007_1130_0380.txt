Hundreds of thousands of frustrated Russians demonstrated in the streets 
of Moscow today. They protested against Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
and government policies which they blame for the country's deep economic 
crisis. Jill Dougherty joins us live from Moscow with more on this 
story. Jill? Catherine, it's dark here in Moscow and the protests 
actually officially are over. There is still some people left in the 
square behind me, near red square, near St. basil's Cathedral. But 
if turnout here was approximately 25,000 to 30,000 people in protests 
organized by unions and by the communist party. That fell short of 
what was expected, they were hoping for, some 150,000 to 300,000 people. 
Nationwide, it was pretty much the same picture. There were predictions 
that there could be up to 40 million people, but it fell far short 
of that. Estimates range from 2.5 million to as few as 700,000. The 
demands, however, regardless of how many people showed up, were essentially 
the same. People wanted payment of their back wages, and they also 
want President Boris Yeltsin to resign. Numerous calls for the president 
to resign. Mr. Yeltsin spent much of the day very close to where these 
demonstrators in Moscow were, in his office at the Kremlin. However, 
he made no official reaction or any public statement about the demonstrators. 
Many of them told us that they felt the turnout had not been as good 
because some actually have been paid back wages by the government. 
And they also feel that this new government of Yevgeny Primakov has 
some communists in it and it somehow muted the protests. Back to you, 
Catherine. Thank you, Jill Dougherty reporting live from Moscow. Thanks, 
Jill.
