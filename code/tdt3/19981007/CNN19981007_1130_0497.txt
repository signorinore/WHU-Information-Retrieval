I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "Headline News weather." It's 
going to be a cool day today over much of the northern midwest, only 
into the 50s for high temperatures. We will see some 90s in the southwest. 
80s will continue along the gulf coast. Your forecast from later today 
on into Thursday, notice the wet weather still along the front, which 
is going to push into the northeast by tomorrow, bringing with it 
some showers and storms there. And the gulf coast region will remain 
wet, too, with an area of low pressure forming along the front. High 
pressure, fair weather most of the west, the exception in the pacific 
northwest as the next frontal system pushes in there. Look at the 
extended forecast now for the weekend, showers and storms along the 
eastern seaboard during the day on Friday. And good chances for rain 
in the pacific northwest. Temperatures will begin to turn cooler through 
the northern Rockies as we head on into Saturday. Showers and storms 
remain in the forecast in the east during the day on Saturday. By 
Sunday, best chance for rain through the upper midwest, along with 
those cooler temperatures, which will be pushing in.
