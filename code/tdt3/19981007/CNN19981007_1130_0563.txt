Secretary of state Madeleine Albright today capped lengthy meetings 
with Israeli and Palestinian leaders with the announcement of a Washington 
summit next week. She said her meetings with prime minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu and Palestinian authority chairman Yasser Arafat had brought 
significant progress. She told reporters, the two sides are now in 
a position to resolve the differences which have blocked an agreement 
on the West Bank. My intention in coming here was to put together 
-- put in place some of the building blocks for the Washington summit. 
And to do everything I could to try to create a spirit of cooperation 
and to have the possibility of discussing all the relevant subjects 
that would be a part of the Washington summit. So, I didn't come here 
with any specific plan beyond wanting to put the building blocks into 
place. And I feel good about that. She said President Clinton will 
be very much involved in the details for the summit on October 15th.
