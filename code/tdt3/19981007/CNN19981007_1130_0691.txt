It starts with a deep cough and fever. Your chest hurts and you feel 
tired. There's a good chance you're coming down with acute bronchitis. 
It's an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, or airways, usually caused 
by bacteria or viruses. Bronchitis can last weeks, or even months, 
depending on your general state of health and how quickly you seek 
treatment. Bacterial bronchitis can be treated with antibiotics, viral 
bronchitis cannot. However, there are some prescription medicines 
available to help ease the symptoms. Doctors also recommend getting 
plenty of fluids and bed rest. To help prevent bronchitis, avoid exposure 
to smoke, wash your hands frequently and throw away used tissues. 
Left untreated, a bronchial infection can quickly turn into a life-threatening 
condition, like pneumonia. For the latest health news on line, check
