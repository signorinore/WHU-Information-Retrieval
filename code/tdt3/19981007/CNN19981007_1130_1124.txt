That's "Dollars & Sense." Catherine, back to you. Thank you, Valerie. 
Baseball playoff highlights are straight ahead in "Headline Sports." 
Boundaries. From the very beginning... we have resented them. So what 
happens? Some of us grow up to be business people. And what do we 
face? More boundaries. The telecommunications boundaries that separate 
local from long distance... voice from data... domestic from global. 
And force you to accept separate carriers separate networks, a blizzard 
of bills. Ah, but there is a way through those barriers. Right through 
here. The port of entry to a seamless global network that lets you 
have one carri one contt, O Bill. And majd it seem as though the old 
boundaries N longer exist. Because for you, they won't. On-net. From 
MCI Worldcom.
