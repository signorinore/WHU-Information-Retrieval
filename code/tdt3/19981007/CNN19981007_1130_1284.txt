Matt Yallof, "Headline Sports." Classic Yankees baseball in game one 
of the alcs. New York sent jaret Wright to the showers after scoring 
five first-inning runs. Lefty David Wells took it from there, getting 
some stellar defense in the process. Wells went eight and a third, 
allowing just two runs in the 7-2 win. If I was going to keep my fingers 
crossed, it was just let's get off the shnide real quick. But knoblauch 
and then jeter getting the base hits, this is what we've become used 
to seeing all year. I really wanted this. Because this is a situation 
where you win the first game, it -- you know, it can set a Tone. Game 
two this afternoon in the Bronx, David cone opposes Charles nagy. 
Cone is 12-2 this year at Yankee stadium. The nlcs opens tonight in 
Atlanta. Damp, mild conditions expected. The Braves sent John smoltz, 
the winningest pitcher in postseason history, to the hill. Andy Ashby 
opposes. The main thing for me is just control my emotions and my 
excitement to a point where I can go out and do my job and be effective.
