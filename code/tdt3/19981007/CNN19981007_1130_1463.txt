up just about all the unfinished plots and lose ends in the popular 
classic flick. The book is called "as time goes by," and is written 
by Michael Walsh. It also provides a history for Humphrey Bogart's 
character, Rick blaine. And if you're wondering what happens to the 
beautiful friendship between Rick and ilsa, they end up back together. 
At the end, Rick married to Isla, makes his trademark toast "here's 
looking at you kid".
