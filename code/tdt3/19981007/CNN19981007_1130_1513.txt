Designer Sonia rykiel says her latest collection is a celebration 
of women. Elsa Klensch takes us on the runway for a sophisticated 
glimpse of her work. Always an intellectual, designer Sonia rykiel 
celebrates 30 years in fashion with a show at the new, modern library 
in Paris. And rykiel doesn't disappoint. She does exaggerated cardigans, 
long skirts, full pants, curvaceous sweaters, colorful striped tops, 
and easy jackets. The place like that, the place needs something fantastic, 
something magic. The girls have to be magic, the clothes have to be 
magic, the music has to be magic. You can't use a place like that 
if you are not about to have a space like that. What gave you the 
idea to show in the library? Why not? I love words. I love books. 
Tell me, how has the 30 years of fashion designing influenced this 
collection? You know, I think my work is but it's an evolution, it's 
not a revolution. But it's true that now my purpose in fashion is 
to express what a woman of today, a woman of tomorrow can go, and 
can do in the world, in a political way, in a social way. Have you 
got very many patterns in the daytime? I have a lot of plaids. I have 
a lot of Scottish tartans. I love, I love. And also, flanle with stripes. 
And also a lot of Flowers in those fabric. What's evening like? Very 
sophisticated. Very, very sophisticated with a lot of lace, of muslin 
and printed muslin, very nice. Long dresses? Long dresses, and also 
jackets in velvet, printed with big pants in velvet also for evening. 
That's Sonia rykiel with her fall/winter collection. Elsa Klensch, 
CNN, Paris.
