Federal reserve chairman Alan Greenspan says the U.S. economy remains 
"an impressive sight," but he admits its outlook has "weakened immeasurably." 
In a speech to the national association of business economists, Greenspan 
acknowledged that people are having trouble borrowing money, but said 
there is no real evidence yet of a credit crunch. And he raised the 
prospect of more interest rate cuts to keep the U.S. economy on track. 
The economy has remained in reasonable shape with good growth and 
low, if not declining, inflation as a crucial element with respect 
to the existing state of affairs. But we are clearly facing a set 
of forces that should be dampening demand going forward to an unknown 
extent. We'll have more on Greenspan's remarks, and how they affected 
the stock market, in "Dollars & Sense" at 16 minutes past the hour.
