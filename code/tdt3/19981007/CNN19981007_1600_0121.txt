Large parts of the world are already in economic recession, or sliding 
toward something worse. So the question is, how much will the problems 
overseas affect us here at home? Terry Keenan takes a look. With more 
than one-quarter of the world's economies contracting, is the U.S. 
on a collision course with recession as well? After an eight-year 
expansion that defied expectations for both strength and longevity, 
it's a question that's commanding an increased sense of urgency from 
the White House to Wall Street. I think it's very highly likely that 
the U.S. economy will be stagnant by early next year. There's a possibility 
that we'll have a mild recession, and there is some possibility, when 
all the data is revised, we'll find out we may already be in a modest 
recession. That would surprise many economists, some at the federal 
reserve, who believe a recession rarely comes at a time of high employment 
and consumer confidence, not to mention the lowest inflation and interest 
rates in a generation. Indeed, you would have to look to 1953 or the 
roaring '20s to see the seeds of a boom-driven recession. But with 
a striking 55% of all U.S. household assets invested in the stock 
market, others contend the recent collapse in stock prices is red 
flag that cannot be ignored. For every $1 stock values decline, economists 
estimate consumer spending will drop by 4 cents -- enough alone to 
shave 1% off the GDP next year. The vulnerability of the economy to 
a stock market decline is greater than it's ever been. More households 
hold equities than ever before, and the personal savings rate is extraordinarily 
low. But while the ingredients may not be there for a classic recession 
in 1999, the troubling symptoms could prevail nonetheless. It's going 
to feel recession-like over the next 12 months in certain parts of 
the country. We don't have to have GDP going down two quarters or 
more to have a recession-like feeling. And it will feel that way, 
depending on what corporations do on jobs, I think they're going to 
be tough. The jobs market will be a lot worse. But while the stock 
market has predicted 80% of the recessions in the last 50 years, it 
has also forecast several that have never materialized. Including 
one after the last big stock market correction back in 1987. Terry 
Keenan, "CNN Financial News," New York.
