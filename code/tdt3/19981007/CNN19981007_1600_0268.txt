The justice department has filed an antitrust lawsuit against visa 
and Mastercard on charges they're limiting credit card competition. 
The government says together, visa and Mastercard account for 75% 
of all credit card purchases. It's challenging a rule that prevents 
banks that issue their cards from doing business with smaller companies 
like American express and discover. American consumers have simply 
lost out. They have lost the benefit of vigorous competition between 
the two largest credit card networks, which means that they have not 
enjoyed the innovation that competition brings. Visa says Americans 
have unlimited choices in credit cards, and is promising to fight 
the lawsuit in court. In a few moments we will talk with a consumer 
advocate about what the lawsuit could mean for you and your credit 
cards. .
