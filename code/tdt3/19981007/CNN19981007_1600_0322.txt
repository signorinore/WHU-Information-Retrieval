CNN has learned democrats want President Clinton to make a public 
statement giving them more leeway to vote for a republican resolution 
for an open-ended impeachment inquiry. The full house will vote on 
a formal inquiry tomorrow. Issue also came up during a meeting between 
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and democratic house freshmen today. 
Sources say Mrs. Clinton told the democrats the White House believes 
the republican impeachment proposal is unfair and part of a political 
strategy to hurt and embarrass the president. Most democrats want 
an alternative proposal that would satisfy liberal and conservative 
members, and those with tough re-election races. But they say they'll 
show solid party lines by voting along those lines. But President 
Clinton says the Americans will have the final say. I think the vote 
should be a vote of principle. It is up to others to decide what happens 
to me. Ultimately it is up to the American people to make a clear 
statement there. What I am more concerned about today, by far, is 
that they cast some votes necessary to advance the cause of our people. 
The most important votes they have to cast are the votes on funding 
the international monetary fund so we can continue our economic prosperity, 
on a budget that doesn't raid social security, raid the surplus until 
we fix social security. If there is an impeachment trial, it would 
be held in the Senate. Robert Byrd is warning the White House not 
to interfere with any decision. There's some people here who take 
their constitutional responsibilities very seriously. This will not 
be politics as usual, if articles of impeachment come to this body.
