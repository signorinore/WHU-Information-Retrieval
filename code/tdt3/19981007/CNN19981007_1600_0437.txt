Diplomats continued to work for peace in Kosovo as NAto prepared to 
take military action. U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke again tried 
to persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to try to comply 
with U.N. resolutions. Holbrooke is on his way to NATO headquarters 
in Belgium, where he'll brief top officials tomorrow. One official 
says NAto is prepared to launch military strikes in the next few days. 
President Clinton urged Yugoslavia to avoid a military confrontation. 
On Capitol Hill, there are calls for caution on all sides. It is imperative 
that prior to ordering any military strike on Serbia, you take all 
necessary steps to ensure both Congress and the American people that 
the action is necessary, affordable and designed to achieve clearly 
defined goals. A NATO air strike could run into improved Serbian air 
defenses. "The times" of London reports Russia has provided the Yugoslavian 
government with equipment to upgrade their surface-to-air missiles.
