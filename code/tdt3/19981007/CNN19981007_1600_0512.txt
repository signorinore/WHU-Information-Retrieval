This look at your "Headline News weather," and it begins with our 
weather map for Thursday evening. You can see an area of low pressure 
along a strong cold front that stretches through the east. It will 
be producing rainfall from the New England states, all the way down 
to the gulf coast, with the heaviest rainfall along the gulf coast, 
with even the threat of thunderstorms in that area. Now, as we put 
this map in motion, the cold front moves rather rapidly through the 
northeast, but quite slowly through the southeast. Again, this means 
more heavy rainfall in parts of the southeast. Behind the front, some 
cooler temperatures and generally dry weather, a couple of cold fronts 
are moving through the far west. You can see the 50s for highs in 
the northwest. 50s for highs in northern New England and the Great 
Lakes area, too. The plains states actually begin to warm a bit. We 
switch on over now and take a look at our extended forecast. On Friday, 
showers and thunderstorms linger along the eastern seaboard. And again, 
the rebounding temperatures expected across the plains states and 
parts of the midwest. This trend continues, as we head on into Saturday. 
And on Sunday, we're looking at moderating temperatures in the east. 
But cool weather again in the northern plains states. For more weather
