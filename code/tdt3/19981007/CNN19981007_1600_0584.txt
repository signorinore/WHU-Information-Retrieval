President Clinton and Congress are making it more affordable to get 
an education. Mr. Clinton signed legislation today reducing the interest 
rate on student loans. It is falling to the lowest level in 17 years, 
7.43%. grants to low-income students will rise to $5,800. More money 
for teacher training is also included in the Bill.
