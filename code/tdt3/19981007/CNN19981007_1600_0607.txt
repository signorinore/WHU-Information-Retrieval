As we reported earlier, the justice department is suing Mastercard 
and visa alleging they limit competition in the credit card market. 
Frank Torres joins us by phone to discuss the case. Thank you for 
being with us. Thank you. What's really at the rootd of this lawsuit 
as it relates to consumers? Well, I think it's all about competition 
here and whether or not these exclusive agreements that Mastercard 
and visa enter into with the banks limit competition in the marketplace 
by not allowing other banks to offer other credit card products. What 
about competition hurts a consumer? Well, when there's a lack of competition, 
the consumer loses. Stifling innovative products that might be coming 
out. Stifling costs of those products those types of things. Don't 
they already have a lot of options out there? Not really. When you 
take a look at the types of credit products that are being offered, 
it's actually a narrow range. Since there's -- with Mastercard and 
visa kind of controlling 75% of the cards that are being issued, and 
according to the defpt of justice, and statements made by Mastercard 
and visa, that there's little competition even between those two, 
by bringing in other companies to compete with them in terms of which 
cards the banks get to issue, we could see a greater number of different 
products, which would make it better for consumers and consumers getting 
better deals. All right. Thanks a lot, Frank Torres with the consumer 
union. Thanks a lot. Thank you.
