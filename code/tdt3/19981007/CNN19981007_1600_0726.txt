Welcome to another year of CNN's "cold and flu report." With the season 
of sniffles and sneezes starting up again, CNN will bring you a new 
report each week about colds, flu and the latest news on how to deal 
with them. October and November are the months to get your yearly 
flu vaccine. Typically, these vaccines consist of killed influenza 
viruses. And when you get injected with them, your body develops protective 
antibodies against influenza. Flu vaccines don't provide perfect protection, 
but they do greatly reduce the odds of catching the flu.
