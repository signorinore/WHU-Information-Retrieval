Wall Street finishes the day in the minus column. Kitty pilgrim has 
the closing numbers from the "CNN Financial News" news desk in New 
York. Kitty, what happened? It's a busy day today. The Dow Jones industrials 
went on a roller-coaster ride. The Dow moved higher early, and that's 
after news that Japan may be moving to solve its banking problems. 
The Dow moved 114 points higher, before turning down for the day. 
The broader markets were all lower.
