There was a warning from Alan Greenspan that economic growth here 
in the United States will slow. I think it sends a signal that we 
have some problems that will be hitting our shore, and we're starting 
to feel them. We had the highest trade deficit two months ago in August. 
We've got other signals that these problems are now starting to hit 
us. We had, if you look at today's paper, the largest layoffs. The 
layoffs last month were much bigger than the month before. Bond prices 
moved lower today as the dollar declined sharply in value.
