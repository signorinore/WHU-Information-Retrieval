Richard Branson, the head of virgin atlantic airways, may one day 
be riding the rails. Branson has expressed interest in running a high-speed 
rail system that would connect with virgin flights. That, according 
to an official with Florida's rail consortium. The consortium is already 
working with several European companies to develop a bullet-train 
system connecting Orlando to Miami and the Tampa bay area. If the 
system is up and running in the year 2006, as praned, it could link 
with virgin atlantic airways flights.
