Matt Yallof, "Headline Sports." It's postseason baseball like it used 
to be. Afternoon playoff game in the big apple. The Yankees and David 
cone facing Charles nagy and the Indians. New York with a 1-0 lead 
in the best of seven. Tonight in Atlanta, wet weather expected for 
the Braves/padres opener. Postseason stallion John smoltz gets the 
nod for the Braves. Andy Ashby on the hill for San Diego. As it's 
been through both leagues, pitching will be the key. I feel like opportunities 
are important. When you're facing pitching that's as difficult as 
it will be in this series, you have to capitalize on the opportunities 
you get. We were playing well in the last three weeks of the season. 
First three days in the playoffs we've done things to win ball games 
and put ourselfs in a pretty nice situation here. So we're pretty 
confident. The Rockies have not been to the postseason since 1995. 
But Jim leyland hopes to get them there soon by adding some big-named 
free agent the. Leyland was introduced today as the second manager 
in the Rockies' young history.
