This is Dennis Michael with the "Hollywood Minute." Christmas with 
the beach boys? An album of Christmas songs by the legendary California 
band has hit the record stores, but much of the album is over 20 years 
old. The group recorded seven Christmas tracks in 1977, but the masters 
were mislabeled and mislaid and they were just rediscovered this year. 
"Ultimate Christmas with the beach boys" is the name of the almost-new 
disc.
