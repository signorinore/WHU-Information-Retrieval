The classic ballet "swan lake" has been performed thousands of times 
over the years. So why does a new adaptation have the New York theater 
scene buzzing? Cynthia Tornquist takes a look. When it was first performed 
in London in 1995, Matthew Bourne's provocative restaging of the classic 
ballet was quickly dubbed "the gay 'swan lake.'" but Bourne's swans 
are not guys in Tutus, but feisty, Bare-chested men in feathery knickers. 
I felt that male dancers could show the two sides of the swan. Not 
just the beautiful gliding along the water swan that we all know from 
the ballet, I suppose, but, you know, the swan that can erupt into 
violence. I think it might be better if you started downstage, maybe. 
Adam Cooper, formerly of the royal ballet, dances the role of the 
swan opposite Scott Ambler's prince. When he actually said, "no, all 
of the swans are going to be male, and I want you to be the swan," 
it was a bit of a shock. What we decided to do was look back with 
kind of 20th century hindsight What we decided to do was look back 
with kind of 20th century hindsight into the psychology of the prince 
and try and work out why he falls in love with the swan. Because in 
the original story, it's all to do with magic and magic princesses 
turned by a magic owl into magic swans, and you think, "oh, get real." 
The result could have been disaster, but audiences and critics have 
praised the production, which is now selling out on Broadway. Bourne's 
production owes more to the theater than to classical ballet. I'm 
not a ballet choreographer, for one thing. I haven't got that background. 
And we call it dance theater and -- because it encompasses a lot of 
things, any form of dance, any form of mime, acting, whatever it is. 
Bourne has remained true to Tchaikovsky's score. More than knocking 
the ballet, I've hopefully given new life to the music. The production 
is likely to raise a few eyebrows -- but it shouldn't ruffle any feathers.
