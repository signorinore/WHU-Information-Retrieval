Don't expect a drop in credit card rates anytime soon. But in a round-about 
way, the justice department says a suit filed today against visa and 
Mastercard could eventually save all of us with credit cards some 
money. Tony Guida has that. Three out of every four credit card purchases 
in this country are charged either on a visa or Mastercard, making 
them kings of the credit card industry. But the justice department 
believes visa and Mastercard achieved that dominance by working together 
to limit competition. American consumers have simply lost out. They 
have lost the benefit of vigorous competition between the two largest 
credit card networks, which means that they have not enjoyed the innovation 
that competition brings. But a lawyer for Mastercard called those 
allegations astonishing. The justice department's claim is really, 
in a sentence, that there's not enough credit card choices available 
to consumers. There are 3 billion solicitations sent out a year. It's 
hard to imagine a more competitive industry than the credit card industry. 
But the lawsuit quotes a top Mastercard official as telling the justice 
department six years ago -- "Mastercard and visa simply do not compete 
in any conventional business sense." And justice argues this has resulted 
in a 10-year delay in the introduction of so-called "smart cards," 
as well as the development of a secure system of credit card transactions 
on the Internet. Hopefully, as a result of this action, consumers 
will be able to get a better deal. And that's what we're looking for 
in making sure that the marketplace doesn't become an exclusive playground. 
The case grows out of an extensive investigation following a complaint 
by American express nearly two years ago. It will take at least another 
year before the case is ready for trial. Tony Guida, "CNN Financial 
News," New York.
