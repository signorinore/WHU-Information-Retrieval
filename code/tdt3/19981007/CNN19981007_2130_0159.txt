Federal reserve chairman Alan Greenspan is putting Americans on notice 
-- the strong economy they've grown to know and love won't last forever. 
Speaking to a meeting of business economists, Greenspan said losses 
in the stock market, and the shaky global economy, are bound to slow 
growth. He predicted a decrease in personal spending and a slowdown 
in the real estate market. He hinted the fed may cut interest rates 
again. Greenspan emphasized the U.S. economy still is in reasonable 
shape. We are clearly facing a set of forces that should be dampening 
demand going forward to an unknown extent. In particular, a marked 
shift in investor psychology away from risk and toward liquidity and 
safety has exacerbated the problems in foreign markets, where deflationary 
forces remain virulent and has spread to the financial markets in 
the United States. We do not know how far it will go or how much it 
will affect consumer and business spending here at home. This is a 
time for monetary policy to be especially alert. Greenspan cautions 
that the financial markets cannot function efficiently under conditions 
of uncertainty and fear.
