The price of higher education is increasing at a lower rate than previous 
years, but college tuition still is going up faster than inflation. 
The college board reports the average increase is 4% this academic 
year for a typical four-year public institution. That raises tuition 
and fees $132 to $3,243. Even though they say there are a lot of students 
taking out loans, Congress lowered the interest rates on loans this 
year, so that money is at a better rate, and students can now save 
about $600 over ten years if you borrow about $12,000. So you can 
pull together a package, you can borrow money, you can look at regional 
schools. Lots of students go east or west, but the schools in the 
middle need to fill their seats.
