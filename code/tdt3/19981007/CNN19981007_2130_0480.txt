Sources tell CNN, congressional democrats want a public statement 
from President Clinton, giving them leeway to vote for an open-ended 
impeachment inquiry, which the republican majority in the house is 
preparing to approve tomorrow. Some house democrats from conservative 
districts or in close races have indicated they will vote with the 
republicans. Some have complained they feel pressured by the White 
House to vote against the resolution. President Clinton says house 
members should follow their consciences.
