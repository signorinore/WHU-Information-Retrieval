This look at your "Headline News weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for Thursday morning. You can see a strong cold front 
reaches from the northeast through the southeast. This frontal system 
moved all the way across the country carrying heavy rainfall with 
it. Bogs down a bit in the southeast. As you can see, the northern 
portion of the front should move through the northeast. But because 
of the slow movement through the southeast, we can see heavy rainfall 
particularly near the low pressure center. Now in the west a second 
cold front is moving in and one behind that rolls in through the northwestern 
corner of the United States with some rainfall associated with it. 
Take a look at your forecast for high temperatures. The cold front 
in the east will bring some chilly temperatures into the Great Lakes 
area and the cold front rolling through the west will bring cool temperatures 
into the great northwest. Take a look at extended forecast. Showers 
and thunderstorms Hang on in the east on Friday. In the plains states, 
temperatures tend to bounce back just a little bit after the cold 
front has moved through. Showers and thunderstorms Hang on in the 
east on Saturday. And as we head on into Sunday, cold weather slides 
in across the Canadian border. For more weather information, log on
