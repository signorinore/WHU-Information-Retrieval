NATO says the activation order for air strikes on Serb forces could 
come within the next few days. Pentagon sources tell CNN that 260 
U.S. warplanes would be made available in the event of a strike, forming 
the bulk of the attack force. NATO is demanding Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic end the crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. 
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke will meet with secretary of state Madeleine 
Albright tomorrow after three days of discussions with Milosevic failed 
to produce an agreement.
