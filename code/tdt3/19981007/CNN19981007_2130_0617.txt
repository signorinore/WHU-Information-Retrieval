The Marines are adding modern technology to a classic in military 
footwear. Charles Feldman reports in this edition of "tech trends." 
For decades, United States Marines have had to endure something far 
more painful, far more punishing, far more potentially damaging than 
boot camp. They've had to endure their boots. The old boot that we 
were using, which was made out of a hard rubber, transmitted the shock 
of the marching and drilling directly to the recruit's legs. But comfort 
wasn't the only problem with the old boots, they actually caused injuries. 
In recruit training, much of our attrition was due to lower extremity 
injuries such as stress fractures. And the boot problem was getting 
worse. Newer recruits grew up wearing mostly soft athletic shoes, 
or as with floridian Jason Collier, no shoes at all. It was definitely 
a shock -- it wasn't something I was used to. They would explain to 
us that people that had foot discomfort was because they weren't used 
to wearing hard-soled shoes. To the rescue -- technology. Or more 
to the point, high-tech, softer water-proof boots already commercially 
available. New Marine recruits, and soon all Marines, are now being 
outfitted with the more-stylish designer boot. Actually two different 
boots -- the matterhorn, made by cove, and another made by the belleville 
shoe manufacturing company. The new boots do cost more than the old 
ones, about $82 versus $55 a pair but -- The payback comes in a lot 
of different forms that you can either quantify or can't quantify 
in terms of cost, medical, moral, et cetera. And what about those 
who say a tough Marine shouldn't being wearing a soft boot. As a matter 
of fact, it's one thing to be hard, but it's another thing to be smart. 
I mean, you got to take care of your feet. If you want, you can buy 
the new Marine boots at your local shoe store. But they're a lot cheaper 
if you just join the Marines. Charles Feldman, CNN, camp pendleton,
