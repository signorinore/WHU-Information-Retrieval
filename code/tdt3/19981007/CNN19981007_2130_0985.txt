AT&T is hoping it and its customers will get lucky with its newest 
Venture. The telecommunications giant has started the "lucky dog" 
phone company, a new long distance service that lets people make less 
expensive calls by dialing extra digits. And one that offers customers 
prizes, like airline tickets and TVs. AT&T wants to compete with other 
dial-around services. It decided not to use its own name, though, 
for fear it would lose its existing customers.
