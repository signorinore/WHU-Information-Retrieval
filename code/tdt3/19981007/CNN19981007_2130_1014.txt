This is one of the most expensive years ever for business travelers. 
And that trend is expected to continue. Kalin Thomas-Samuel has details 
in this edition of "working ahead." Business travel costs could rise 
6% in 1999, according to the American express annual "trends and forecasts 
preview." American express predicts about a 5% increase in business 
airfares, as much as a 6% jump in corporate rental car rates, and 
about a 3% rise in restaurant meals, over this year's prices. And 
hotel rates could rise 10%. Strong demand for airline seats and hotel 
rooms are keeping prices high. American express says its forecast 
could change if global economic turmoil and a volatile stock market 
translate into lower demand for business travel. As airline ticket 
prices continue to rise, flying satisfaction is falling. The department 
of transportation says airline passenger complaints more than doubled 
over a one-year period. According to the monthly "air travel consumer 
report," fliers made more than 760 complaints against the top ten 
U.S. airlines in August, while they filed just under 370 complaints 
a year earlier. Northwest airlines had the most complaints, nearly 
190, while Alaska airlines passengers filed the fewest complaints, 
only six. The complaints include -- flight problems, overbooking, 
mishandled baggage, and bad customer service. It's a banner year for 
train travel. Amtrak reports more than two million passengers boarded 
the northeast corridor metroliner trains between last October and 
the end of September. It's the second record year for this alternative 
to flying. Our metroliner service now between New York and Washington 
is priced at about two-thirds the cost of an airline ticket. 15 metroliners 
make the three-hour daily run with stops in between. Kalin Thomas-Samuel, 
CNN, reporting.
