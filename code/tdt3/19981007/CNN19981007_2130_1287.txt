The Yankees out to make it two straight. I'm Anthony Keith James and 
this is "Headline Sports." The Yankees looked to 20-game winner David 
cone to lead in the American league championship serieses this afternoon. 
He'll get the start against naggy. Ashbee will start against John 
smoltz tonight. The Braves will call on John smoltz who beat the padres 
twice during the regular season.
