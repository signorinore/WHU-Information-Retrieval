The Colorado Rockies introduced their new manager today, jiem leyland 
becomes the second manager in the team's six-year history. He replaces 
Don Baylor who has been moved to a front office job. We think we got 
a chance to get it done. I don't know how soon. I'm not going to make 
any ridiculous statements today. All I can tell you is that we have 
a nucleus. When you talk about young players like Neifi Perez. I really 
believe sin serly that it is not far away. Art Howe will stay. Howe's 
new contract is expected to be announced. His return was in question 
after the club won just 74 game hs the past season.
