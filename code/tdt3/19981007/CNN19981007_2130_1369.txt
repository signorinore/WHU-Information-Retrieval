To Thailand, where first they dress them up, then they hop on their 
backs -- I wouldn't call Charlie's parents overprotective, but maybe 
Charlie would. If one pad is good... two pads are even better. Ouch! 
His parents just want to make sure he's on the go safely. Don't forget 
to buckle up! So it figures they'd get a Ford Taurus. Does he have 
enough pads on? The only sedan starting under $20,000 to earn a five 
star government front crash test rating. Be careful! I wouldn't say 
they're oveprotective... other way! Other way! They're just parents. 
Ford Taurus...
