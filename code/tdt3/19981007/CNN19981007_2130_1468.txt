You don't need a museum to enjoy Salvador Dali's work. Here's a virtual 
exhibit in this edition of "online." Salvador Dali once said "I am 
surrealism." And this web site, devoted to the Spanish surrealist 
painter, proves he was right. The Salvador Dali art gallery, at the 
address shown below, provides an online Dali primer that could appeal 
to fanatic art lovers and casual art likers. There's a gallery full 
Dali's paintings which are grouped chronologically to help you trace 
the evolution of an artistic genius. If there is a particular painting 
that persists in your memory, find it in the gallery search. Essays 
detailed Dali's life and the different phases he and his work went 
through. Of course, you can skip all the academic stuff. It's the 
painting themselves and the nearly 60 years of great art they represent 
that make this site a visually pleasing stop on your web-surfing session. 
CNN.com/online has links to this and other sights. And that's what's 
"on-line."
