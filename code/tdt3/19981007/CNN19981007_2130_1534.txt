Designer Sonia rykiel says her latest collection is a celebration 
of women. Elsa Klensch takes us on the runway for a sophisticated 
glimpse of her work. Always an intellectual, designer Sonia rykiel 
celebrates 30 years in fashion with a show at the new modern library 
in Paris. And rykiel doesn't disappoint. She does exaggerated cardigans, 
long skirts, full pants, striped tops and easy jackets. In a place 
like that, the place needs something fantastic, something magic. The 
girls have to be magic, the clothes have to be magic, the "Des fils" 
has to be magic, the music has to be magic. You can use a place like 
that if you are not able to do clothes in a space like that. What 
gave you the idea to show in the library? Why not? I love words. I 
love books. Tell me, how has the 30 years of fashion designing influenced 
this collection? You know, I think my work is -- it's an evolution, 
it's not a revolution. But it's true that now my purpose in fashion 
is to express what a woman of today, what a woman of tomorrow can 
go, and can do in the world, in a political way, in a social way. 
Have you got many patterns in the daytime? I have a lot of plaids. 
I have a lot of skirt -- Scottish tartans, yes, Jersey practical -- 
I love, I love. And also, flannel with stripes. And also a lot of 
Flowers in those fabric. What's the evening like? Very sophisticated. 
Very, very sophisticated, with a lot of lace of muslin and printed 
muslin. Long dresses? Long dresses, and also jackets in velvet, printed 
with big pants in velvet, also for evening. That's Sonia rykiel with 
her fall/winter collection. Elsa Klensch, CNN, Paris.
