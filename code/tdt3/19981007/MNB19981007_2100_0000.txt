The eve of the vote and the effort by the first family to sway the 
hearts and minds of fellow democrats even while the president is headed 
for almost certain defeat in the house. What the man in charge had 
to say today -- how bad is the economy in the U.S. and around the 
world? The predictions, the prognosis and what if anything Americans 
can do to prepare before the downturn turns nasty. And from "dateline 
NBC," part two of the look at the widowed first lady and the second 
chance late in life.
