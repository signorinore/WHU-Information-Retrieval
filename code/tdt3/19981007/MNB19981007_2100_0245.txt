So Ken Starr has been located. And moving on to Congress, even if 
they are getting lobbied or squeezed or even just persuaded bust a 
bit -- just a bit by the president or his surrogates, some house democrats 
are well aware that if they vote with this president on this case, 
they have to sell and explain that vote back home. With more on the 
view from the hill, here now NBC's Gwen Ifill. For dozens of congressional 
democrats, cloolclool -- Capitol Hill turned into a pressure cooker 
today. One, Brad Sherman, from California, who may cast the most important 
vote of his political career tomorrow. And in less than a month, he 
faces the voters. I don't want people voting for or against me as 
a ourgate vote on what they think should happen to the president. 
But Sherman may not have much choice. The people most likely to vote, 
he says, are the ones who don't trust Bill Clinton. Clinton has lost 
a lot of respect. People are really concerned about our government. 
While voters say they really want the scandal to go away aren't likely 
to vote at you A. I used to think that it would have a slightly Negative 
effect. And right now I see an unpredictable effect. Facing a well-financed 
republican opponent, Sherman shares this dilemma with dozens of other 
vulnerable democrats many are calculating to the last possible moment 
the political cost of being linked to a disgraced president. With 
election day only 26 days away, the president's defenders concede 
they will lose tomorrow. To contain the damage, democratic leaders 
plan to ask Congress to wrap up the impeachment debate by the end 
of the year, but party leaders concede tonight that even that compromise 
may not change enough minds to spare the President a historic and 
painfully embarrassing vote tomorrow. Gwen Ifill, NBC news, the capitol.
