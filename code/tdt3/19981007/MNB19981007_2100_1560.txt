John Glenn made history three decades ago in his Mercury capsule. 
Friendship 7 it was called. First American to orbit the earth. Now 
at the age be 77 and in better shape than most Americans, he'll go 
into space again in October on the space shuttle discovery. As a lot 
has changed, of course, since John Glenn's younger days. The space 
craft is computerized and is should be a whole lot safer. Countdown 
to an American hero making history again. Today, senator John Glenn 
and his fellow crew members, learning to drive a fireproof armored 
vehicle that would be used to escape the launch pad in an emergency. 
For Glenn and six other astronauts, some less than half his age, a 
day of instruction, intensity, and great anticipation. It's a great 
project, I'm proud to be into it and I want to bring back good information 
that makes it well whorthwile. It was the 1962 when John Glenn blasted 
off to become the first American to orbit earth. A risky mission in 
experimental rocket Mercury 7. today the former Marine fighter pilot 
is slower, less agile. He laughs, but knows anything can happen, like 
the challenger disaster in 1986. At the time, NASA said chances of 
a catastrophe were 1 in 75. But with improvements, NASA estimates 
there is a 1 in 438 chance of a shuttle disaster. Glenn and fellow 
crew members devote much of their preparation to safety and he clearly 
holds his own. For this flight alone, NASA spends $275,000 training 
each of the astronauts. Glenn ghits much of the new shuttle state 
of the art technology is beyond his grandson. I'm just glad to be 
going up again. I don't really think about that. Instead, he's focused 
on another shot at making history by helping teach people more about 
the aging process. It's not important how I feel standing here. The 
important thing is the opportunity that this gives to take us in some 
new directions with with research. Glenn will help show whether older 
people endure a trip to space and recover the same way younger people 
do. Tomorrow, Glenn and the others will begin a full dress rehearsal, 
a mock 24-hour countdown to liftoff three weeks before launching into 
space on discovery.
