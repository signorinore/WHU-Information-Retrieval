Others were less optimistic but Greenspan left little doubt when it 
came to how he feels about the threat posed by economic turmoil in 
Asia, Russia, and elsewhere throughout the world. Last week, as you 
may know, the fed dropped the big short-term interest rate. Much speculation 
tonight that a second drop, even a small one, may be imminent. Wall 
Street took the news pretty well. The Dow Jones industrials shot up 
immediately after his speech but lost that ground. 7741 the final, 
volume very heavy. NASDAQ hit its lowest point of the year today.
