This recent volatility of the stock market, up and down, has a lot 
of investors concerned about their financial futures. A lot of people 
are wondering just where they should be putting their money. That 
is the big question, and especially money they were saving for retirement 
someday. Here to help sort through all this is "money" magazine editor 
at large and MSNBC money editor Jean chatzky. Hi, Brian. What is going 
on right now volatility rise? Seems to be no rhyme or reason to it. 
It seems that way. I'm hard-pressed to remember a day in the last 
couple months where we haven't had swings of more than 100 points. 
We all have to brace our selves a bifment You and other experts can't 
just answer the blanket question, where should people put their money 
because there are various needs in varies age groups. First up to 
remember your short-temple money just doesn't belong in the market. 
You better pull it out right about now, the money you need in the 
next one to three to five years. When it comes to your long-term funs 
funds, the percentage you want to have in the market is directly relative 
to how long you have to put it there. People in 20's and 30's can 
put 70% to 80% of their assets still in stocks. The rest split between 
bonds and cash. And as you get older, 40's and 50's, the percentage 
drops to 50% or 60% in stocks, the rest split between bonds and cash. 
Finally moving into your 60's and 70's, the percentage in stocks, 
the riskiest investments, drops back even further. Even people in 
their 80's these days can't afford not to have some exposure ure to 
the market. People are living much longer. People are looking for 
other safe havens, bonds, comfortable mutual funds so a lot of people 
will be the beneficiaries of this outflow from the market. August, 
for the first time we saw money coming out of stock mufedse exceed 
that going in for the first time in eight years. Again, it was a significant 
move. It gave us some sense that people are indeed very fearful but 
they should be look at C.D.'s, money market accounts, treasuries and 
other places where they can feel a little bit more able to sleep at 
night. What was the story people might have heard about the U.S. government 
and visa and Mastercard? The justice department has actually brought 
an antitrust suit against the visa and Mastercard associations on 
two counts. It's alleging that visa and Mastercard are not competitive 
enough with each other because the same, largely same group of banks 
tends to run both associationes and it also contends that the banks 
that issue vice visa and Mastercard are not allowed tooo issue other 
cards like Mastercard and discover. Jean chatzky, thank you.
