When we come back, You remember-- that foul ball. Yeah. You were 12, 
a hotdog in each hand. I reached up and snatched that ball right out 
of the sky. Well, this time the hotdogs are on me. I wish I could. 
Oh, but, dad, you can. Take this pepcid ac before you eat, heartburn

hotdogs, and I'll get us another foul ball.
