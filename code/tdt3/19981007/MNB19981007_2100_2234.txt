The latest on the hot spots -- saber-rattling all around today as 
it looks increasingly like time might be running out for a peaceful 
resolution to the crisis between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in the 
former Yugoslavia. U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke met again today with 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic but he refused again to withdraw

order, fancy word for getting military hardware in place for an attack 
of some sort.
