And meanwhile, on another front, there what's been at least reported 
progress in the Middle East peace talks today. Secretary of state 
Madeleine Albright met with Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat on 
the border between Israel and Gaza. The first time, by the way, that 
a modern 46 day Israeli prime minister has gone into that region for 
peace talks. Madeleine Albright was optimistic as the date for the 
final meeting in Washington with President Clinton has been set now, 
October 15. Netanyahu was much more cautious in his assessment.
