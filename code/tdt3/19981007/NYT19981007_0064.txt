Though it dedicates itself to avoiding directorial egotism, in accordance 
with strict rules of the Danish filmmakers' collective known as Dogma 
95, Thomas Vinterberg's ``Celebration'' is still a virtuoso feat. 
Five years out of film school and colossally assured, Vinterberg strips 
away the conventions of ordinary filmmaking (as per the group's manifesto) 
and furiously devises new, unfettered ways of telling a story. If 
the style of this group, which also includes the formidable trend-setter 
Lars von Trier, should ever become widely imitated, it risks looking 
as fresh as the Macarena. But at a time when filmmaking so often falls 
back on the familiar, its effect indeed manages to be excitingly inventive 
and pure. Dogma 95, in brief: Look, Ma, no genre stories or superficial 
action. No special lighting or extra sound. No tarting up the location 
with props; no optical tricks; no camera work that isn't hand-held. 
No black-and-white or flashbacks. And for the director, goodbye to 
an actual credit and so-called personal imprint. ``My supreme goal 
is to force the truth out of my characters and settings,'' say the 
group's Vows of Chastity. ``I swear to do so by all the means available 
and at the cost of any good taste and any esthetic considerations.'' 
If this sounds like a stunt, it surely doesn't look that way in ``The 
Celebration.'' Choosing as his setting a grand chateau that is a family-owned 
hotel, Vinterberg presents a birthday reunion that becomes a black-tie 
psyche-bashing blowout with latter-day Shakespearean overtones. The 
king of this event is Helge (Henning Moritzen), a prosperous patriarch 
turning 60 and presiding over longtime friends and rebellious children. 
The event begins with an excess of gentility (``Thanks for a lovely 
funeral,'' ``Thank YOU!'') and whirls into battle royal once an army 
of skeletons comes out of this family's closet. While the strictures 
on the film's direction may sound like the visual equivalent of a 
brown rice diet, Vinterberg instead shows off thrilling vitality. 
Taking full advantage of the lack of restrictions on film editing, 
he hurtles the film forward in a manner that feels seamless but calls 
for immense skill. With terrific agility, he keeps the camera work 
vigorously mobile (the film was shot with a small video camera, then 
transferred to Dogma-ordained 35-millimeter format) and jump cuts 
with nimble grace. And all the ostensible limitations of this approach 
are transformed into opportunities. Unusual vantage points, close 
scrutiny of faces and savvy editing juxtapositions create the story's 
palpable momentum. The confused hush at dinner after one shocking 
pronouncement creates much sharper emphasis than any garden-variety 
music cue would. ``It is quite a job being toastmaster tonight,'' 
remarks one guest, illustrating the power of understatement as a tactic 
here, too. Helge's son Christian (Ulrich Thomsen) arrives at the party 
with the self-appointed mission of making his father own up to past 
sins. As the full house of guests settle in _ including Michael (Thomas 
Bo Larsen), Christian's black-sheep brother, and their loose-cannon 
sister, Helene (Paprika Steen) _ Christian prepares to tap his knife 
against his glass and make a terrible pronouncement. He plans to tell 
the assembled revelers about having been incestuously abused by Helge 
and that the death of Christian's twin sister, Linda, is on Helge's 
hands. But like the audience, Christian is in for some surprises. 
This crowd looks civilized, but it proves amazingly shockproof, too. 
``The Celebration,'' which easily accommodates allusions to both ``Cries 
and Whispers'' and ``The Godfather,'' features a large, credible cast 
all over the hotel, from patrician guests to flirtatious waitresses 
to Helene's American boyfriend (a black man whose presence brings 
out the considerable worst in this family) to a kitchen staff bent 
on settling old scores. They and Vinterberg (who wrote the screenplay 
with Mogens Rukov) succeed dizzyingly well in making this a party 
to remember. PRODUCTION NOTES THE CELEBRATION Directed by Thomas Vinterberg;
