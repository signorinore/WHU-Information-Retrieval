``Were you always a peasant?'' one handsome young man asks another 
in the Austrian film ``The Inheritors,'' prompting the suspicion that 
a strain of tongue-in-cheek mischief may be alive and well here. In 
the midst of Stefan Ruzowitzky's somber rural allegory, which owes 
much of its visual inspiration to the palette and compositional sense 
of the Dutch masters, that would indeed be a ray of light. Ruzowitzky's 
film, part of the New York Film Festival, does show off a knowingness 
that reaches beyond its stylized simplicity, but its tone often remains 
uncertain. What starts out as an arrestingly sharp film with strong 
political undercurrents winds up increasingly unfocused as it goes 
along. Set in a Austrian village in the 1930s, but often looking so 
classically rustic that it could date back a century or two earlier, 
``The Inheritors'' revolves around the death of a landowner and his 
unexpected bequest. He leaves his farm to be divided up among seven 
workers who have humbly labored there, and there are predictably fractious 
consequences. Meanwhile, as the peasants try to create a new order 
(a process as much expressed through wordless slurping of soup as 
through resonant dialogue), a mystery hovers. A silent old woman named 
Rosalind (Elizabeth Orth) has appeared in the dead man's chicken coop. 
Naturally, there is much curiosity over what that signifies. Less 
than it should, ultimately. ``The Inheritors'' works better at defining 
its specific characters than at making them part of an interesting 
scheme. Among those who stand out are Sophie Rois as Emmy, the group's 
firebrand, and Simon Schwarz as Lukas, the former foundling who becomes 
an object of fascination all around the barnyard. ``Now everything 
is so complicated!'' Lukas complains midway through the story, when 
the landowner's legacy has begun to bear bitter fruit. Not complicated 
enough. PRODUCTION NOTES THE INHERITORS Directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky;
