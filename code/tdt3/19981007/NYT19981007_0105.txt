Cynics will wonder why, if Susan Miller can really peek into the future, 
she did not predict years ago that something called the Internet would 
make her fortunes rise as an astrologer. But then, Ms. Miller _ whose 
Astrology Zone is one of the most popular of its kind on the Web, 
spawning a number of media spinoffs _ is accustomed to wisecracks 
from those who doubt that the stars and planets guide personal fates. 
``Some people see astrology as fortune telling,'' she said. ``It's 
not. It's the study of cycles.'' Ms. Miller, who is in her mid-40s 
(she won't be more specific) learned astrology from her mother as 
a girl. And she did have some early clues about where the cycles might 
take her _ and that technology would play a role. ``My Aquarius was 
in Uranus,'' she explains. (There's more to an astrological reading 
than the sun sign that even most nonbelievers can identify.) ``I have 
Gemini rising, which means publishing, and I'm a Pisces, which is 
philosophical. My moon is in Virgo, which explains my voluminous manuscripts.'' 
But dotted throughout her chart was the planet of things technological: 
Uranus. ``As I got on with my life, I knew something newly invented 
would figure prominently in my career,'' Ms. Miller said. Which is 
why, when Time Warner Electronic Publishing asked her in 1995 to create 
an astrology Web site, ``I knew this would fulfill the potential of 
my life.'' What Ms. Miller did not know at the time was exactly what 
that meant. She was already a personal computer devotee, having discovered 
that software was a great aid in the complicated mathematics involved 
in the ancient science of astrology _ which calculates the placement 
of the planets at the precise time and location on Earth of a person's 
birth, and continues that calculus over the course of the person's 
life. But in 1995, the Web was new enough a medium that it would have 
been hard for anyone to predict that with no publicity and a difficult-to-find 
on-line address (www.pathfinder.com/twep/astrology) that Astrology 
Zone would become so popular that it would prompt a flurry of other 
media deals: television commentaries on shows like Fox's ``Good Morning 
New York''; a two-book contract with Warner Books, with the first 
to be published in 1999; columns in magazines like McCall's, New Woman 
Australia and Self; and a 900-number telephone service. Although neither 
of the leading Web-metering services, Media Metrix or Relevant Knowledge, 
has comparative figures on astrology sites, Ms. Miller said that her 
site attracted more than 1.3 million page views a month and had generated 
a mailing list of at least 33,000 readers. Those readers log on for 
a detailed commentary of the movement of the planets and an analysis 
of what that means for each of the twelve signs of the zodiac _ as 
well as the world at large. Well before the release of the Starr report, 
Ms. Miller wrote about three eclipses coming in rapid succession _ 
an Aug. 7 lunar, an Aug. 21 solar and a Sept. 6 lunar _ and discussed 
their potential power: ``Close to eclipses, the media always bring 
news of world events that stir us, no matter which side of the issue 
we happen to be on. With any eclipse, the level of emotion is heightened, 
and it is hard to think straight. No matter what comes up, don't rush 
to judgment based on what you think is obvious. Eclipses push so much 
information at us that it is hard to make sense of it all at once. 
Sit back, think, read, reflect, talk, and think some more.'' Another 
popular feature on the site is a match-making guide, where readers 
can determine whether a love interest is astrologically appropriate 
and figure out suitable gifts and courting techniques according to 
sign. ``If you take your Scorpio beloved out for dinner,'' she suggested 
to men trying to woo a woman born under that sign, ``make it a private 
little dark rendezvous, overlooking water if possible or, better yet, 
as a guest on a private yacht (preferably yours).'' Ms. Miller _ who 
juggles her astrology ventures with the photographers' agency Susan 
Miller Represents, which she runs with her business partner, Evelyn 
Brady _ said she was no longer surprised by the variety of people 
who were interested in her line of work. ``I thought the creative 
ones would be the only ones interested in astrology,'' she said. ``I 
was afraid to tell techno-heads that I was into this. But they were 
into it. Mathematicians, scientists, people dealing in biology, were 
very intrigued as well.'' The Web, Ms. Miller conjectured, allows 
people who might not otherwise admit an interest in horoscopes to 
check out the stars in relative privacy. That tendency has made astrology 
popular elsewhere on the Internet, as well. America Online helped 
start Astro Net, based in New Canaan, Conn., in 1995. Its creators 
say that 300,000 people read its horoscopes each day, and America 
Online officials confirm that Astro Net has become one of the online 
service's most popular features. ``From a business standpoint, there 
are a lot of people who `don't believe in astrology,' but a lot of 
people who read their horoscopes,'' said Eugenie Diserio, president 
of Astro Net. Purveying broad advice, rather than predicting specific 
incidents, is what Ms. Miller sees as the role of astrology. But it 
was one such case, in late 1994, that sent her into the business from 
her original career as an agent for commercial photographers. ``I 
was selling photographs to Warner Books because they needed cover 
art, and portraits,'' Ms. Miller said in explaining her accidental 
foray into the business of calculating charts. To the creative director, 
Jackie Meyer, she confided her astrology skills, and thanked her for 
the business by reading her charts over lunch. ``I told her I would 
like her to buy a lottery ticket the last two weeks of December,'' 
Ms. Miller said. ``She said, `I never win,' and I said, `Just buy 
something.' '' According to Ms. Miller, Ms. Meyer forgot that she 
had already purchased a raffle ticket in the office, which resulted 
in a telephone call on New Year's Eve telling her she had just won 
a Porsche. ``She called and said, `I have 30 editors outside my door 
who want to meet you,' '' remembered Ms. Miller, who credits that 
bit of soothsaying as the incident that pushed her out of the astrological 
closet. Ms. Meyer ultimately offered her a book contract, and offered 
her up as a candidate for the site she now runs. Ms. Miller, who earned 
a degree in business from New York University, is pragmatic about 
her calling. ``People think things are fated,'' Ms. Miller said. ``I 
am dealing with probability. When you are in a good cycle, your probability 
statistics are high. When things are going against you, I don't want 
you taking big risks. When you're in a tough cycle, there's always 
somewhere in your chart that's good.'' NYT-10-04-98 1659EDT
