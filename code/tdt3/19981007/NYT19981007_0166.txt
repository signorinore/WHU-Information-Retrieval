For years Josh Gabriel, a musician and computer programmer, had looked 
for a way to make composing and recording music as simple for the 
average person as desktop publishing had made producing newsletters 
and brochures. Traditionally, anyone wanting to make music had to 
learn to play an instrument or be lucky enough to have a pleasing 
singing voice. And even becoming an entertaining rapper required talent 
and practice and a DJ, someone who mixed music on increasingly expensive 
and complicated equipment. ``I just wanted to let people actually 
get their own hands on music,'' said Gabriel. Four years ago he helped 
to form Mixman Technologies in San Francisco and began the work of 
building just such an enabling technology. What he came up with and 
delivered to retail shelves last Christmas was Mixman Studio. It is 
a software package that creates on a personal computer a self-contained 
recording studio and a real-time mixer. The mixer, which is the heart 
of the application, has undergone two refinements. The latest version, 
which includes a sound-effects studio and editing capacity, is scheduled 
to go on sale next month. All of the mixers resemble a three-dimensional 
view of a hip-hop DJ's dual turntables. Any wav file, the common means 
of digitally storing sound in PCs, can be loaded into Mixman. Gabriel's 
company also sells enhanced music CDs that are packed with hundreds 
of prerecorded samples, or clips, of music. The clips can be taken 
from the CDs once they are placed in a CD-ROM drive much the way clip 
art is copied from CD-ROMs. Gabriel, who is vice president and creative 
director of Mixman Technologies, added that his company buys the rights 
to the musical samples, some from well-known artists like George Clinton 
and Naughty By Nature. That makes the sound clips royalty-free to 
constomers. Once these clips _ actually short loops of musical phrases, 
such as bass lines, synthesizer cords, vocal tracks, percussion, guitar 
licks and sound effects _ are placed with a mouse click into Mixman 
they become represented on the mixer by a letter or number. Hold down 
the `I' key, for instance, and as long as it is depressed the sound 
of a drum playing is heard. Each of the 16 keys call up musical sounds, 
each synchronized to play together in key and tempo. The samples can 
be layered in or out as the user wishes. ``We wanted to sort of open 
the door for the average person into the thought processes behind 
making music,'' said Gabriel. ``People want more customization. This 
is customization of music down to the molecular level.'' But Mixman, 
which is scheduled to appear also in a Mac version in December, has 
its limitations. Creating music with complex harmonic structures is 
practically impossible. Gabriel acknowledged that Mixman is best suited 
for creating highly rhythmic music that tends to depend heavily on 
repetitious elements, like hip-hop, house and raggae music often do. 
While some musicians have rejected the idea of inviting listeners 
to remix their finished work, others, said Gabriel, have welcomed 
it. ``They understand that there is something to having a fan appreciate 
in a deeper way what the artist is doing by letting them into the 
work,'' he said. A limited version of Mixman Studio can be downloaded 
free at www.mixman.com. The retail version costs $49.95; the deluxe 
model, Mixman Studio Pro, with sound effects and editing additions, 
is scheduled to be in stores in November for around $119, said Gabriel 
who plays his Mixman as if it were a musical instrument. ``The idea,'' 
he said while he mixed tracks without looking at his computer keyboard, 
'' is to bring music, interactive music, to the masses.''
