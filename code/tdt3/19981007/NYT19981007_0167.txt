There is virtual. And then there is fake. The Tonka Workshop is fake. 
Specifically, it is a plastic play set that straps onto a keyboard 
so children 3 and older can use ``tools'' when prompted by a CD-ROM 
character named Tonka Joe. ``Using the (italics)actual(end italics) 
plastic hammer, spray-paint can or screwdriver,'' the press release 
explains, ``kids control virtual tools in a world full of building 
and exploring on the computer screen. The unique play set lets kids 
work on several projects, from robots to toy houses and spaceships. 
They'll sharpen their tool skills at the Tool Olympics and use their 
tools to discover the mysteries of the Junk Shop. Once they've earned 
their Master Tool license, they're ready to hop in the Tonka Workshop 
van and head out to virtual, on-site fix-it missions.'' Let's talk 
about tools for a second. A tool is a way of channeling energy to 
shape or change an object, be it real or virtual. A hammer is a tool. 
Scissors are a tool. A word processor is a tool. Hypertext markup 
language is a tool. There are tools that work in a virtual environment, 
but there is no such thing as a virtual tool. A plastic drill that 
depresses the Caps Lock key is not a tool. It isn't virtual. It's 
fake. Of course, we've been giving fake tools to children for years. 
Plastic hammers for boys, plastic ovens for girls. But we have never 
given them the idea that fake tools could accomplish real tasks. And 
that is the underlying assumption of this toy. You select a project 
from the on-screen Drawing Board, where all the projects have been 
conveniently drawn for you. In this universe, construction requires 
no planning, and you're not allowed to design anything yourself. Then 
Tonka Joe says, in a voice eerily reminiscent of Phil Hartman's, ``Since 
you're so good with tools, you do the building while I read the instructions.'' 
``Cut out the pieces for the sled with your saw.'' So you jerk the 
plastic saw back and forth. The Close Bracket key goes up and down 
a few times. ``Now use your socket wrench to bolt the runners to your 
sled.'' ``A coat of paint from your sprayer, and your sled will be 
ready for the hill!'' Three keystrokes later, voila, a purple sled. 
``Nice work!'' The problem is, the sled isn't ready for the hill. 
It isn't even ready for a digital hill. It's ready to be printed out. 
But that's all. And in the process, you've learned that using tools 
like saws and socket wrenches doesn't require any sort of real skill 
and that elbow grease does not exist (in this world, sanding is a 
matter of toggling the ``plane'' from side to side for about six seconds). 
Paint dries instantly, and Undo negates everything. In the Storage 
Shed, you can create your own ``surprise sculptures,'' but the only 
choice is the ``material'' you're going to use: wood, metal or stone. 
Once selected, a hunk of the stuff magically appears. ``Grab a tool,'' 
Tonka Joe yells, ``and start chipping away!'' But it doesn't matter 
if you use a hammer or a drill, a socket wrench or a saw. All the 
tools do the same thing. They make chipping noises while bits of the 
block fly off, revealing ... a concrete gorilla! A wooden cabinet! 
A jungle gym, chipped from solid stainless steel with a spray can. 
After that, you can move on to the Tool Challenge, where the object 
is to pull the plastic saw back and forth as fast as you can for 30 
seconds. ``You earned a medal on the scoreboard!'' Tonka Joe declares. 
``The most skilled craftsman can win all six!'' The child is given 
no choice here, no goal, no understanding of what's going on or why. 
This software doesn't just fail to simulate real-world tools; it actually 
makes a mockery of tools. It mocks the notion of craftsmanship. It 
mocks the idea that skill is necessary in any context or that you 
would even want to know how things are made. Milk comes from cartons, 
and software comes from disks that prompt you to click Next, Next 
and Finish. No need to understand. It's magic. That is an infantile 
attitude. And it's almost forgivable when you're dealing with a computer 
operating system. But it's appalling when you're dealing with a hammer 
because even 3-year-olds can understand a hammer and what it does, 
and how, and why. Even 3-year-olds can build things and understand 
tools and materials, and what it means to struggle with and master 
them. It doesn't matter whether the tools and materials are physical 
or virtual, crayons or Play-Doh or Lincoln Logs or digital paint software. 
The task is real, and the lessons are real. The skills outlast the 
project. And even if the end result is taken apart or deleted or smushed, 
it has given a kid the chance to be creative and self-expressive. 
None of that is possible with this product. The most creative thing 
a kid can do with Tonka Joe's ``projects'' is print them out (in black 
and white), color them in, then run and say, ``Hey, Mom, look at this 
doghouse I ... printed out.'' When we're adults, there is time enough 
to be helpless and ignorant about how our tools work. We should at 
least let our kids be capable and knowledgeable as long as they possibly 
can, while they're still innocent enough to know what they're doing.
