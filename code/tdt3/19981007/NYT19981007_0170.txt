The strange red mark that kept showing up on the arms and bellies 
of wide receivers was quickly named ``the Elway cross.'' As soon as 
the quarterback John Elway came into the National Football League, 
he became known for his rifle arm and rope-straight spiral. Today, 
with a Super Bowl victory to his credit at last, Elway holds another 
record, widely publicized by the Oddzon toy company. He has thrown 
the finned Koosh Vortex Mach 110 more than 110 yards. Oddzon began 
as the maker of the Koosh ball. Today, as part of Hasbro, the toy 
giant, it belongs to the same family as Nerf, its distant rival. Together, 
Koosh and Nerf are building better balls _ and the guns to fire them. 
Both Nerf, the ball of one generation, and Koosh, that of the next, 
quickly evolved into other products _ for instance, backboards and 
hoops for closet doors. Housed in the same Silicon Valley industrial 
park as high-tech neighbors like Zilog, the semiconductor maker, Oddzon 
is a strange combination of off-the-wall invention and industrial 
design. Experimental balls sail through its parking lot at lunch; 
a few months later, they sail across kids' rooms and yards. Tom Grimm, 
the vice president of product development, recently put out a call 
on the Internet for Stanford design school graduates for his staff. 
Hits in the $14 billion toy business _ two-thirds of whose products 
are new each year _ are hard to come by. For this reason, Hasbro, 
which just announced the closing of its last factory in Rhode Island, 
where it has its headquarters, keeps Oddzon and Larami (the water-gun 
people), its corporate sibling, off on their own, uncontaminated by 
the slow product cycles of the company's older units. Oddzon will 
soon be testing balls in a new headquarters in Napa. The company began 
like a small electronics company, from the simple idea of the Koosh 
ball _ named for the sound it ostensibly makes. The prototype was 
an assemblage of rubber bands designed to teach children to play catch. 
Then one day, an aerospace engineer named John Hunter walked into 
the Oddzon offices with the idea for the Vortex. The Vortex is more 
complicated than it looks. It took intensive research to figure out 
the need for different gripping materials and the most gentle of ribbings 
on the not-quite-symmetrical ball. The Vortex Howler added a sort 
of whistle to the foam ball; the smaller Pocket Vortex and the Mega 
Vortex followed. Not content with test tosses down the hall and across 
the lot, Oddzon developed a catapult to create constant throws, hired 
testers and even cemented thin white threads to test balls to study 
their aerodynamics. Dr. Ilan Kroo, an aeronautical engineer at Stanford, 
looked at ``the issue of boundary layer adhesion'' _ stall factor 
and drag, in fancy terms. Holding test balls out the window of a speeding 
car provided an adequate wind-tunnel substitute. The Wright Brothers, 
after all, used a bicycle for the same purpose. The latest product 
in the Oddzon family is the Tornado, a spring-loaded launcher for 
rubber rings that simultaneously sail and hang when Grimm fires them 
across the office. ``That's what we call the `wow' factor,'' he said. 
This contrasts with the ``aspirational factor'' of a product like 
the Vortex: be like Mike, throw like John Elway. With the Vortex, 
I can throw a spiral every time. I couldn't replicate Elway's 110 
yards, but with the Tornado, I achieved the promised 70-foot flight 
almost every time. The idea for the Tornado, which the company hopes 
will be a big Christmas hit, came from 1950s design for ring-shape 
artillery shells, which would travel farther and straighter, thanks 
to their aerodynamic qualities. It took months, however, to ``prove 
the physics,'' as Grimm put it, and determine the ``spring efficiencies.'' 
For the final product, the challenge was to find just the right spring 
strength and wrap it all in a shape that wasn't too gunlike to turn 
off parents _ a style Grimm calls ``swoopy doopy.'' The resulting 
shapes are as exaggerated as the language on the box: ``awesome pinpoint 
accuracy!'' and ``incredible distance!'' The old hard sell lives on 
at Toys ``R'' Us. Across the country in Cleveland, Nerf has also moved 
beyond its original ball into a line of guns that fire sponge darts 
and disks. They bear such names as Expand-a Blast, Ratchet Blast and 
Pulsator. Nerf and Koosh seemed poised to compete on the fun-gun battlefield. 
Do balls lead inevitably to guns? I wondered. When I tested the Vortex 
110, I was able to throw it only 60 yards or so. Was there a lesson 
there? However much you improve the ball, it's the rifle arm behind 
it that makes the difference.
