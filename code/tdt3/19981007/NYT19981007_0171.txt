How many conservative economists does it take to change a light bulb? 
Heard any good anecdotes about Canadian actors lately? Know any good 
songs about Socrates? What do these questions have in common? The 
answer to each may be found at an unlikely reference source, the Webliography 
for Humour. Compiled by librarians at Mount Royal College, Calgary, 
Canada, it provides more than 50 links to such strenuously nonacademic 
sites as the Dr. Seuss Parody Page, the Dilbert Zone and the Doonesbury 
Town Hall. It also lists some Web sites that at first glance (only) 
might seem to belong in a college library: the First International 
Virtual Conference on Mad Science, the Journal of Nursing Jocularity 
and Philosophy Songs. The Webliography for Humour (www.mtroyal.ab.ca/programs/academserv/lib/Subguide/sghumour.htm) 
isn't the only Web-site compilation that can be found on the library's 
Web pages, but it is one of the more popular. It was compiled by Margy 
MacMillan, the library's Internet coordinator. ``The subject webliographies 
were set up as a way of providing quick access to good information 
for our students here at the college,'' she said. ``When I was putting 
the original webliographies together in the summer of 1997, I came 
across so much good, funny stuff that I had to put a humor webliography 
together. ``In the 1997-98 academic year, it received 226 hits, more 
than many of our serious webliographies, including the one for libraries. 
The webliography has proved very popular with faculty, although to 
my knowledge none of them have yet incorporated it into curriculum.'' 
She's happy to say that she hasn't had any complaints. ``There is 
after all a serious academic connection to most of the sites listed,'' 
she insisted. Like the Jean-Paul Sartre Cookbook? ``OK, some of them 
are kind of academic in tone. Well, in a way.'' Ms. Macmillan's favorite 
link on the list is the Dr. Seuss Parody Page (klinzhai.iuma.com/drseuss/seuss/seuss.parody.html), 
which is also, coincidentally, one of the most popular sites listed 
in the webliography. ``Hasta la Vista and the Old English Computer 
Glossary are tied for second on my list,'' Ms. MacMillan added, referring 
to a pair of clever sendups of computer jargon and search engines. 
Incidentally, a site called Jokes About Economists and Economics (netec.wustl.edu/jokec.html) 
features five different answers to the question ``How many conservative 
economists does it take to change a light bulb?'' The best: ``None. 
They're all waiting for the unseen hand of the market to correct the 
lighting disequilibrium.''
