Retrieving information from an increasingly tangled World Wide Web 
is one of the most common online activities. Retrieving information 
that's actually useful is far more rare. While search engines mostly 
use roving software robots to scour the Web, the Mining Co. (www.miningco.com), 
a relatively new vehicle on the information superhighway, is trying 
to prove that it has found a higher technology: the human brain. Since 
February 1997, the Mining Co. has built its Internet information gathering 
power on the shoulders of scores of people, called guides, scattered 
over the planet. Each guide, a specialist in a topic of Web interest, 
like politics, humor or jazz, is responsible for searching the Internet 
and listing and building the best Web sites in their subjects. ``Our 
guides use search engines that pull up all that stuff and then they 
pick the gems out, polish them and present them,'' said Scott Kurnit, 
the president, chief executive and founder of The Mining Co. The guides, 
which must complete an intensive 15-week training course, are also 
expected to regularly moderate online chats, maintain bulletin boards, 
write original material and promptly answer e-mail from users. Underscoring 
The Mining Co.'s uniquely human quality, head shots with accompanying 
names (and biographies on demand) of the guides are a common part 
of the sites. They tend to keep search results from overwhelming users 
by eliminating irrelevant and repetitious Web sites, as well as dead 
links. For instance, a broad search done this week on the single word 
``Clinton'' using Alta Vista found 1.8 million Web pages, the first 
one being ``Presbyterian College, Clinton, S.C;'' the same search 
on The Mining Co. found 1,568 documents, the first one being ``Starr's 
End Game - U.S. Politics'' a grouping of information and resources 
complied by a guide, Rowena Wall, who has worked on various political 
campaigns. ``Until software becomes much more intelligent and can 
filter out the garbage, humans can do this better,'' said Michael 
Griffis, a stocks guide (http://stocks.miningco.com) for The Mining 
Co. in Aurora, Ohio. His wife, Susan Griffis, is also a guide for 
cookbooks (http://cookbooks.miningco.com). The dependence on guides 
differs, said officials for The Mining Co., from the Internet search 
giant Yahoo that uses some people to build and maintain its directory 
of sites, but still heavily depends on machines to do much of the 
work. This is esepcially evident, some critics of Yahoo say, when 
a search can't be satisfied by Yahoo's directory the search is then 
automatically routed to a traditional search engine. But a spokeswoman 
for Yahoo suggested that the company's use of people, while not disclosing 
how many, to assemble and manage its directory of sites makes The 
Mining Co. less distinctive than purports to be. In fact, an open 
search of the word ``Clinton'' on Yahoo found 541 sites organzied 
into 50 categories, the first one being ``government: U.S. government: 
Politics: Political Issues: Clinton administration.'' But The Mining 
Co. maintains that its especially personal touch and depth of guide 
expertise and passion in their areas makes it unique on the Internet. 
``Where we are similar to Yahoo we think we do a better job,'' said 
Jake Levich, The Mining Co. senior editor. Today the service has 639 
guides in more than 20 countries all wired together by the same Internet 
technology that they serve. The Mining Co., says Kurnit, covers 12,000 
topics for three million regular users. The guides have 350,000 links 
to Web sites, 75,000 pages of its own content and 360 electronic newsletters. 
And while the privately held company is not yet turning a profit, 
people are discovering the service. Media Metrix, which measures the 
traffic of the Internet, listed The Mining Co. as 85 in November 1997 
among sites accessed from home and work. Last month, the most recent 
information available, the service was placed at 43 in that category. 
The company gets revenue through advertising. Guides are paid a percentage 
of those revenues based largely on the popularity of their sites, 
Kurnit said. For example, the service's most visited site, one about 
video game strategies, earned its guide $5,000 last month. Other guides 
could make as little as $100 a month. Kurnit said an added benefit 
of having people so involved in creating and maintaining the service, 
which he describes as a hybrid of an online community and navigation 
tool, is that it brings together people as well as information. ``First 
and foremost people are looking for directory assistance on the Internet,'' 
said Kurnit. ``They are generally not happy with what they've found.''
