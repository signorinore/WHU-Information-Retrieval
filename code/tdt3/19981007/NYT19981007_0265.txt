Among the many pleasures of Richard Panek's elegant new book, ``Seeing 
and Believing: How the Telescope Opened Our Eyes and Minds to the 
Heavens,'' is its epigraph by John Cheever: ``The children have built 
something out of an orange crate, something preposterous and ascendant. 
...'' This poetically captures the technical side of Panek's story, 
the children being mankind, the orange crate being the telescope, 
and the ``something preposterous and ascendant'' being audacious new 
theories about the universe that time and again defied what passed 
for common sense. Panek's story begins, of course, with Galileo in 
November 1609, improving a rumored novelty involving the correct alignment 
of two lenses in a leaden tube and his use of it to discover other 
planets in our solar system. From here the author traces the technical 
progress of the telescope through lengthening, the addition of a magnifying 
eye piece and the placement of measuring devices within. A crucial 
discovery along the way was that observing the heavens had less to 
do with magnification than with the gathering of light, and this led 
to the use of telescopes with mirrors, photography and spectroscopy 
or the passing of telescoped light through a prism to analyze its 
sources. Only with the development of the radio telescope was it discovered 
that ``visible light covered only 2 percent of the electromagnetic 
spectrum,'' Panek writes. But with the coming of the computer and 
the space satellite, astronomers could drill a ``hole ... through 
the heavens,'' as Panek puts it. In December 1995, the Hubble Space 
Telescope revealed that the universe comprised not 10 billion galaxies, 
as had been previously thought, but some 50 billion. All this amazing 
technical evolution is described here with clarity and ease. Panek 
is a freelance reporter, an award-winning short-story writer and the 
author of ``Waterloo Diamonds,'' a social history of an Iowa community 
told through its baseball fortunes. He writes about science with practiced 
fluency. If you haven't yet gotten matter like quasars, pulsars and 
gamma rays entirely straight in your mind, this book will prove invaluable. 
But what makes ``Seeing and Believing'' most unusual is the way Panek 
treats the implications of his history, the way he shows how the telescope's 
development moved in advance of mankind's understanding. To convey 
this as vividly as he does requires a skill just as demanding as the 
ability to explain new developments, namely a capacity to imagine 
and make clear how people saw things in the past. The metaphor he 
uses to describe how the telescope affected human consciousness begins 
with the discovery of perspective in Italian Renaissance art, which 
served to eliminate what he calls ``the sacred backdrop of old, the 
golden or black curtain against which saints and Savior had enacted 
their symbol-drenched dramas.'' He continues: ``The uniform backdrop 
of old was a presence that didn't fully reveal itself until it was 
absent. Only then did it yield its secrets: how it had represented 
an unwavering, unthinking assumption; how its uniform surface of gold 
or black provided a sensibility unto itself; how that sensibility 
reflected a singular point of view, saints of a certain size, Virgin 
of another, Jesus of a third, all arrayed according to a hierarchy 
that could belong only to the mind of God. But now it was gone, and 
what replaced it was a point of view that could belong only to the 
human eye _ and only to an eye seeing the world as if for the first 
time.'' Two centuries later, with Galileo's use of the telescope in 
1609, ``man had completed the intellectual journey he had begun'' 
with ``the introduction of perspective into art,'' Panek continues. 
The sacred backdrop had become a curtain to be opened, and ``man had 
gone from being the apple of God's eye to being God's eye.'' With 
similar verve, ``Seeing and Believing'' describes the shock of all 
the revolutions created by the telescope. As Panek sums up: ``The 
flatness of Earth, the immobility of the globe, the perfectly circular 
paths of the planets, the earth's position at the center of the Kosmos, 
the sun's position at the center of a new cosmos, the fixed positions 
of the stars, the stars themselves as the extent of the universe, 
the universe as all that we could ever hope to see, and all we could 
ever hope to see as all there is _ all the assumptions safely based 
on observation were gone.'' As for the tool that swept these assumptions 
away: ``Now, in the aftermath of the New Astronomy of invisible light, 
to say nothing of the dark matter revolution, it turned out that the 
instrument in any incarnation came with its own inherent set of limitations, 
not on what to expect or where to look, but on how to look, not on 
the available information, but on the nature of the information itself.'' 
Yes, the children have built something out of an orange crate, something 
preposterous and ascendant. And Panek has shown how those who built 
ascendant things kept falling down, only to discover that the place 
they had fallen down to was wonderfully different and very strange. 
As he himself sums up the case he has so persuasively made in ``Seeing 
and Believing,'' ``The relationship between the telescope and our 
understanding of the dimensions of the universe is in many ways the 
story of modernity.'' PUBLICATION NOTES: `SEEING AND BELIEVING' How
