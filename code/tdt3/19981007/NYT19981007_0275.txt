We might think we know her; after all, she kept telling us Tuesday 
night at the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., 
that she loved us. But mostly all we know of Janet Jackson is the 
family photos, the love for children and animals. And the numbers: 
No. 2 in most Top 10 hits of all female artists; No. 7 in most Top 
10 hits of all artists; most gold singles by a female artist. The 
statistics go on and on. There's too much index, not enough text. 
We don't really know her, we can't feel her anxieties. So she has 
adopted a theme of revelation to prove to everybody _ but most of 
all to herself _ that she has secrets worth telling. Usually a nobody 
balloons into a pop icon and then hits a period of maturation and 
withdrawal, constructing a more delicate and guarded personality. 
Ms. Jackson, conversely, has upon turning 30 taken to making interview 
pronouncements like, ``You have to let go in order to truly be in 
control.'' She has a wrist tattoo of a South African symbol that represents 
the wisdom in learning from the past, whereas most pop stars would 
prefer to focus on the future. As she struggles to get over her fame, 
there's a diffuse grandiosity about her, and a result is that the 
deluxe, multipartite dimensions of the ``Velvet Rope'' tour look a 
little awkward. Her personality is small, coy and secretive; would 
anyone's be great enough to sustain the three-ring circus of self-analysis 
that this tour presents? The tour, which began in March and is to 
run through January, includes spectacular costumes and dance sequences, 
from zoot-suited chorus lines to Alice-in-Wonderland playgrounds of 
inflatable moons and clocks. (It continues Sunday and Monday at Madison 
Square Garden in Manhattan, and will be shown live on HBO on Sunday 
night at 9.) But in its act-by-act progression it feels a little bit 
like a short story writer's disjointed attempt at a novel. It would 
be unrealistic to expect thematic cohesion in a massive pop show; 
one just watched the flashpots explode and let the connecting theme 
be Janet Jackson. But who was she? As ever, she was her songs: the 
furious, betrayed lover in ``What About,'' the drama-queen seductress 
toying with a trussed-up audience member in ``Rope Burn,'' a dance-floor 
sensualist in ``Throb,'' a soft-focus nostalgist screening her baby 
pictures in ``Special,'' a pillar of empathy in ``Together Again.'' 
She physically inhabited each song, glared stonily in the angry ones, 
smiled beatifically in the ballads. And she blended into her touring 
company. Ms. Jackson's Tinkerbell voice wove in and out of her backup 
singers' strong projection; judging when and whether she was lip-synching 
became the evening's fascinating game. Surrounded by 10 dancers _ 
whom she took longer to introduce than her band _ Ms. Jackson integrated 
her own dancing and singing into a larger phalanx of action. Her identity 
was subsumed by the production. There was quite a bit of Ms. Jackson 
_ her stamina and professionalism in a long, intensely physical concert 
were remarkable _ but an awful lot of show. As opposed to the range 
of intents on Ms. Jackson's palette, Usher, who opened the concert, 
is monochrome: a one-man erotic arrow aimed at teen-age girls. Bejeweled 
from collar to sneakers, he sang bubble-gum R-and-B; in each song, 
to the crowd's huge delight, he promised relief and satisfaction. 
There was a weird disjunction between the cooing kid-stuff sheen of 
his songs and his undiluted sexual posturing onstage, which included, 
most memorably, pouring a bottle of water down his midriff and pumping 
his hips so that the water splashed forth toward the audience.
