Much has been made of Bill T. Jones' recent turn toward abstraction 
after a series of full-evening dramatic dances, parables for our time 
that explored a variety of social themes. But those who have seen 
his shorter pieces could not have been surprised by Jones' latest 
work, ``We Set Out Early . . . Visibility Was Poor,'' performed by 
the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company on Tuesday night at the 
Brooklyn Academy of Music as part of the Next Wave Festival. Jones' 
theme dances have had the messy, bold vitality of still-wet clots 
of color patched from a palette knife onto a painting. Both the shorter 
works and this new suite of three dances are elegant fashion photography 
with undercurrents of mostly uncategorizable emotions. The emotions 
are heightened and deepened in ``We Set Out Early,'' however, signaling 
the possibility of a provocative merging of genres in the future. 
Jones himself opened the evening with ``Prelude,'' a solo that captured 
his unsettling mix of wariness and sensuality with simple stretching, 
oozing motion and an increasingly extemporized, mocking version of 
the folk song ``Billy Boy.'' The new dance began with ``On the TSII,'' 
set to Stravinsky's ``Histoire du Soldat,'' one of the most difficult 
but apparently unignorable dance scores of the 20th century. Superficial 
posing for its first three-quarters, ``On the TSII'' had the dancers 
interacting suavely with a ballet barre and puzzlingly cawing and 
cheeping like birds with a lead bird, Germaul Barnes, wearing a bunched 
tail of extra fabric. A late sudden explosion of electric energy set 
a contrasting tone for the piece that followed, ``Cape Bardo,'' set 
to John Cage's ``Empty Words, Sonata and Music for Marcel Duchamp.'' 
The title ``We Set Out Early'' suggests a slow trajectory through 
time. This second section, ``Cape Bardo,'' might symbolize the cool 
respite of post-modernism after the hectic, edgy energies of a young 
century, represented by the Stravinsky score. In the dance, a measured 
processional with overtones of Jerome Robbins' ``Watermill'' and Paul 
Taylor's ``Rune,'' the luminous Eric Bradley warms up at the front 
of the stage as a slow-moving couple walk by in the shadows at the 
back, followed by dancers who emerge from and disappear into the darkness. 
Cage posited that sounds and silence were music. Jones turns the gradual 
dismantling of a large, sleek overhanging steel sculpture from the 
first act into understated theater and dance, most magically when 
the lines of the poles and the dancers' limbs merge inseparably into 
a shimmering thicket of horizontal parallels. Above, a huge, glowing, 
white paper lozenge moves slowly and inexorably across the stage and 
disappears, followed by the rise of the dismantled sculpture. ``Voiceland,'' 
the new work's third section, uses an emotion-drenched score by a 
Latvian composer, Peteris Vasks, as a charged aural landscape for 
a cluster of silently jabbering, scrabbling men and women. They might 
be doomed survivors of some cataclysm, their lives at first circumscribed 
by the rectangles made by the overhanging sculpture and by light. 
Their moves are tinged with late-20th-century disco and street dancing. 
There are moments of uncomplicated joy and affection, in early bounding 
runs and gentle and thwacking embraces. Bradley and the quietly eloquent 
Rosalynde LeBlanc draw near as hushed young lovers. But panic overtakes 
them all in dance that paradoxically builds with the music as gesture 
and situation become increasingly distilled. Jones, his set designer, 
Bjorn Amelan, and the lighting designer, Robert Wierzel, have a grand 
vision, and they achieve it, in a time when many artists seem embarrassed 
by the idea of grandeur. The strong cast also included Miguel Anaya, 
Alexandra Beller, Christian Canciani, Daniel Russell Kubert, Toshiko 
Oiwa, Odile Reine-Adelaide and Maya Saffrin. Liz Prince designed the 
stylish costumes. Gregory Bain was the production director.
