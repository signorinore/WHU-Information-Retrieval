Even as we overdose on the coverage of the frenzied, sex-based madness 
in Washington, the tragic subjugation of nearly the entire female 
population of Afghanistan goes scarcely noticed. Consider this fatal 
catch-22. By order of the Taliban, the extremist Islamic movement 
that controls most of the country, Afghan women are not allowed to 
work or go to school. That means female doctors, with very few exceptions, 
cannot practice, and women who want to be doctors cannot be trained. 
But male doctors are not allowed to see or touch the bodies of female 
patients. Thus, health care for most women has effectively vanished. 
Women and girls, including babies, are dying needlessly from illnesses 
that are left untreated. Physicians for Human Rights, which shared 
the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize for its role in the International Campaign 
to Ban Landmines, recently concluded a study of the conditions confronting 
the women of Afghanistan under the rule of the Taliban. The executive 
director, Leonard Rubenstein, said in an interview Wednesday, ``We 
are not aware of any place in the world in recent history where women 
have so systematically been deprived of every opportunity to survive 
in the society _ from working to getting an education to walking on 
the street to getting health care.'' The researchers, in their report, 
described Kabul, the Afghan capital, as a city of beggars, with ``women 
who had once been teachers and nurses now moving in the streets like 
ghosts under their enveloping burqas, selling every possession and 
begging so as to feed their children.'' They said the restrictions 
on the examination and treatment of sick and injured women had reached 
``extreme dimensions.'' They wrote: ``(Physicians for Human Rights) 
interviewed a male physician and asked how he would treat an ailing 
woman patient. He indicated that in some cases a male relative could 
point on his own body to places where the patient felt pain, and he 
would prescribe medication for the male relative to procure for her.'' 
A woman who ran a clinic with her husband was ordered by the Taliban 
to shut it down. She told a Physicians for Human Rights researcher: 
``When I tried to reason with them, they beat me and told me that 
they would hang me if I showed up again at the clinic.'' The clinic 
was closed ``within 24 hours.'' Zohra Rasekh, a senior health researcher 
and one of the authors of the report, was chased by a young man wielding 
a metal cable because her wrists had been exposed in public. She said 
she narrowly escaped a beating. Inevitably, large numbers of women 
and girls are finding themselves in desperately poor health. A woman 
was reported to have died of appendicitis after she was turned away 
from two hospitals. Researchers were told in separate interviews of 
two women who had diabetes and were denied insulin at a clinic. Both 
were reported to have died. A nurse told researchers that many women 
were dying at home during labor. A pharmacist said, ``It is very difficult 
for pregnant women since male doctors are prohibited from seeing pregnant 
women and performing delivery. A lot of pregnant women die at home 
and in hospitals and clinics.'' Major depression and other psychiatric 
disorders are widespread. A sense of hopelessness prevails, and suicide 
is a growing problem. Said one young woman: ``Two years ago I graduated 
from Kabul University, but now the university door is closed to all 
female students. Afghan women have no rights today. They are all walking 
deads.'' Women's rights groups in the United States, led by the Feminist 
Majority Foundation, are trying to mount a campaign on behalf of the 
women in Afghanistan. They are modeling the campaign on the worldwide 
effort that helped bring down the system of racial apartheid in South 
Africa. ``It's so horrific,'' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the 
foundation. ``We thought that as a group if we could not arouse the 
public on this, then what are we talking about when we say that women 
are going forward? ``We have to care about this. I mean, to what level 
can women be reduced? What's OK? If this is OK, it means we become 
this class of people that you can do anything to.''
