For years, Forbes magazine staff members have murmured that James 
W. Michaels _ the magazine's legendary, cantankerous and perfectionist 
editor since 1961 _ would like to expire at his desk. But Michaels, 
77, will step aside on Jan. 1, 1999, to become a vice president of 
Forbes Inc., overseeing the editorial content that makes up the Web 
sites, books and television projects of the company. The managing 
editor, William Baldwin, 47, who joined the magazine as a reporter 
in 1980, will succeed Michaels as editor. Tim Forbes, chief operating 
officer of Forbes, said the move was made to accommodate Michaels' 
wishes to surrender the pressures of an intense biweekly deadline. 
Asked why he was leaving, Michaels would only say, ``My assignment 
now is to take what we've done with Forbes magazine and try to translate 
this into related fields.'' Michaels made a reputation as a big spender, 
with a fondness for tearing up pages at the 11th hour and reconceiving 
stories to accommodate breaking news at sometimes great cost. But 
Forbes said this was never an issue. ``Jim is indeed a perfectionist 
and we credit him with a great deal of the success Forbes has enjoyed,'' 
Forbes said. ``In such a context, it is not about expenses. His expenses 
in producing the magazine are utterly, utterly irrelevant.'' When 
Michaels joined the staff as a reporter in 1954, circulation was around 
325,000, according to a Forbes spokeswoman. In June 1998, the biweekly 
Forbes had an average paid circulation of 784,220, according to the 
most recent figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulation. In the last 
year, ad pages were down slightly, 3,016 pages in the first nine months 
of 1997 to 3,002 in the same period in 1998, but annual ad revenue 
rose 5.2 percent, to $165 million, from $157 million, according to 
estimates by the Publishers Information Bureau. Baldwin, who has pushed 
for more reporting on technology and telecommunications, became managing 
editor last year. Before that, he served as executive editor for five 
years. In quintessential Michaels style, Michaels spent much of Wednesday 
afternoon editing and rewriting the news release announcing his move. 
``I just wanted to make sure it sounded like Forbes,'' he said, ``and 
not like your typical press release.''
