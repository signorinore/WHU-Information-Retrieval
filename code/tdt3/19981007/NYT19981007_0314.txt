With his long hair and dark blue beret, Vladimir Tyuterev, 31, didn't 
look like most of the other demonstrators at Wednesday's mass protest 
in Moscow. He was not waving a red flag like the Communists. He was 
not dressed in black like the members of nationalist youth groups. 
He did not carry a placard calling for President Boris Yeltsin's resignation. 
And although he is a union representative at his government-financed 
forensic laboratory, he was not obligated to join the stream of marchers 
heading across the Moscow River to the slope beneath St. Basil's Cathedral. 
But on a bright cold autumn afternoon, he was there nonetheless, if 
for no other reason than to register his own private dissatisfaction. 
``There comes a time when you have to show that you don't accept what 
is going on,'' he said. ``The situation now is such that that time 
has come.'' The last time Tyuterev took to the streets was in August 
1991, when as a student he rallied to the defense of Yeltsin's besieged 
headquarters during the coup that set off the collapse of Communism 
in Russia. Tyuterev is not one who begrudges the changes of the last 
years. He and his wife, now on maternity leave with their 3-month-old 
baby, saved up enough one year to spend a month in India, the kind 
of private excursion that would have been impossible in Communist 
times. And so he has no sympathy for the Communists, who together 
with the labor unions organized Wednesday's demonstrations. ``I do 
not want a Communist comeback,'' he said. ``We didn't come here with 
red flags or anything like that.'' He is even ambivalent about calls 
for Yeltsin's resignation. ``Times change,'' he said. ``People change. 
In 1991 it was a time of euphoria. Our president has changed too.'' 
What he does want is a government that will take charge and get the 
Russian economy working again. ``For the past five years no one put 
any money in the real economy,'' he said, after complaining about 
his laboratory's woefully outdated and worn-out equipment. But mainly, 
like many other Russians with a university degree and miserably paid 
jobs, Tyuterev is tired of being ignored. His colleague Mark Sonis, 
a union official and senior expert at the Federal Forensic Center, 
was marching beneath a modest black-and-white cardboard sign that 
simply announced their presence. ``People are fed up with all this 
business,'' he said. Like other government workers, the forensic experts 
live on a fixed income _ although there is nothing fixed about a monthly 
salary of 1,200 rubles that did not materialize at all in September, 
which typically gets paid in dribs and drabs and which in dollar terms 
dropped from $200 to $80 after the ruble began its nosedive in August. 
Asked how he could support his family on such a sum at a time of surging 
inflation, Tyuterev shrugged and talked about the savings he figured 
would tide them through another month or two. Tyuterev's family lives 
with his wife's parents, and even before the current crisis, neither 
he nor his wife could think of buying a car, let alone their own apartment, 
so the postponement of such dreams for them is no tragedy. ``In Russia, 
people who work for the government are not middle-class, not by a 
long shot,'' said another colleague, Andrei Bobrov, 32, a ballistics 
expert and bachelor who lives with his mother, sister, brother-in-law 
and young nephew. There were times in the last few years that Bobrov 
was tempted to join friends in Moscow's booming private sector, but 
now, as those friends find themselves suddenly unemployed, he is just 
as glad he did not. ``One just called me this week to say he was going 
out to the countryside to dig for potatoes,'' he said. Bobrov has 
no time left for Yeltsin _ ``he is a clown'' _ and in the 1996 elections 
he voted first for Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of a liberal opposition 
party, and then in the second round ``against'' the Communist leader 
Gennadi Zyuganov, Yeltsin's chief opponent. But he still puzzles over 
the passivity of most Russians, who continue to put up with a miserly 
existence. ``A lot of people at the lab today were saying, `Why go?' 
'' said Bobrov. ``They all have their troubles, and they might come 
out and protest for themselves. But they won't do it for the sake 
of groups that they think will use them for their own temporary political 
motives.''
