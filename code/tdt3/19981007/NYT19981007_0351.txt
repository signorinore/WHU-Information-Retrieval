The U.S. government filed an antitrust lawsuit against Visa USA and 
Mastercard International on Wednesday, claiming that the nation's 
two biggest credit-card networks restrain competition and limit consumers' 
choices. The lawsuit, filed by the Justice Department in Manhattan 
federal court, challenges the control of both credit-card associations 
by the same set of banks, as well as the rules adopted by Visa and 
Mastercard that ban member banks from offering credit cards of competitors 
like American Express and Discover. ``These exclusionary rules deny 
consumers the ability to choose among a maximum variety of card products, 
Attorney General Janet Reno said in a statement. ``America's consumers 
have lost out.'' Executives from both Visa and Mastercard were quick 
to respond, saying they would fight the suit and insisting that their 
industry is among the most competitive in the country. ``Fundamentally, 
this is a solution in search of a problem,'' said Paul Allen, executive 
vice president and general counsel for Visa USA. ``Consumers know 
that if they want a payment card, they can get it very easily and 
have unlimited choice,'' he added. ``Competition in the marketplace 
is the litmus test of antitrust laws. And it doesn't seem to me that 
consumer choice has been diminished.'' Competitors were elated at 
the lawsuit. ``I am thrilled,'' said Philip Purcell, chairman and 
chief executive of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the financial-services 
company that owns the Discover card. ``The Justice Department has 
studied competition in the industry very intensely, and it took a 
lot of tenacity and courage to come out with the lawsuit.'' The lawsuit 
followed a two-year investigation of the credit-card industry following 
complaints by American Express Co. In a statement on Wednesday, American 
Express called the lawsuit ``a major step toward breaking the illegal 
stranglehold that Visa and Mastercard have had on the card industry 
for years.'' The lawsuit also got a positive response on Capitol Hill. 
``Mastercard and Visa's practices are blatantly anti-competitive,'' 
Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said in a statement. ``I strongly 
support the Department of Justice in this action.'' As of midyear, 
Visa and Mastercard accounted for 75 percent of credit-card sales, 
according to the Nilson Report, a credit-card industry newsletter 
published in Oxnard, Calif. American Express accounted for 18 percent 
of sales and Discover 6 percent. Diners Club purchases were 1 percent 
of the total. But David Robertson, president of the Nilson Report, 
said those figures are misleading. And he said he saw little benefit 
to consumers if the Justice Department wins the lawsuit. ``The competition 
is not between Visa and Mastercard,'' he said. ``The competition is 
between the banks that issue the cards. ``This lawsuit is supposed 
to be pro-consumer,'' he added. ``For the life of me I can't figure 
out how it is pro-consumer, because this is a fabulous time for cardholders 
right now. Competition has gotten so intense that there are no fees 
for Visa and Mastercards. In addition, consumers are being offered 
cards with very high lines of credit.'' Indeed, some argued that if 
the Justice Department prevailed, the net effect on consumers might 
be negative, particularly if banks are successful in issuing high 
numbers of American Express cards. Since it charges higher discount 
rates than either Mastercard or Visa, the number of merchants who 
accept American Express cards has declined in recent years. ``To the 
extent that more volume is done at the higher discount rates charged 
by American Express, I would say this has the potential to become 
anti-consumer,'' said Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein 
&AMP; Co. ``Ultimately, merchants will charge more to consumers for 
goods and services.'' Anita Boomstein, a partner specializing in financial 
services at the law firm of Hughes, Hubbard &AMP; Reed, said the government 
might have a difficult time proving its case. ``I don't necessarily 
agree with Justice's conclusions,'' she said. ``I am not sure Justice 
will be able to conclusively prove that the current structure has 
stifled competition.''
