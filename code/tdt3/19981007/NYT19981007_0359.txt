Prices on the Nasdaq stock market declined to their lowest level in 
15 months Wednesday and have fallen 17.25 percent in just the last 
eight days of trading. Other market gauges also continued to slump. 
Analysts continued to cite nervousness over financial and economic 
turmoil in many parts of the world and unmistakable evidence that 
the U.S. economy is being affected. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of 
the Federal Reserve, testified Wednesday that he is trying to avert 
a slowdown that many economists now fear could easily turn into a 
recession. Nasdaq stocks fell 3.2 percent, or 48.28 points Wednesday, 
to 1,462.61, a level not seen since July of last year. The Standard 
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index lost 1.41 percent, or 13.91 points, to 
970.68, and avoided a new low with a modest late-session rebound. 
The Dow Jones industrial average moved up in the morning but then 
faded to close with a loss of 1.29 points at 7,741.69. European markets 
were also mostly lower. Stocks fell 2.90 percent on the main German 
index, 1.24 percent in France and 52/100ths of 1 percent in Britain. 
Brazil's market closed 2.84 percent lower and the Nikkei index of 
225 issues jumped 6.17 percent, the biggest gain of the year, while 
the Hong Kong market rose 2.38 percent. Amid the general drubbing, 
however, analysts found some grounds for encouragement. One was that 
the march to lower interest rates, normally the stock investor's friend, 
stopped. ``This was one of the few days when stocks went down and 
the bond market didn't go up,'' said Christine Callies, chief investment 
strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``Possibly the capital flight 
into the U.S. dollar may be winding down.'' Investors around the world 
have been piling into Treasury securities as a safe haven so Wednesday's 
contrary action may suggest diminished worry about what has been described 
as the worst financial crisis since World War II. Analysts also pointed 
to some further signs that corporate profits in the third quarter 
may be a bit better than the market has been led to expect. Some multinational 
companies with sizable overseas earnings posted hefty market gains 
Wednesday, benefiting from the decline in the dollar on currency markets 
_ 2.3 percent on a trade-weighted basis. McDonald's, for example, 
rose 2 13/16, to 61 1/16, while Procter &AMP; Gamble rose 3[, to 77]. 
Banks and brokers, on the other hand, were pummeled again. Citicorp 
dropped 5 3/16, to 79 13/16, more than $100 a share less than the 
peak of $182 set April 6. Merrill Lynch fell 4 3/16, to 37}, barely 
one-third the stock's value of 109[ set four days before the Dow hit 
its record high of 9,337.97 on July 17. Bankers Trust, which traded 
as high as 136 7/16 in April, lost another 4[ Wednesday to close at 
49 3/16. The financial sector is exposed to meltdowns overseas and 
to hedge fund and other borrowers here whose ability to repay is in 
doubt. ``We have a tug of war going on between those who think international 
efforts to stem the financial crisis are working and those who think 
they're not doing enough,'' said Andy Brooks, head of stock trading 
at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. He said it seemed of late 
that ``all the forces at work in the market seem to be causing investors 
to be scared about staying in.'' Daniel Knight, portfolio manager 
at Columbine Asset Management in Colorado Springs, expressed frustration 
that several of the factors that have traditionally proved good predictors 
of stock valuations are no longer working. For example, he said stocks 
with high price-earnings ratios have ``dramatically'' outperformed 
stocks with low p-e's in recent months, reflecting investors' focus 
on big-name companies with growth stories at the expense of lesser 
companies with greater intrinsic value. Knight said this ``overreaction'' 
reflected shaken confidence on the part of investors, who in addition 
to favoring ``feel-good'' stocks are also paying more attention than 
in the past to companies with solid dividends. The Nasdaq's drop was 
marked by sizable losses in technology, its dominant category. Dell 
Computer fell 4}, to 50 9/16, Microsoft was down 3{, to 94[, Yahoo 
plunged 10 7/16, to 114] and eBay fell 5|, to 30~ after trading as 
high as 54\ when it first reached the market two weeks ago. On the 
New York Stock Exchange, new lows swamped new highs by 535 to 66 while 
declines outpaced advances by 2,136 to 1,012. Volume was heavy at 
977.05 million shares.
