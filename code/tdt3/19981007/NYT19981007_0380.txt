Testifying before Congress in June, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan called the U.S. economy the best he had ever seen. Less 
than four months later, he is trying to avert a slowdown that some 
economists now fear could easily turn into a recession. Speaking before 
a group of economists in Washington, Greenspan said Wednesday that 
the outlook for the United States had ``weakened measurably'' and 
hinted that the Fed was ready to reduce interest rates further if 
the financial turmoil that began last year in Asia continued to spread. 
Greenspan still marveled at the continuing combination of low inflation, 
low unemployment and steady U.S. growth, which have sustained what 
is about to become the nation's longest peacetime expansion. But he 
fretted about the ``somewhat scary psychology'' afflicting financial 
markets and focused on the expectation that consumers would sharply 
cut back their spending because of the steep drop in stock prices. 
And on a day when one of the nation's largest banks forecast that 
the United States will slip into recession next year, Greenspan suggested 
that the confusing and countervailing forces buffeting the economy 
have left policy makers without a clear idea of how serious a slowdown 
might be in the offing. ``The economy has remained in reasonable shape, 
with good growth and low if not declining inflation,'' Greenspan said 
in remarks in Washington to the National Association for Business 
Economics. ``But we are clearly facing a set of forces that should 
be dampening demand going forward to an unknown extent,'' he said. 
``We do not know how far it will go or how much it will affect consumer 
and business spending here at home.'' Greenspan went on to say that 
this is ``a time for monetary policy to be especially alert.'' Investors 
took that phrase to mean the Federal Reserve is prepared to follow 
up its quarter-point cut in the federal funds target rate last week, 
to 5.25 percent, with further reductions in coming months. A few hours 
after Greenspan spoke, economists at J.P. Morgan in New York became 
the first from a major institution to forecast a recession next year. 
Morgan said it expects no growth in the first quarter of 1999, a decline 
in economic output of 2 percent in the second quarter and 1 percent 
in the third quarter, followed by a return to growth of 1.5 percent 
in the fourth quarter. Morgan had previously projected growth of about 
1 percent over the next year. ``The extra weakness has been triggered 
by the further deterioration in domestic financial markets in recent 
weeks,'' said a report from James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at Morgan. 
``Although a downturn could still be avoided, it would likely take 
a prompt reversal of recent financial market deterioration, or particularly 
quick and aggressive support from policy easing. Neither are anticipated.'' 
While not ready yet to predict an end to the current expansion, which 
began in March 1991, other economists said they increasingly see the 
economy as fragile and vulnerable to further shocks. ``My sense is 
that recession risks have risen dramatically, that recession is just 
as likely as a normal slowdown now,'' said James Glassman, an economist 
at Chase Securities in New York. ``It wouldn't make sense for a Fed 
chairman to make that case, but if you read between the lines of his 
speech you can see a heightened concern about developments in the 
financial markets and tightening credit conditions.'' In his remarks 
Wednesday, delivered from notes rather than from his usual rigorously 
prepared text, Greenspan often seemed to be pondering how the United 
States had suddenly been put at risk by the forces that have sent 
Asia into a deep recession and spread through Russia into much of 
the rest of the world. ``I've never seen anything like this,'' Greenspan 
said at one point, referring to the flight of investors out of any 
instrument perceived to have some risk and into the safe haven of 
Treasury bonds, which are guaranteed by the U.S. government and are 
always easy to buy and sell. As usual, Greenspan presented both the 
positive and negative elements of the outlook, but analysts said his 
emphasis was on the risks to the economy, which he has laid out in 
increasingly explicit terms lately. Greenspan said the economy still 
had ``a fairly significant continued momentum.'' Its performance, 
he said, is ``really still quite an impressive sight,'' with job growth 
remaining healthy and inflation pressures muted. While he acknowledged 
that it was becoming more difficult and expensive for businesses to 
borrow money in the debt markets and from banks, Greenspan said that 
``we are far short of anything that could resemble a credit crunch 
in the United States.'' So far, Greenspan said, there is not much 
evidence of a slowdown in capital investment by business or on spending 
by consumers. ``In fact, if you look at the physical aspects of the 
economy as a whole, it is very difficult to find any real variable 
impact as yet,'' he said. While job growth slowed last month, unemployment 
claims remain low, ``and anecdotal evidence still indicates that we 
are confronted with fairly tight labor markets and labor markets which 
are still putting some pressure, if perhaps not accelerating, on the 
overall wage structure,'' he said. But Greenspan dwelled at length 
on the risks to the economy from the latest round of turmoil in the 
global markets, set off in August when Russia effectively defaulted 
on its debt, sending investors fleeing not just from other emerging 
markets, but also from high-yield ``junk'' bonds and other investments 
that suddenly seemed risky. Greenspan, who saw one of the underlying 
causes of the 1990-91 recession as a credit crunch stemming from problems 
in the banking business, said the problems facing the economy now 
would be exacerbated if lenders and investors continued to pull back. 
``What is occurring is a broad area of uncertainty or fear,'' he said. 
``And when human beings are confronted with uncertainty, meaning they 
do not understand the rules of the terms of particular types of engagement 
they're having in the real world, they disengage.'' The Fed chairman 
noted that exports were declining, hurting manufacturers and farmers. 
But he soon returned to the potential psychological shocks from the 
global turmoil, especially the effects on consumers of the stock market's 
downturn. He estimated that $1.5 trillion in wealth had been wiped 
out since the stock market's peak in July. ``It's got to show up somewhere,'' 
Greenspan said, adding that ``we're bound to see the major impact 
in personal consumption expenditures and housing,'' two sectors that 
have driven the economy for the past several years. William Dudley, 
an economist at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. in New York, said Greenspan's 
comments were ``very much slanted towards the risks to the economy'' 
and that his characterization of the economy as weakening measurably 
was ``a fairly strong statement from a Fed chairman known for being 
opaque.'' That Greenspan is acutely aware of how quickly the economy 
can slide into recession is understandable in light of his experience 
with the 1990-91 recession, when he, like most economists, failed 
to see at first that the economy had tipped from sluggish growth into 
economic contraction. ``We have not tilted down,'' Greenspan said 
in September 1990 _ two months after the recession later was shown 
to have started.
