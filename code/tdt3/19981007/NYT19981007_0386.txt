The world's finance ministers and central bankers ended five days 
of debate Wednesday with nothing approaching a strategy to lift the 
global markets out of their downward spiral, but with a plethora of 
new ideas that some officials insisted would ultimately bear fruit. 
All week the mood was so pessimistic that one European finance minister 
left Washington insisting, ``I've had more fun at funerals.'' At times 
the officials politely sparred with President Clinton and Michel Camdessus, 
the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. They argued 
over which European countries should cut interest rates and how much, 
and whether too much austerity imposed by the West would lead to the 
breakup of Russia or more bloodshed in Indonesia. But they agreed 
repeatedly and publicly that the chief villain in this drama is Japan, 
with a supporting cast of avaricious hedge fund managers and currency 
speculators. Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, the Thai finance minister, said 
``not much'' had been accomplished. He was treated as something of 
a cult hero because his country's economy has hit bottom and now seems 
to be crawling back. ``I'm afraid the markets will be disappointed,'' 
he said. Finance Minister Yannos Papantoniou of Greece agreed with 
the sentiment, bemoaning ``the lack of clear political will to move 
in any direction.'' Those who did not expect much progress nonetheless 
said they saw glimmers of hope. Weary from days of meetings and nights 
of glittering receptions that seemed oddly out of sync with the mood 
of gloom, they talked about Britain's proposal to establish what would 
amount to a Ministry of the Global Economy _ a standing committee 
on global financial regulation that would try to get the International 
Monetary Fund, financial regulators and private industry marching 
in a single direction. Many said the world now understood the dangers 
of financial secrecy, though they were bickering about just what kind 
of closely held data countries and financial institutions should publish. 
A few said President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, 
in confidential asides, had given assurances that they would pull 
$18 billion for the IMF out of Congress, an amount they have requested. 
What was missing was a parting message: that in tough times a strategy 
was emerging. ``What this whole thing is about is finding a catalyst 
that will restore confidence,'' said John R.H. Bond, the group chairman 
of HSBC Holdings PLC, whose Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank has done business 
in Asia for a century. ``But in this crisis there are so many players, 
so many different agendas, that turning it around will be very, very 
difficult.'' In an interview Wednesday, Rubin suggested that anyone 
who thought a meeting of 182 countries would come to hard and fast 
conclusions did not have realistic expectations. ``It was never going 
to come out with some highly momentous individual proposal,'' he insisted. 
``The question was, would it energize international action and a coalescence 
of views. And I think it unquestionably did. ``There are no magic 
wands,'' he added. ``These problems developed over many years, and 
it will take time to work them through.'' Rubin also made the case 
that there was now a consensus that there needed to be ``some private 
sector involvement'' in packages to aid affected countries _ financial 
code words meaning that big banks, investment houses and hedge funds 
that help drive countries to the brink ought to pay to clean up the 
mess. One of the biggest accomplishments, he said, was that ``everyone 
came out of the G-7 meeting with a shared sense of concern.'' He was 
referring to the huge gap between European and American views of the 
severity of the global downturn. Some members of the Group of Seven 
leading industrial countries, France and Germany in particular, argued 
until last week that Clinton's repeated references to the ``greatest 
financial challenges in a half-century'' were overdramatizing the 
problem. A senior European diplomat agreed with Rubin on Wednesday, 
saying his delegation of officials and bankers had ``left a lot more 
depressed than they arrived.'' Finance ministers spent part of the 
week trying to assess the president's political difficulties. Over 
breakfasts and lunches, ministers would ask reporters to put away 
their notebooks and then pepper them with questions about whether 
Clinton would survive the impeachment inquiry that was gathering steam 
two miles away. France proposed giving developing countries and the 
European Union more authority over the monetary fund, a plan that 
seemed to be aimed at diminishing America's near domination of the 
institution. Rubin politely dismissed the French plan with the suggestion 
that it should be studied at length _ the longer the better, he seemed 
to be saying _ but on Tuesday, Camdessus endorsed it, saying he offered 
his ``full support of the French suggestion.'' President Clinton's 
suggestion on Friday that the IMF change its strategy and develop 
a way to inoculate fundamentally healthy countries from economic contagion 
with pre-emptive aid packages led to public and private suggestions 
that it was time for Washington to come up with more cash before offering 
ideas on how to spend it. It seemed likely that Clinton's idea would 
eventually be accepted, but a top official of the monetary fund, Jack 
Boorman, said figuring out how it would work would take several months. 
Most of the other talk about creating a ``new international financial 
architecture'' involved plans that most of those attending said would 
require years to be enacted. The first may be new rules on what the 
financial community calls ``transparency'' _ requirements that countries 
divulge far more information about their finances to investors, making 
it harder to hide evidence of imminent economic disaster. Still, that 
is no guarantee. Investors ignored a good deal of data about impending 
trouble in Thailand and South Korea. The other key suggestions to 
emerge from these meetings will take even longer. Establishing rules 
for common financial accounting rules and for renegotiating bad debts 
when countries and their banks cannot pay may make sense, but they 
impinge on the sovereignty of individual nations. Giving broader powers 
to the IMF to cajole, and sometimes order, countries to lower their 
budget deficits or raise their taxes also would impinge on their sovereignty. 
``This is the basic dilemma of globalization,'' Papantoniou said. 
``Where do you draw the line between intervention and nonintervention?''
