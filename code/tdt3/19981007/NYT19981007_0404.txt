If the stock market is to be believed _ and that's rarely a good bet 
_ the prospect of mergers among online merchants in both books and 
music is dire news for Amazon.com Inc., the most popular store on 
the Internet. But in many ways, the prospect of two online deals represent 
an acknowledgment of just how strong a market position Amazon.com 
holds. ``There is a sentiment among merchants that Amazon is the Microsoft 
of E-commerce,'' said Scott Heiferman, the chief executive of I-Traffic, 
an ad agency that specializes in electronic commerce. ``There is a 
respect, a fear and a morbid fear. That's why people are bulking up.'' 
Shares of Amazon sank $14.875, or 14 percent Wednesday, to $93.4375. 
That follows the news Tuesday night that Bertelsmann AG, the German 
media conglomerate, would take a 50 percent stake in the online operation 
of Barnes &AMP; Noble, the country's largest bookstore chain. And 
on Wednesday CD Now and N2K, the two largest online music sellers, 
confirmed reports that they are discussing a merger. Jeff Bezos, the 
chief executive of Amazon dismissed the moves. ``From our point of 
view, nothing has changed,'' he said in an interview Wednesday. ``Our 
strategy is always customer obsession rather than competitor obsession.'' 
Analysts argued that it is the competition, in fact, that should be 
worried. ``There is an increasing sense of concern about whether the 
No. 2 player can survive,'' said Keith Benjamin, an analyst at BancBoston 
Robertson Stevens. ``With CD Now and N2K talking about merging and 
Barnes &AMP; Noble crying uncle, there is a pervasive fear among the 
wannabes.'' Benjamin said that the top company in each category appears 
to be getting the lion's share of business. As an example, he pointed 
to the surging profitability of Yahoo, the leader in what is known 
as Internet portals, all-inclusive guides to the Internet. On Wednesday, 
Yahoo announced that it earned $16.7 million, or 15 cents a share, 
far more than the 9 cents that analysts estimated. In the last year, 
investors leapt to buy stocks of Internet retailers because it seems 
so much more efficient to create a virtual store that can reach millions 
of people rather than build a chain of physical stores. In recent 
months, shares of online stores other than Amazon have fallen. Investors 
have realized that so far the efficiencies of the Internet have led 
to lower prices for consumers rather than higher profits for the merchants. 
Moreover, by traditional marketing measures many of the new online 
stores have spent so much on marketing and price cutting to gain customers 
that it is unclear whether they will ever earn a return on their investment. 
With 3.1 million book customers, Amazon has been able to start selling 
music at a lower cost than its competitors. ``The E-commerce market 
of music and video inherently has an extremely thin margin,'' said 
Richard Wolter, the chairman of Columbia House, the big music club 
owned by Time Warner Inc. and Sony Corp. ``The prize is going to the 
person who can leverage marketing efficiencies and customer relationships.'' 
Proponents of the two mergers say that the combination will help reduce 
the cost of winning new customers by lessening the competition by 
the merchants to buy the rights to be featured prominently on sites 
like Yahoo and America Online. Many of the online merchants flush 
with cash from their initial public offerings have offered millions 
or tens of millions of dollars to be exclusive book or music stores 
on the portal sites. ``I'm sure that AOL and the portals are not happy 
about this,'' Heiferman said. ``If you are auctioning some thing, 
it's better to have two buyers than one.''
