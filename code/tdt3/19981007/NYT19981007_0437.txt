Shares of AMP Inc. rose as much as 6.3 percent Wednesday as investors 
expressed optimism that legislation passed by the Pennsylvania House 
of Representatives late Tuesday could help Allied Signal in its $9.7 
billion hostile takeover bid for the company. The proposal, a series 
of amendments attached to another banking measure, specifies that 
during the 12 months after an unsolicited takeover bid for a company, 
shareholders can take action on the proposal only at a scheduled meeting. 
But a new amendment to the proposal would allow Allied Signal to call 
a special meeting of AMP shareholders to consider its offer to buy 
the electrical-connector maker for $44.50 a share. The legislation 
also rescinds severance packages, known as golden parachutes, recently 
put in place for a number of senior executives of AMP, based in Harrisburg, 
Pa. Investors reacted favorably to the news. AMP shares, after rising 
as high as $40, closed at $37.875, up 25 cents. ``The board should 
now instruct management to negotiate, with Allied Signal or any other 
third party, a fair price for all shareholders,'' said Peter Schoenfeld, 
chairman of P. Schoenfeld Asset Management, an investment advisory 
firm. Schoenfeld said his firm tendered ``several hundred thousand'' 
AMP shares to Allied. An AMP spokesman said the company was pleased 
with the support it had from the Legislature. Despite the House vote, 
uncertainties linger. The state Senate, now in recess, is not expected 
to vote on the bill before Tuesday. The Senate then could pass the 
legislation or change it, which could require another House vote. 
Although Gov. Tom Ridge has said he supports the AMP measure, he recently 
expressed concern about the bill to which the AMP amendments are attached: 
legislation intended to protect Mellon Bank Corp., based in Pittsburgh, 
from a hostile offer from the Bank of New York. In addition, a federal 
judge in Philadelphia is expected to rule as early as Thursday on 
whether Allied Signal can proceed with plans to gain control of AMP's 
board in order to rescind AMP's anti-takeover provision and force 
the company to consider its $44.50-a-share offer. If successful, the 
tender could make Allied the company's largest shareholder. By Wednesday, 
investors had tendered about 156.7 million, or 72 percent of the outstanding 
shares, to Allied, the company said.
