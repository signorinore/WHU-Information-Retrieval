MEXICO CITY _ U.S. officials announced Wednesday that drug and money-laundering 
charges had been filed against Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, the brother 
of a Mexican trafficker who died last year, and they said Carrillo 
had assumed control of the drug-smuggling cartel once led by his brother. 
But some U.S.n law-enforcement officials disputed the suggestion that 
a 15-month struggle for control of the cartel has ended, arguing that 
several violent factions continue to battle for control. The cartel, 
which smuggles billions of dollars' worth of cocaine, heroine and 
other drugs each year into Texas through Juarez, across from El Paso, 
Texas, was led by Amado Carrillo Fuentes until his death in July 1997 
at age 41. Vicente Carrillo, 35, was one of several lieutenants. In 
August 1997, a federal grand jury in El Paso handed down a 27-count 
indictment against Vicente Carrillo on drug and money-laundering charges, 
Bill Blagg, the United States attorney in El Paso, disclosed Wednesday. 
The indictment had been sealed, apparently to protect an investigation. 
Carrillo is believed to live in Mexico, where U.S. authorities say 
his organization pays millions of dollars each month to Mexican law-enforcement 
officials for protection. The main effect of the announcement Wednesday 
appeared to be to increase pressure on Mexican authorities to arrest 
Carrillo. The indictment charges Carrillo with smuggling more than 
four tons of cocaine and nearly five tons of marijuana into West Texas 
between 1985 and 1997. Prosecutors leading the grand jury proceedings 
originally sought charges against Amado Carrillo, Vicente Carrillo 
and Lino Herrera, another lieutenant, a U.S. official said. But before 
the indictment came down, Amado died of a medication overdose after 
plastic surgery. Within weeks, a succession struggle broke out, beginning 
when gunmen firing at Herrera sprayed a popular Juarez restaurant 
with bullets, killing Herrera and five bystanders. Mexican authorities 
said they believed the mastermind of that attack was Rafael Munoz 
Talavera, another cartel leader seeking control. Dozens of killings 
followed as factions led by Munoz, Vicente Carrillo and perhaps others 
fought for control. Last month, Munoz was found killed in Juarez. 
``The United States is seeking the man federal authorities believe 
is now in control of the Juarez cartel,'' the Justice Department said 
in a statement Wednesday. ``Authorities believe that as a result of 
the deaths of Amado Carrillo Fuentes and Rafael Munoz Talavera, Vicente 
Carrillo has assumed the leadership role of the Juarez cartel.'' But 
Bobby Castillo, the agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration's 
division in El Paso, said the struggle continues. ``I'd never say 
Vicente is the top dog now,'' he said. ``Vicente's a major player, 
but there are other factions around.'' Mexico was once dominated by 
a handful of well-defined cartels, he said. When leaders died or were 
arrested, new chieftains quickly seized control. In contrast, the 
drug underworld now appears to be fragmenting into smuggling armies 
who work with scores of sub-contractors. ``Before, there wasn't so 
much doubt about who is in charge,'' Castillo said. ``Now these organizations 
break into factions and it's not so easy to identify leaders.'' Washington 
has requested Carrillo's extradition, but Mexican judges have never 
ordered the extradition of a major trafficker.
