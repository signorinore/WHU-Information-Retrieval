Continuing to struggle in its construction operation and in its attempts 
to build a lean, integrated military electronics business, Raytheon 
Co. said Wednesday that it would expand layoffs and would not meet 
Wall Street's expectations for third-quarter earnings. The company 
had said earlier this year that it would shed about 8,700 jobs by 
the end of 1999. Wednesday, it raised that figure to about 14,000 
jobs, or roughly 16 percent of its work force. Raytheon spent almost 
$13 billion last year to acquire the military units of Hughes Electronics 
and Texas Instruments, and the company has been trying to squeeze 
costs from the combined operation ever since. As the jobs disappear, 
Raytheon, the No. 3 military contractor, intends to close operations 
in Texas, Washington, South Carolina, Massachusetts and California. 
Raytheon also said that its beleaguered engineering and construction 
business, which some analysts have urged the company to sell, had 
dragged down earnings for the third quarter. Analysts had predicted 
that the company would earn 90 cents a share, but in a statement Raytheon 
said its earnings would be ``slightly below'' that figure. In the 
statement, the company also said the weakness in the construction 
operation would lead it to take an after-tax charge of $284 million, 
or 83 cents a share. ``The good news is they are facing the problems 
square on and they are going to get rid of them,'' said Howard Rubel, 
who follows Raytheon for Goldman, Sachs. Referring to scheduled meetings 
Thursday between analysts and Raytheon's top management, he added, 
``The bad news is the earnings are a little bit light and the valuation 
is probably based on earnings, so the run-up in the shares on expectations 
of some very good strategic direction tomorrow will probably be over 
for a short while.'' Wednesday's announcement was a coming out of 
sorts for Daniel Burnham, Raytheon's president and chief operating 
officer. He joined the company 100 days ago after serving as vice 
chairman of Allied Signal Inc. His conference call Wednesday with 
reporters was his first since joining Raytheon. He is to take over 
as chief executive in December from Dennis Picard.
