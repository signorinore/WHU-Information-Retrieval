When the Bank of England's secretive Monetary Policy Committee decides 
Thursday whether to lower interest rates, its members may not be thinking 
too much about Hugh Morgan Williams. But he will most certainly be 
thinking about them. ``If rates don't move down at all, then my view 
of the Monetary Policy Committee is unprintable, absolutely unprintable,'' 
said Morgan Williams, whose company, Canford Audio PLC, makes products 
ranging from the devices used by the police to record witnesses' testimony 
to radio station control consoles. In the last year, he said, export 
earnings by his modest company in this blustery factory park in northeastern 
England have fallen because the strong British pound makes his products 
more expensive for foreign buyers. For every German pfennig added 
to the price of sterling, he said, his earnings in Germany shrink 
by $100,000 a year. Such tribulations have created a clamor from British 
business for lower rates and a weaker pound. Indeed, after Spain cut 
its benchmark rates half a point, to 3.75 percent, on Tuesday, there 
was a crescendo of demands for a cut in Britain's 7.5 percent benchmark. 
Even the government _ which last year handed over responsibility for 
setting rates to the Bank of England _ has acknowledged that the outlook 
has changed from the heady days earlier this year when Britain seemed 
to be emulating the United States' coupling of low unemployment and 
surging growth. Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown told the 
annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank 
in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, ``Slower world growth makes it inevitable 
that growth in Britain next year will be more moderate.'' Across the 
land, signs of a slowdown are apparent. Ford Motor Co.'s British subsidiary 
last month put the 4,400 workers in its Dagenham plant on a four-day 
week. This month, Rover Group, owned by BMW AG, said it would temporarily 
halt production of its 200 and 400 models in December, after announcing 
1,500 layoffs in July. The signs are all too familiar in the Washington 
region, where bust has followed boom with metronomic predictability 
_ from the gradual demise of coal mining and shipbuilding, beginning 
in the 1970s, to the Thatcherite 1980s, which marked Britain's decline 
as a manufacturing nation. The pound's rise during the last three 
years _ caused partly by investors' search for a hedge against the 
Euro, the single European currency set to be introduced next January 
_ has compounded other woes in a region that once looked to foreign 
investment as a panacea. The collapse of the global semiconductor 
industry contributed directly to the closing in August and September 
of two big plants by Siemens AG and Fujitsu, at a cost of 1,700 jobs. 
Almost every week, in a region stretching to Scotland, foreign companies 
have slashed work forces. National Semiconductor said just this week 
that it would shed 600 jobs at Greenock in western Scotland. The job 
losses have left few options for policy-makers, who have relied on 
foreign investment to create 75,000 jobs since 1986. ``Can anyone 
seriously suggest,'' said Sir George Russell, chairman of the Northern 
Development Co., a government agency, ``that this approach should 
be abandoned and something else put in its place?'' The fruits of 
those investments are clear. But with 9.1 percent unemployment _ almost 
twice the figure in the southeast _ and an economy that draws 44 percent 
of its output from exports, those chill winds are blowing again. ``We 
are much more vulnerable than most other regions,'' said Morgan Williams, 
who is also regional chairman of the Confederation of British Industries, 
the main employers' association. And though the pound has fallen 11 
percent against the German mark in six months, any sustained fall, 
he said, ``would take 18 to 24 months to have an impact on manufacturing.'' 
In this region alone in recent months, 4,500 manufacturing jobs have 
been lost _ but 6,000 have been created in businesses like telephone 
call-centers, which provide fewer full-time jobs and contribute less 
to local suppliers. Those companies that survive do so on leaner profits. 
While Siemens and Fujitsu are departing, the giant Nissan Motor auto 
factory near Washington has pledged not only to stay but also to expand. 
But profits will be down, reflecting the shock of the strong pound 
on a plant that produces 60 percent of the Nissans marketed in continental 
Europe. Morgan Williams' factory is much smaller, but the pressures 
are similar. This year, his company expects profits to be up, meaning 
that his 179 employees have not been threatened with layoffs. But 
expectations are lower. ``We managed to increase market share in Europe,'' 
he said, ``by accepting that we are not going to make a lot of money 
doing it.''
