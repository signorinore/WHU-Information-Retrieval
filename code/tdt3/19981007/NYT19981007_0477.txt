By an overwhelming bipartisan vote, the House of Representatives Wednesday 
bowed to the objections of environmentalists and the threat of a veto 
and rejected wide-ranging legislation on parks and public lands in 
dozens of states. The bill was an effort, in the closing days of the 
105th Congress, to combine scores of relatively minor and uncontroversial 
proposals involving trails, parks and other public lands with a few 
significant and hotly disputed changes in the management of big tracts 
of wilderness and national forest. It was supported by House Republican 
leaders. Among the provisions that the Clinton administration had 
opposed was a proposal by the bill's main author, Rep. James Hansen, 
R-Utah, to set aside for conservation the 630,000-acre San Rafael 
Swell, the rugged canyonlands where the outlaw Butch Cassidy used 
to hide out. Environmentalists also opposed it, saying it did not 
set aside enough land for wilderness and did not provide strict-enough 
protections. Other disputed provisions would have given the Chugach 
tribe in Alaska easements to build a road over sensitive lands, and 
eased logging and grazing on public lands that are susceptible to 
wildfires. The bill's resounding defeat, by a vote of 123 to 302, 
was a striking victory for environmental groups at a time when many 
provisions they oppose are tucked away in spending bills that Congress 
is considering this week. The opposition came mainly from liberal 
Democrats and centrist Republicans, although some conservative Republicans 
said they opposed the bill because it did not go far enough to protect 
private property owners. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., who leads 
a bloc of the party's pro-environment lawmakers, said the bill ``holds 
perfectly good projects hostage so as to jam through Congress bad 
policies that don't have a prayer of being adopted individually.'' 
But Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, who is chairman of the House Resources 
Committee, bluntly warned members not to seek his approval for their 
favorite park projects next year after voting against this bill.
