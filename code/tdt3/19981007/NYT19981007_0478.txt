Saying that he had found corruption in his own backyard, the chief 
federal prosecutor in Brooklyn announced Wednesday that six federal 
employees had taken bribes from contractors on renovation and repair 
jobs in federal buildings, including some payoffs received in the 
halls of the courthouse where the case will now be tried. ``Who knows 
what accounts for the brazenness,'' said Zachary Carter, the U.S. 
attorney in Brooklyn. Carter said that a two-year undercover investigation 
had found that dozens of the illegal payoffs _ some of them secretly 
recorded by the authorities _ were made in elevators, hallways, the 
boiler room and other areas of the U.S. District Courthouse in downtown 
Brooklyn. But Carter said he was not surprised to learn that graft 
had invaded the building where he and his staff also work. ``I don't 
think the federal courthouse is immune,'' he said at a news conference 
in his office, in a building near the courthouse. ``It could happen 
anywhere.'' Carter also announced the arrests of the federal employees 
and 10 private contractors charged with paying or offering them the 
bribes. In what officials said was the largest corruption prosecution 
in the history of the General Services Administration _ the agency 
responsible for the buildings that federal courts and agencies occupy 
_ one veteran GSA supervisor, Patrick McCosker, was said to have received 
about $100,000 in bribes for helping contractors gain renovation and 
maintenance jobs at the courthouse. The five other agency supervisors, 
who like McCosker had the title of assistant building manager, were 
described in court papers as having received relatively small amounts 
_ ``several thousand dollars'' or, in one case, $6,000. But one investigator, 
who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that for some of the 
defendants, ``these are conservative estimates'' and that the continuing 
investigation was expected to find that those defendants had pocketed 
far more. All together, investigators said, the payoffs helped the 
contractors obtain millions of dollars' worth of jobs. The assistant 
U.S. attorney handling the case, Leslie Cornfeld, said the agency 
supervisors' salaries ranged from $45,000 to $63,000 a year. Besides 
the courthouse, the other buildings involved in what the authorities 
called ``widespread bribery and kickback schemes'' are privately owned 
structures, where the major tenants are federal agencies. The agency 
supervisors were not operating together but were rather engaged in 
separate schemes at various times between 1993 and 1997, Carter said. 
He said that sometimes the agency employees took the initiative in 
soliciting bribes and kickbacks and that sometimes the contractors 
did. He said the investigation leading to the charges announced Wednesday 
began when a contractor, whom he would not identify, reported to the 
federal agency's management that one of its employees ``may have solicited 
bribes.'' The investigation that followed, he said, employed confidential 
informers whom he did not identify but who appear to have included 
at least one employee of a contractor company and one agency employee. 
The agency supervisors charged in the case, who were arrested Wednesday 
and charged in criminal complaints, are all longtime employees of 
the agency, with service ranging from 10 years to 23 years. The 10 
contractors are affiliated with companies that do construction and 
renovation, or that specialize in areas like mechanical and electrical 
systems, doors and locks, and carpet care. All six federal employees 
and three of the contractors were arraigned Wednesday in the same 
Brooklyn courthouse at the center of the alleged corruption, and all 
were released on $100,000 bonds pending further court action. They 
were not required to enter pleas at the arraignment, and none did. 
Their lawyers declined to comment as they and their clients left the 
courthouse.
