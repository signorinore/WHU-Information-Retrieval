A co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and WBGH Boston. It's 
Wednesday, October 7th. I'm Tony Kahn. Today, Russia's unpaid workers 
take to the streets demanding President Yeltsin resign. Meanwhile, 
some analysts are resigned to Russia having more arms than smarts. 
Russia is cursed with having nuclear weapons because as a result of 
having these weapons, they can get away with doing stupid things on 
the economic front. On the diplomatic front, Secretary of State Albright 
says the ground work has been laid for a successful Middle East summit 
and Afghanistan's Taliban offers the U.N. a drug deal. First, this 
news. From National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm Corey Flintoff.
