As the House prepares to vote on whether to launch an impeachment 
inquiry, a senior Senate Democrat is blasting what he calls the rabid 
attacks and partisan tactics that surround the Starr Report. West 
Virginia Democrat Robert Byrd says both parties are to blame. NPR's 
Peter Kenyan reports. A 46-year veteran in Congress, Robert Byrd is 
the Senate's outspoken defender of the Constitution and legislative 
tradition. Byrd has been offended by what he calls the "attack dogs 
on both sides who appear on talk shows offering rabid and wild attacks," 
that Byrd says have no place in such a solemn constitutional proceeding. 
His criticism isn't limited to Republicans. Reports that the White 
House is contacting lawmakers prior to tomorrow's House vote prompted 
him to remind his Senate colleagues that they will be jurors should 
impeachment articles come over from the House. And I would suggest 
by way of friendly advice to the White House: Don't tamper with this 
jury. A number of House Democrats are expected to vote for the GOP 
inquiry resolution despite their reservations about the process. Peter 
Kenyan, NPR News, the Capitol.
