officials I preparation for what may be the next big bail out of a 
failing economy. IMF officials had little to say about the talks, 
but an official at Brazil's finance ministry said Brazil is discussing 
fiscal reforms that it would have to make before winning approval 
for IMF loans. Brazil has been losing hundreds of millions of dollars 
a day in foreign investment, has been in serious worry about it's 
large government deficit and the weakness of the Brazilian currency, 
the Rayal. Analysts say that if Brazil topples into recession, it 
could dry up on important export market for the United States.
