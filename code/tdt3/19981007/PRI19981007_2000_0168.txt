Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says that despite the global 
turmoil that's battered emerging economies in roiled U.S. financial 
markets, the U.S. economy continues to have significant momentum. 
NPR's John Ydstic reports. During a speech in Washington, Greenspan 
said when you look at the physical economy as opposed to the financial 
markets, there is still very little impact from the contagion that 
has spread from Asia. Greenspan added the U.S. economy is still quite 
an impressive sight, but he said the prospects for growth have significantly 
weakened. He said because of the meltdown in foreign markets, investors 
have fled to safety. So far, that has not created a credit crunch 
in the U.S., the chairman said, but the decline in U.S. stock markets 
as investors have fled risk have subtracted about $1.5 trillion dollars 
in wealth from U.S. households. That will rein in demand going forward 
to an unknown extent, said the chairman. His comments led to concerns 
about U.S. corporate profits which weighed down the stock market today.
