The federal government is suing the nation's two biggest credit card 
networks accusing them of smothering competition. Attorney General 
Janet Reno said both Visa and MasterCard are controlled by the same 
set of banks and that rules adopted by both credit card networks prohibit 
member banks from offering competing cards. Reno said American consumers 
have lost the benefit of vigorous competition between the two largest 
credit card networks. Between them, Visa and MasterCard control about 
75 percent of the nation's credit card business.
