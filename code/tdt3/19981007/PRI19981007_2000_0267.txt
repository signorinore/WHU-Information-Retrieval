The Food and Drug Administration is warning people with implanted 
medical devices to be wary of metal detectors. The agency says it's 
received a few reports of metal detectors interfering with pacemakers, 
heart defribilators, and other devices. NPR's Dan Charles reports. 
Metal detectors and the gates that stores sometimes use to stop shoplifters 
produce magnetic fields. Twice in recent years, they set off heart 
defibrilators which deliver a shock that makes the heart beat properly. 
About a dozen people have problems with their spinal cord stimulators 
which control chronic pain. In other cases, pacemakers were affected 
but the problems were mild and temporary. The FDA says it's not a 
big problem. There have been only a handful of these reports and nobody's 
been seriously hurt. Most problems occurred when people leaned against 
a metal detector or when handheld detectors got right next to an implanted 
device. The FDA says people with these devices shouldn't be afraid 
of metal detectors, just don't linger too close to them. Dan Charles, 
NPR News, Washington.
