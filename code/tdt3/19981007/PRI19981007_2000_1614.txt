The man who moves markets does it again. I'm Richard Griffis at the 
New York Business Desk. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan rattled Wall Street 
today after giving his clearest indication yet that the U.S. economy 
has weakened considerably in the face of the financial crisis overseas. 
Mr. Greenspan, who's being criticized for not going far enough in 
cutting interest rates last week said the economy is still enjoying 
continued momentum, but questions remain about future growth. Today, 
the economy has remained in reasonable shape with good growth and 
low, if not declining, inflation as a crucial element with respect 
to the existing state of affairs. But we are clearly facing a set 
of forces that should be dampening demand going forward to an unknown 
extent.
