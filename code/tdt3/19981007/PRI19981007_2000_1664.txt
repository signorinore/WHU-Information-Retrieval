More signs of the global contagion spreading come from China today, 
where the Central Bank says it's taking responsibility for the debts 
of a major investment firm that's closed down. The collapse of the 
Gwang Dong International Trust, which channeled foreign investment 
is seen as highlighting the vulnerability of those Chinese financial 
firms which have borrowed from abroad. That economic crisis overseas 
may be generating all sorts of fears for corporate earnings here, 
but one American exporter, the copier manufacturer Xerox, says its 
bottom line is being hit less from the down turn than other high tech 
firms. Xerox concedes it can't be sure what next year may bring, but 
for now, it sells to Asia and Latin America that remains relatively 
unscathed. That's our look at Wednesday's business. More from us at 
the same time tomorrow. For THE WORLD, I'm Richard Griffis in New 
York.
