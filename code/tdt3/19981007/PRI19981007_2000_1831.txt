Last ditch talks aimed at solving the Kosovo crisis between American 
envoy Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic have 
ended abruptly. Mr. Holbrooke will now brief Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright and NATO officials in Brussells. Jackie Rowland reports from 
Belgrade on the deadlock talks. Belgrade continues to insist it has 
complied with the United Nations Security Council demands on Kosovo. 
The West is equally adamant it hasn't. Diplomats said there were a 
number of unresolved questions including the issue of withdrawing 
special police units from Kosovo. But some Serbian officials say they 
still hope to avert military intervention. Ordinary people don't seem 
to share their opinion. Popular feeling is that NATO has staked its 
credibility on the threat of air strikes making them inevitable. The 
contact group on Yugoslavia will meet in London tomorrow to discuss 
the outcome of Mr. Holbrooke's mission to Belgrade.
