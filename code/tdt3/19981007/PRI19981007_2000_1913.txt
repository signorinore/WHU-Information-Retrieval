Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has confirmed plans for a Middle 
East peace summit in Washington next Thursday. Speaking after meeting 
with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders, she said she found a new 
spirit of cooperation and a sense of urgency. Leese Doucet reports 
from Jerusalem. Even Mrs. Albright expressed surprise over the results 
and tone of today's meeting. She said significant and substantial 
progress had been made in several areas ranging from the hardest issues, 
Palestinian security and Israel's troop redeployment, to more specific 
matters such as an industrialist state and an airport in Gaza under 
Palestinian control. But she cautioned tough decisions still had to 
be made by Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat if a deal was to be reached 
in Washington this month. Leese Doucet, BBC, Jerusalem. President 
Clinton said he was going to be personally involved involved in next 
Thursday's Washington summit.
