The federal government has filed a lawsuit against two of the biggest 
credit card networks - MasterCard and Visa. Washington claims the 
two are limiting competition. The lawsuit alleges the two groups acted 
illegally by not allowing banks in issuing MasterCard or Visa to do 
business with smaller competing card networks such as American Express.
