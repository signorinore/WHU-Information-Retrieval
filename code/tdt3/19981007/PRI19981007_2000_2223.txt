Hot and spicy. Those are your first clues to today's geography quiz. 
Today's mystery spot is a state in southern Mexico between Chapis 
and the Pacific Ocean. Home to the country's largest population of 
Mexican Indians, this region is known for its handicrafts and its 
cuisine. The capital city which shares the name of the state was founded 
five centuries ago as an Aztec garrison. One of its main museums and 
stores, the Magic Hand, attracts tourists and art fanciers from around 
the world. You can also feel the presence of that magic hand in the 
regional cooking. We'll describe an example and cook up the answer 
to today's geography quiz in a few minutes.
