A British official met Thursday with President B.J. Habibie and praised 
him for releasing political prisoners and planning a democratic election. 
British Deputy Foreign Minister Derek John Fatchett also discussed 
with Habibie the brutal effect that the Asian financial crisis is 
having on Indonesia's economy. ``I offered the United Kingdom's assistance 
toward the process of developing its free and fair election,'' Fatchett 
said after meeting with Habibie and his foreign minister, Ali Alatas. 
Fatchett did not elaborate, but Alatas said Britain is willing to 
supply the kind of technical assistance that the United Nations Development 
Program will provide during the election next year. Fatchett, who 
arrived in Jakarta Wednesday for a two-day visit as the personal emissary 
of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, praised Habibie for releasing 
dozens of political prisoners. ``I welcome the changes that have taken 
place since May in Indonesia _ the release of political prisoners, 
the movement toward election, and the great freedom that exists,'' 
Fatchett said. Habibie took power after Suharto, Indonesia's authoritarian 
president, resigned May 21 in the face of widespread and violent pro-democracy 
protests. Habibie promised greater democratic freedoms for Indonesians, 
and scheduled a general election in May 1999 under new, more democratic 
electoral laws. Fatchett said Britain will continue to be a partner 
with Indonesia in economic development. ``I told President Habibie 
that British business people will be visiting Indonesia next month,'' 
he said.
