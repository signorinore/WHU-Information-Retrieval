Cabinet hard-liners on Thursday threatened to topple Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu if he makes concessions to the Palestinians at 
a Mideast summit in Washington next week. Opponents of an Israeli 
troop pullback in the West Bank have enough seats in the 120-member 
parliament to strip Netanyahu's coalition of its majority and force 
new elections. However, by ousting Netanyahu, the hard-liners would 
risk bringing a more dovish government to power and it was not clear 
whether they would go through with their threats. The most vehement 
opponent of a troop withdrawal is the National Religious Party, which 
represents the Jewish settlement movement in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip and has nine seats in parliament. Netanyahu was to meet later 
Thursday with NRP leaders. Transport Minister Shaul Yahalom of the 
NRP demanded that Netanyahu coordinate his negotiating positions with 
the party before the Oct. 15 summit in Washington. ``Together, we 
will determine the red lines,'' Yahalom told Israel radio. ``If he 
(Netanyahu) returns from the United States having his positions eroded, 
the NRP cannot be a partner (in the government).'' NRP legislator 
Hanan Porat said that if Netanyahu concludes an agreement on a troop 
withdrawal, he will set in motion preparations for early elections. 
Porat is chairman of parliament's Law Committee and has the power 
to determine the fate of an opposition bill to disperse parliament 
and hold early elections. The bill passed a preliminary reading before 
parliament went into summer recess. Porat told Israel TV that he would 
set a date for a first reading of the bill should Netanyahu return 
from Washington with an agreement on a troop pullback. Parliament 
begins its winter session Oct. 19. The new threats by hard-liners 
in Netanyahu's coalition came after the prime minister held three-way 
talks Wednesday in Gaza with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Albright said after the 
meeting that substantial progress was made and that she hoped the 
remaining issues could be resolved in the Washington summit. U.S. 
President Bill Clinton said he would dedicate considerable time to 
the negotiations, raising fears among Israel's far-right politicians 
that Netanyahu would come under intense U.S. pressure to make concessions. 
On the table is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli pullback from 13 percent 
of the West Bank, in exchange for a blueprint for a Palestinian crackdown 
on Islamic militants. Netanyahu on Thursday briefed his so-called 
``kitchen Cabinet'' _ Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, Infrastructures 
Minister Ariel Sharon and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky _ on the 
talks with Albright and Arafat. The three ministers are expected to 
accompany Netanyahu to Washington.
