Russia's customs service confiscated five military helicopters being 
shipped to North Korea without the governments's permission, a news 
agency reported Thursday. The state-run armaments company Rosvooruzheniye 
said Thursday it had nothing to do with the shipment, the ITAR-Tass 
news agency said. The company said the Mi-8T helicopters were seized 
Wednesday at the Khasan checkpoint, on Russia's border with North 
Korea, after customs agents found they were being delivered without 
government authorization. According to ITAR-Tass, a private Russian 
company that owned the helicopters, declared their value at dlrs 20,000 
each, far below the market price. The choppers had pods to carry weapons, 
the report said. Large quantities of military equipment have fallen 
into private hands since the Soviet collapse. The Soviet Union provided 
economic and military aid to North Korea, but Moscow cut back bilateral 
ties since the Soviet collapse.
