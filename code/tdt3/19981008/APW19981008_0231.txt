Hong Kong share prices rallied Thursday, boosted largely by a surge 
in property stocks while investors shrugged off a plunge in Tokyo's 
stock market. Investors snapped up property shares in reaction to 
low interest rates and to government policies introduced Wednesday 
to help the property industry, traders said. The Hang Seng Index gained 
194.79 points, or 2.5 percent, closing at 7,939.51. The index had 
climbed 2.4 percent Wednesday. The Hang Seng property sub-index surged 
710.04 points, or 8.3 percent, closing at 9,248.86. Other sub-indices 
were far more subdued, with the financial sub-index up just 22.84 
points at 9,981.98. Trading grew to 5.84 billion Hong Kong dollars 
(U.S. dlrs 748 million) from 3.81 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. 
dlrs 488 million) Wednesday. ``The star was just the property shares,'' 
said Francis Wu at South China Securities Ltd. Hong Kong Chief Executive 
Tung Chee-hwa's pledge Wednesday to stabilize the property market 
and to be flexible about his goals for housing construction over the 
next few years helped boost property shares, traders said. Fairly 
low local interbank interest rates are giving some hope that rates 
will fall later in the year, said Samson Chau, sales director at BNP 
Prime Peregrine Asia Ltd. ``The whole market gained because the yen 
strengthened and pressure on (China's yuan) and the Hong Kong dollar 
peg will be less,'' said Chong Leong, an analyst at Morgan Stanley 
Asia Ltd. ``Speculation on a further rate cut, which will weaken the 
U.S. dollar, will alleviate pressure on the Hong Kong dollar and the 
(yuan),'' he said. Among property shares, New World Development Co. 
gained 1.05 Hong Kong dollars to 11.75, Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. 
rose 2.80 to 37.60 and Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. rose 3.20 to 31.60. 
Market heavyweight HSBC Holdings shed 1.50, closing at 136.50, while 
its affiliate Hang Seng Bank gained 2.15 to 51.25. HSBC is being hurt 
by worldwide fears of a banking crisis, said BNP's Chau. Meanwhile, 
shares in Guangdong Investment plunged 11 Hong Kong cents to 1.36 
following the shutdown of its parent, which was overburdened with 
debt, by the People's Bank of China on Tuesday.
