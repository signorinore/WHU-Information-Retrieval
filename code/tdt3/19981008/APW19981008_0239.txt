France on Thursday asked the U.N. Special Commission to convene a 
meeting with chemical weapons experts to determine the results of 
tests on Iraqi warheads. The request came a day after news reports 
that French experts had detected traces of nerve gas on Iraqi warheads, 
but that France had withheld the findings because it didn't want to 
undermine Baghdad's attempts to get U.N. sanctions lifted. The French 
Foreign Ministry said it wasn't aware of the findings. But on Thursday, 
it issued a statement requesting that the Special Commission hold 
a meeting at the United Nations in the next few days, to permit Security 
Council members ``to appreciate the scientific methods used by the 
three chosen laboratories (in France, Switzerland and the United States) 
and the results obtained, and the scientific conclusions to be drawn.'' 
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said the request came 
``out of concern for clarification and the information of the Security 
Council members.'' The New York Times reported Wednesday that testing 
on samples from the weapons show evidence of chemicals linked to VX, 
a drop of which on the skin, or inhaled, can kill an adult within 
minutes. The newspaper cited unidentified weapons experts. Iraq, which 
has been the subject of seven years of U.N. weapons inspections, has 
admitted it tried to make VX but denied it was ever able to make enough, 
or stabilize it sufficiently to load into weapons. U.N. arms experts 
must certify that Iraq has destroyed its chemical, biological and 
nuclear weapons _ and the long-range missiles to deliver them _ before 
the Security Council will lift crippling sanctions imposed after Iraq 
invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf War. Swiss tests on warheads 
turned up negative. But a U.S. Army laboratory concluded that missile 
fragments contained traces of the gas. Weapons experts told the Times 
that the French findings would confirm the American tests.
