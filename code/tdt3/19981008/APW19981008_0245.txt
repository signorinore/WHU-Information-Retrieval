Convoys of U.S. and other foreign embassy staff and their families 
rolled out of Belgrade Thursday, while Washington tried to rally support 
for airstrikes unless Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic bowed 
to international demands for peace in Kosovo. The international pressure 
was expected to intensify following three days of meetings between 
Milosevic and special U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke. The U.S. envoy 
was to brief Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and NATO officials 
Thursday in Brussels, Belgium, on the results of those talks. Holbrooke 
refused to talk to reporters after his final session with Milosevic 
on Wednesday. But Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency said Milosevic warned 
that threats of NATO airstrikes only dim the chances for peace in 
Kosovo. Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, met Milosevic on Thursday 
en route to London for a meeting of the so-called Contact Group countries: 
the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and Italy. Russia 
strongly opposes the use of force to resolve the crisis, and Ivanov 
is expected to deliver that message when he meets Albright in London. 
In Shanghai, China, however, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said 
Milosevic was engaging in ``brinksmanship'' because he ``has not been 
given a strong enough message.'' ``I hope the international community 
lives up to its responsibility to send President Milosevic a united 
and strong message that we won't tolerate the atrocities carrying 
on,'' Blair said.
