A boat carrying 141 people sank in a lake in northeastern Spain Thursday, 
and at least seven French tourists died, an emergency services official 
said. The boat carrying tourists from La Rochelle, France, sank at 
10:45 a.m. (0845 GMT) in the Lake Banyoles near the city of Girona. 
It was not yet known what caused the boat to sink, said a spokeswoman 
for the local emergency services, who did not give her name according 
to custom.
