Switzerland's experimental drug-distribution program is set to be 
extended after Swiss lawmakers on Thursday gave the go-ahead for doctors 
to prescribe heroin to long-term addicts on a permanent basis. The 
upper house of parliament approved the measure by 30 votes to four, 
following approval yesterday by the lower house. The move is expected 
to increase from 800 to some 2,000 or more the number of addicts who 
can receive controlled distribution. It comes into effect Saturday. 
Until now, the daily supply of nominally priced heroin to addicts 
who had rejected all forms of therapy was on an experimental basis. 
On Wednesday, Interior Minister Ruth Dreifuss told lawmakers that 
passing the measure to extend the program could help save lives. Some 
150 addicts are on the waiting list, she said.
