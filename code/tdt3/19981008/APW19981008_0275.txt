A Somali faction leader who heads the new, self-styled Puntland autonomous 
state in northeastern Somalia says regionalization is the way to a 
unified, peaceful Somalia. ``The Somali national reconciliation process, 
which was based mainly on a top-down approach has totally failed, 
and all efforts of eight years of talks between faction leaders under 
the auspices of the international community have failed,'' Col. Abdullahi 
Yusuf Ahmed told a news conference in the Ethiopian capital Wednesday. 
Somalia has not had a central government since 1991 when Gen. Mohamed 
Farah Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed joined forces to oust longtime President 
Mohamed Siad Barre. They then turned on each other, unleashing a civil 
war that fueled a devastating famine. Since then, the Horn of Africa 
nation of an estimated 9.3 million people has been divided into clan-based 
fiefdoms run by warlords. Abdullahi Yusuf said the only viable option 
to remake Somalia was to create autonomous regional states that would 
eventually form a federal administration. The late Aidid's son, Hussein 
Mohamed Aidid, opposes the federal option and, along with Ali Mahdi, 
is the leading proponent of recreating the unitary state through a 
national reconciliation conference. But the latest conference in the 
central town of Baidoa has been postponed at least three times since 
most of the faction leaders backed this option after month-long peace 
talks in Cairo last December. Abdullahi Yusuf did not endorse the 
Cairo agreement and set up Puntland in July, over the objections of 
other faction leaders in the region. ``Major developments have taken 
place in Somalia since the Cairo agreement was signed, and the new 
concept which has emerged is to form autonomous regional states which 
in turn would establish a central federal system,'' Abdullahi Yusuf 
said. He insisted that he is not seeking independence for Puntland 
nor secession from Somalia. He said he envisioned five regional states 
in Somalia, based on five of Somalia's six major clans. In 1991, Mohamed 
Ibrahim Egal set up the breakway state of Somaliland in northwestern 
Somalia but has failed to gain international recognition. And Siad 
Barre's son-in-law, Gen. Mohamed Hersi, better known as ``Morgan,'' 
said recently he was going to set up an autonomous Jubaland state 
in southern Somalia with the port of Kismayo as its capital. Ethiopia 
has consolidated relations with portions of Somalia and the warlords 
running them, including the northwest and the northeast. Morgan is 
also a frequent visitor to Addis Ababa. Aidid, who retains ties with 
Egypt, claims Ethiopia is arming his opponents.
