Shares on the Amsterdam Bourse took another beating Thursday as traders 
reacted nervously to the weakening dollar and losses on other exchanges, 
particularly Tokyo. At 0855 GMT, the 27-share AEX-index was down 28 
points, or 3.3 percent, to 829.11 points. The Tokyo bourse closed 
a sharp 5.8 percent lower Thursday, while the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average also closed overnight slightly down at 7741.69 points. The 
dollar dipped to its lowest level against the Dutch guilder since 
January 1997, trading at 1.795 in Amsterdam. The Dutch bourse is highly 
sensitive to the strength of the U.S. currency as a number of index 
companies derive much of their overseas revenues in dollars.
