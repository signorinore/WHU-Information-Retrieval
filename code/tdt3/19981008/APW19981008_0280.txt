The speaker of parliament on Thursday suggested holding a referendum 
on whether President Boris Yeltsin should resign, but the proposal 
appears to violate Russian law. ``It would be legitimate to hold such 
a referendum,'' said Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who serves as 
speaker of the lower house, the State Duma. His remarks were reported 
by the Interfax news agency. However, Russian law specifically states 
that there may not be a referendum on the early termination of a president's 
term. Seleznyov added that Yeltsin should consider resigning voluntarily 
following nationwide protests on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Yeltsin reiterated 
his intention to serve out his full term. During a meeting with senior 
military and security officers, he said he would maintain personal 
control over the military. ``And it will be like that, at least, until 
the year 2000, while I'm here,'' Yeltsin said, according to Russian 
news agencies. Wednesday's demonstrations were held mainly to protest 
the country's economic woes. Many of the demonstrators also called 
for the resignation of Yeltsin, who still has two years left in his 
term. The government on Wednesday evening estimated that 615,000 people 
took part in street demonstrations in nearly 500 cities, but raised 
the estimate to 1.3 million on Thursday. By either count, the turnout 
was far below the expectations of Communists who organized the protest 
together with trade unions. Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov forecast 
that up to 40 million would take part. Yeltsin, who is 67 and has 
had serious health problems, has said he won't run again. The most 
likely candidates include Zyuganov, regional governor Alexander Lebed, 
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and liberal lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky. 
Seleznyov said Thursday that he may also consider running, provided 
he has popular support.
