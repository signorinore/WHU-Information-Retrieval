Thailand's air force will phase out hundreds of officers who have 
no clear assignments and dismiss those found to have suspicious backgrounds, 
air force officials said Thursday. Of the 3,098 captains and colonels 
in the air force, about one-third either have no duties or are in 
what are called inactive posts. The phase-outs will start in January. 
Officers who are suspected of wrongdoing are frequently transferred 
to an inactive post as punishment. Jintana Thianmanee of the air force 
public relations division said the force will try find work for some 
officers to do so they don't lose their jobs.
