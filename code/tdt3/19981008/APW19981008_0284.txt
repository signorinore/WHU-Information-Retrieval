Russia's nuclear ministry isn't expecting any more federal money for 
cleaning up contamination from weapons production, so it is planning 
to seek outside help, the top nuclear official said Thursday. Atomic 
Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov also insisted that Russia has no plans 
to develop new types of nuclear arms, the Interfax news agency reported. 
In a meeting with environmentalists, Adamov said the ministry would 
try to raise funds to clean up contaminated areas because it wasn't 
counting on the next federal budget to include any money for cleanup. 
He also discussed burying radioactive waste, reactor safety and nuclear 
proliferation, Interfax said. Russia's nuclear weapons plants and 
power plants dumped tons of radioactive waste into rivers and lakes 
over several decades. Cleanup has been slow because it is difficult 
and costly.
