India's Bandit Queen will be the star attraction of an international 
conference on caste and persecuted people in the Malaysian capital 
this weekend. Phoolan Devi, a former Indian federal lawmaker who once 
spread terror riding horseback with a rifle slung on her shoulder, 
will speak about her experiences at the conference on ``A New Vision 
Toward a Casteless Society,'' an organizer said. At sessions Saturday 
and Sunday, about 650 delegates from the United States, Britain, Canada, 
Australia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and India will discuss problems 
faced by persecuted people worldwide. The conference is being organized 
by the Indian Progressive Front and The Dalit International Organization, 
both Malaysian-based groups. ``The Indian apartheid is worse than 
the the African apartheid,'' said M.G. Pandithan, head of the front. 
Devi, 36, has portrayed her criminal career as part of a struggle 
between low-caste Hindus like herself and the upper castes. She was 
born to a poor farmer whose land was stolen by upper-caste men. Her 
father sold her into marriage at age 11 to a man who brutalized her. 
She ran away from her husband and fell in love with a highway robber, 
who was killed by upper-caste men. She formed her own gang of bandits 
and is alleged to have massacred upper-caste men. She denies it. She 
was released in 1994 after 11 years in prison, and won an election 
in 1996. She lost her seat in parliament earlier this year. During 
her campaign in one of the most backward regions of India, she used 
her life story to appeal for votes. Upper-caste men fired shots at 
her motorcade, blocked her with burning tires and organized demonstrations 
by widows of the men that her gang allegedly murdered. ``She is a 
source of inspiration for other women who think men are superior to 
them,'' said Pandithan.
