Three ethnic Albanians in Kosovo were sentenced Thursday to up to 
four years in prison for attempting to join the rebels fighting for 
independence for the province. The Serbian court in Gnjilane, some 
30 kilometers (18 miles) southeast of the capital Pristina, said the 
three were guilty of anti-state activities and terrorism, the Tanjug 
news agency reported. The agency said one of the convicted ethnic 
Albanians is a minor and would serve his two-year sentence in the 
prison for juvenile delinquents. The other two were sentenced to three 
and a half and four-year terms. Tanjug said they were arrested last 
August ``during attempt to join the Kosovo Liberation Army.'' Hundreds 
of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are awaiting trial on similar charges.
