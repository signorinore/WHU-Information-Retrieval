At least 19 French tourists died Thursday when an excursion boat carrying 
141 people went down in a lake in northeastern Spain, emergency services 
said. The reasons why the boat sank at 10.45 a.m. (0845GMT) in the 
Lake Banyoles 350 miles northeast of Madrid were not yet known, said 
Monica Estefania, a spokeswoman for the local emergency services. 
Thirteen people died in the water, and six people died once they had 
been taken to local hospitals, Estefania said. Initial reports indicated 
that most of the passengers were retired French tourists from La Rochelle, 
Estefania said. Lake Banyoles is the largest lake in the northeastern 
region of Catalonia. The boat was on the point of setting off on a 
trip around the lake when it sank, the national news agency EFE said.
