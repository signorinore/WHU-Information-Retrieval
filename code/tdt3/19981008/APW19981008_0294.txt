The chairman of Kazakstan's parliament claimed Thursday that President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev had agreed to early presidential elections next 
year, though Nazarbayev has shot down the proposal before, news reports 
said. The claim by Parliament Chairman Marat Ospanov came just before 
Kazakstan's parliament passed a resolution Thursday setting early 
presidential elections for Jan. 10, 1999, the Interfax news agency 
reported. Nazarbayev was to comment on the move later Thursday, according 
to his press service. But just last month he said he would not step 
down before his term expires in 2000. The parliament resolution cannot 
be implemented without Nazarbayev's consent. Parliament leaders want 
to move the elections forward by a year so they do not coincide with 
the 2000 presidential vote in Russia, the reports said. Meanwhile, 
the lower house of parliament, or Mazhilis, approved a list of constitutional 
amendments earlier submitted by Nazarbayev that allow political parties 
to expand their limited role before the next legislative elections 
are held in December 1999, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. The amendments 
include increasing the number of seats in the Mazhilis, to 77 from 
67, extending parliamentary term limits, allowing candidates to indicate 
their political affiliation on the ballots and dropping the requirement 
for a 50 percent voter turnout to validate elections.
