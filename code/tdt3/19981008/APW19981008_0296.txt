Palestinian security agents summoned Hamas leaders and warned them 
not to carry out terror attacks in Israel at a time when an agreement 
on a West Bank troop pullback is close, a Hamas official said Thursday. 
Such warnings were delivered to leading Islamic militants throughout 
the West Bank, said a senior Palestinian security official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity. One meeting took place on Wednesday afternoon 
in the office of Col. Munir Abousheh, the head of the Preventive Security 
Service in the West Bank town of Nablus. Abousheh told 12 Hamas leaders, 
including Jamal Salim of Nablus, that Palestinian Authority President 
Yasser Arafat was close to agreement with Israel on a West Bank troop 
withdrawal, according to a Hamas participant who spoke on condition 
of anonymity. Abousheh complained that whenever progress was made 
in peace talks, Hamas was carrying out bombings in hopes of sabotaging 
the agreements. The colonel told the Hamas leaders that the Palestinian 
Authority would not tolerate any more terror attacks. He also said 
the group was being closely watched and that the Palestinian Authority 
had learned that Hamas leaders abroad were urging activists in the 
West Bank to try to kill Palestinian Authority officials. Last week, 
Hamas leaders in the Gaza Strip were given similar warnings after 
Palestinian security caught two Hamas activists carrying several dozen 
pounds of explosives near the border with Israel, apparently en route 
to carrying out a bombing. Hamas is responsible for more than a dozen 
suicide bombings in Israel since 1994. Last month, the group vowed 
there would be more bombings to avenge the killing of two Hamas fugitives 
by Israeli troops. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said 
Wednesday that Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
made substantial progress toward agreement on a West Bank troop withdrawal. 
The two leaders will try to wrap up a deal during a Washington summit 
that is to begin Oct. 15.
