Police in northwest Poland have detained a German man suspected of 
abducting and sexually abusing a 3-year-old girl, a police spokesman 
said Thursday. The man, identified as Heinz Dieter K., 40, of Lengerich, 
was detained Wednesday night near Goleniow, 500 kilometers (300 miles) 
northwest of Warsaw, with the child in his car, said police spokesman 
Krzysztof Rusinowicz. Witnesses who saw a stranger lead the girl away 
from her home in the nearby town of Swinoujscie remembered the vehicle's 
license plate number and alerted police, according to Rusinowicz. 
A hospital examination showed the girl had been sexually abused, Rusinowicz 
said. The suspect, an unemployed married man with two children, could 
face charges of abduction and sexual abuse of a minor, which carry 
a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, Rusinowicz added.
