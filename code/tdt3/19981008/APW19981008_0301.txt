Searching for a medieval solution to a modern problem, the leaders 
of a southern Russian town are planning to sell indulgences. Local 
authorities in Belgorod are promising limited legal immunity to anyone 
who helps finance a new road. Traffic volume in Belgorod has increased

long underway, it has stalled because of funding shortages.
