Iranian forces clashed with Afghanistan's Taliban militia Thursday 
on Iran's northeastern border, Iranian media reported. But the Taliban 
denied any clash occurred. Taliban forces attacked Iranian border 
posts in northeastern Khorasan province with mortars and machine guns 
early Thursday and Iranian border guards returned fire, forcing Taliban 
fighters to retreat, Iranian television said. The Taliban suffered 
heavy casualties during the three hour clash and three of the militia's 
border posts were destroyed, Brig. Gen. Azizollah Jaafari, commander 
of the ground forces of Iran's elite Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, 
said. His remarks were carried by the official Islamic Republic News 
Agency. ``The situation in the area is currently calm,'' Jaafari said. 
There were no immediate reports of any Iranian casualties. The clash 
occurred at 6.30 a.m. (0300 GMT) in Torbat-e Jam in the Saleh Abad 
region. The area is about 180 kilometers (110 miles) southeast of 
the Iranian city of Mashhad. ``The attack was confronted with responses 
by the forces stationed at our country's border posts, and as a result 
the Taliban forces were forced to ... retreat,'' the television reported, 
quoting an army statement. But Shakeel, a Taliban spokesman who uses 
only one name, said no clash had taken place. ``We received this information 
and we checked from our people and it is wrong,'' he said. Contacted 
at the Taliban headquarters in southern Kandahar, Shakeel said, ``There 
is no truth in this report and it is propaganda against the Taliban.'' 
Tensions between Iran and the Taliban have been high since the militia, 
which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, admitted that its fighters 
killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist in northern Afghanistan 
in August. Iran has demanded an apology from the Taliban and wants 
the culprits handed over for trial in Tehran. Taliban leaders have 
refused both demands, calling the diplomats ``conspirators.'' It also 
has accused Iran of arming and financing its northern-based opposition, 
which includes the country's minority Shiite Muslims. Most Iranians 
also are Shiite Muslims. The Taliban is made up largely of ethnic 
Pashtuns, who are mostly Sunni Muslims. Iran has massed more than 
200,000 troops on its eastern border with Afghanistan and has conducted 
several large-scale military exercises during the past few weeks. 
Afghanistan's Taliban army has sent an estimated 10,000 troops to 
its western border with Iran. Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi 
said Wednesday that Tehran wants a peaceful settlement with the Taliban, 
but warned that his country was running out of patience.
