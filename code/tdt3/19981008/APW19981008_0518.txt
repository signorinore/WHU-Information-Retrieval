The government Thursday approved the use of 16 Air Force F-16 fighter 
planes in possible NATO airstrikes, removing the last hurdle to Dutch 
participation in the Kosovo crisis. Prime Minister Wim Kok's coalition 
had already told NATO the fighters and a refueling plane would be 
made available. Thursday's approval _ given after a special Cabinet 
meeting _ formalized that decision. NATO is preparing to strike at 
strategic Serb targets if diplomatic efforts fail to force Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to end his crackdown against ethnic Albanian 
secessionists in Kosovo. Hundreds of people have been killed in the 
province and more than 270,000 driven from their homes since Milosevic 
launched his offensive in late February.
