An excursion boat carrying 141 people sank in a lake in northeastern 
Spain, and at least 20 French tourists died, an emergency services 
official said. The boat sank at 10:45 a.m. (0845 GMT) in Lake Banyoles 
near the city of Girona, 350 miles (560 kilometers) northeast of Madrid, 
said Monica Estefania, a spokeswoman for the local emergency services. 
It was not yet known what caused the boat to sink, she said. With 
weather clear and the lake water apparently calm, the vessel was just 
setting off on a trip around the lake when it sank, news reports said. 
As marine and firefighting units scoured the water and the wreckage 
of the boat for more bodies, the French consulate in the nearby regional 
captial of Barcelona said their reports indicated more than 40 people 
were being treated in hospital while over 70 were uninjured in the 
accident. National television images showed bodies covered in blankets 
lining the small pier at the lake. Other shots showed bodies being 
pulled out of the water into small rowing boats. The injured were 
reported to have been taken to Josepa Trueta hospital in the nearby 
city of Girona. French Consul General in Barcelona Pierre Charasse 
went immediately to Banyoles to help coordinate the rescue operation 
and deal with survivors and relatives. Thirteen people drowned in 
the water, and seven people died after being taken to local hospitals, 
Estefania, the rescue services spokeswoman, said. ``The problem is 
that the passengers are old folk and that makes it difficult for them 
to swim ashore,'' a spokesman for the La Carpa firm that owned the 
vessel told the national news agency Efe. The agency cited eyewitnesses 
as saying the boat split in two in waters described as being between 
two and 15 meters (yards) deep. The electrically-powered vessel, launched 
earlier this year, made some 50 trips daily on the lake, the La Carpa 
spokesman, who was not identified, told Efe. Initial reports indicated 
that most of the passengers were retired French tourists from La Rochelle 
and were staying at the seaside resort town of Lloret de Mar. Lake 
Banyoles, is 2 kilometers (1.5 miles) long and is up to 700 meters 
(765 yards) wide at one point, is the largest natural lake in the 
northeastern region of Catalonia and was used for several water events 
in the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics.
