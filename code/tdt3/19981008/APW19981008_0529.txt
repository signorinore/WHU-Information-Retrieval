There are a few more trees in Athens, some stretches of smooth sidewalk, 
a car-free shopping zone and one quite comfortable mayor. Dimitris 
Avramopoulos, a former diplomat now running city hall, has built a 
wide base of support by doing what his predecessors could not: appear 
to tame Greece's unruly capital. Now there's another giant challenge. 
The powerful Socialist party wants him out. The outcome of the mayoral 
race _ part of nationwide municipal elections on Sunday _ is being 
closely watched as a possible bellwether for even bigger stakes in 
the future. The expected Avramopoulos victory could be his final stepping 
stone to a shot at the leadership of the main opposition New Democracy 
party. New Democracy, which has been in power only three of the past 
17 years, is presently led by the less charismatic Costas Caramanlis. 
But an upset victory by challenger Maria Damanaki, of the governing 
Socialist party, could prove a crippling blow to Avramopoulos' image, 
turning him from potential savior to pariah among conservatives. ``In 
these four years, Athens has begun to regain its lost appearance, 
to obtain an identity, to strengthen its international authority, 
to undertake initiatives, to be more clean,'' Avramopoulos as he campaigned 
for a second four-year term under the slogan ``The Battle for Athens.'' 
Ms. Damanaki, a well-known political activist, says Avramopoulos is 
trying to turn Athens into ``Disneyland,'' and his politics lack true 
depth. Avramopoulos ignores ``the wounds of the capital,'' Ms. Damanaki 
cried at a rally in central Athens. Ms. Damanaki has canvassed far-flung 
neighborhoods and made rounds of speeches. But she's yet to confront 
Avramopoulos face to face. The mayor has chosen to make no public 
campaign appearances and has erected only a few banners. A massive 
sign in Athens' main square promises to give the homeless the money 
saved by not campaigning. In the homestretch, Avramopoulos seems unstoppable. 
Some voter polls give him a more than 3-to-1 edge over Ms. Damanaki, 
who first emerged as the voice of the student uprising against the 
1967-74 military dictatorship. The poll figures also offer a possible 
lesson to other politicians in Greece, where scant attention has been 
paid to quality-of-life issues in the frenzy to modernize. Athens 
has grown five-fold in the past 30 years _ mushrooming from a cozy 
city around the Acropolis to a smog-choked metropolis that is home 
to half the country's 10.2 million people. Across the country in the 
900 mayoral and 187 other local government elections Sunday, the outcome 
will serve as a litmus test for Premier Costas Simitis' harsh austerity 
policies aimed at getting Greece into the European Union single currency 
group by 2001. Conservatives have waged strong mayoral campaigns in 
key cities such as Pireaus and could unseat Socialist incumbents. 
But Simitis has weathered the brunt of anti-belt tightening protests 
so far and the Socialists still seem capable of easily winning national 
elections in 2000. This could set up a chance for Avramopoulos to 
grab the opposition leadership and challenge the Socialists in 2004, 
when Athens hosts the summer Olympic Games. Avramopoulos refuses to 
publicly discuss his long-range political goals, preferring instead 
to concentrate on pushing visible changes. He created a new flag for 
the city, hired municipal police with bright uniforms, built nearly 
20 water fountains, planted trees and replaced nearly 95,000 square 
meters (342,000 square feet) of sidewalk. A pedestrian shopping district 
opened this year and plans are also under way to build garages to 
alleviate the city's chronic traffic problems. He has erected Europe's 
tallest Christmas ``tree'' _ actually strings of lights attached to 
a pole _ and hosted hundreds of cultural events. But critics accuse 
him attempting to make cosmetic changes without first dealing with 
the underlying problems of a city grown too big too fast. ``Surely 
the changes are impressive,'' said Athens historian Sarantos Kargakos. 
``They remind me of the ornaments we put on graves in cemeteries ... 
the real Athens is sinking and this mayor is preparing an appropriate 
funeral.''
