BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO's chief military commander in Europe 
said Thursday the alliance was still leaving Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic a window of opportunity to change his mind and withdraw 
troops from Kosovo to avoid airstrikes. In an intense round of talks, 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, NATO Secretary Javier 
Solana, special U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Supreme Allied Commander 
Wesley K. Clark, were in Brussels to asses the chances of a peaceful 
solution to the Kosovo crisis. NATO's military officials have repeatedly 
said it is ready to launch an airstrike as soon as it gets the green 
light. In the meantime the alliance kept looking Thursday for a belated 
change of mind on Milosevic's part. ``This is a period in which we 
are still assessing compliance, and President Milosevic is obviously 
making up his mind whether he is going to fully comply,'' said Clark. 
Albright sent Holbrooke back to Belgrade Thursday and the envoy canceled 
a meeting with the NATO council. NATO has said that troop and special 
police levels in Yugoslavia's Kosovo's province had decreased from 
36,000 10 days ago to some 25,000 by Wednesday, but such levels were 
still unacceptable. There was also evidence many were hunkering down 
for the winter. If there is no swift and irreversible change in the 
pace of withdrawal, NATO officials said, airstrikes will become inevitable. 
By Thursday noon, NATO had had no new reports on withdrawals, said 
a NATO official, who demanded anonymity. NATO has been preparing plans 
for months to launch airstrikes and is now awaiting member approval 
to put them into operation. ``All plans are still ready to go,'' said 
Clark. Solana has stressed the 16-nation Alliance did not need the 
backing from the United Nations to launch air strikes against Yugoslavia 
and had enough legal backing for such an operation.
