A training camp that was once used as a base for Kurdish rebels in 
eastern Lebanon is now nothing but a barn, residents and news reports 
said Thursday. Turkey contends that Kurdish Turkish rebels of Abdullah 
Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers' Party (or PKK) have training camps here 
and also accuses Syria of aiding the Kurds. It has sent troops to 
its border with Syria to press its case, prompting fears of a military 
confrontation. Syria denies the charge. Turkish news reports have 
speculated that Ankara could attack alleged Kuridsh bases in Lebanon's 
Syrian-controlled eastern Bekaa Valley. Residents of the Bekaa villages 
of Yanta and Halwa, about four kilometers (2.5 miles) from the Syrian 
border on the northern foothills of Mount Hermon, said Thursday that 
there had been no sign of Kurdish rebel presence in the area for several 
years. The villagers, all speaking on condition of anonymity, did 
not rule out that the Kurds moved elsewhere in the barren mountains 
of Anti-Lebanon that form the border with Syria. A reporter for the 
leading An-Nahar newspaper who managed to visit the camp said outgrown 
weeds were the only sign of life there. A portrait of Ocalan lay covered 
with dust. Part of the camp has been turned into a barn used for cattle, 
said the An-Nahar report Thursday. Another report in the same paper 
said Ocalan was last seen at the camp in 1992 when he spoke to reporters 
and took part in a Kurdish folk dance as he clutched an automatic 
rifle. The camp, which at its peak graduated up to 400 fighters every 
four months, has since been abandoned and the Lebanese army used it 
briefly, An-Nahar said. Villagers said Palestinians of the radical 
Syrian-backed Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General 
Command were at one point seen in the area after the Kurds had left. 
On Monday, Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said Lebanon and 
Syria took measures more than 1 1/2 years ago to stop the activities 
of Ocalan's PKK.
