Union leaders indicated Thursday that across-the-board wage cuts and 
a 50 percent reduction in the amount of money employers and workers 
pay into government-controlled pension funds could be in the cards 
for Singaporeans. The aim is reduce wage costs 15 to 20 percent, government 
television quoted union leaders as saying. Lim Boon Heng, head of 
the National Trades Union Council and a member of the Cabinet, said 
that a 10 percentage point cut in the amount of money employers are 
required to pay into their workers' Central Provident Fund pension 
accounts would save dlrs 4 billion. Employees now pay 20 percent of 
their wages into the government-managed funds, and the employers match 
that amount. Under discussion is a proposal to cut both contributions 
by half. No firm announcements were made. But in line with Singapore 
tradition, officials made comments intended to prepare workers for 
changes. They are expected at the end of October, when a national 
committee on competitiveness makes a report on how the country of 
3.2 million can weather the regional economic crisis. Singapore's 
unions cooperate with the government and businesses. Hawazi Daipi, 
director of international affairs for the union council, said on government 
television that workers who had questioned the policy of ``wage restraint,'' 
adopted earlier this year, now agree that the only way to save jobs 
is to accept cuts in wages and pension fund contributions. ``A package 
of wage sacrifices is needed to save jobs in the economic downturn, 
to contribute to Singapore's overall competitiveness,'' government 
television quoted the union officials as saying.
