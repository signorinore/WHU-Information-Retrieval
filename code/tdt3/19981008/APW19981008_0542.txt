President Leonid Kuchma criticized Thursday the central bank's efforts 
to overcome Ukraine's growing financial crisis and said the government 
would soon consider possible changes to its monetary policies. Kuchma 
said the Cabinet and the National Bank must come up with new measures 
to support the national hryvna currency when a government delegation 
returns from talks with the International Monetary Fund on Friday. 
The delegation, led by Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko, was in 
Washington to participate in the annual meeting of the IMF and the 
World Bank. Ukraine, whose economy suffered following the 1991 collapse 
of the Soviet Union, was dealt a new blow recently by the economic 
crisis in neighboring Russia, its main trading partner. The crisis 
has hurt Ukrainian exports, led to a withdrawal of investors and caused 
the hryvna to lose more than 50 percent of its value in September 
alone. The hryvna, which traded at about 2.1 to the U.S. dollar before 
the crisis hit in mid-August, slipped to 3.4 on Wednesday, nearly 
breaching the lower limit of a government-set trading band. Many analysts 
believe the hryvna is being artificially supported by regulations 
forcing exporters to sell half of their foreign currency earnings 
on the currency exchange. Some recently predicted the hryvna is bound 
to fall as low as 6 to the dollar, which led Ukrainians to start stocking 
up on food, clothing and household goods. Many commercial banks have 
also complained that the National Bank was not selling them all the 
dollars they wanted. Kuchma said the National Bank's pre-crisis policy 
of spending reserves to support the hryvna was ``not far-sighted.'' 
``Many people wanted to show that Ukraine's hryvna could be more stable 
than the U.S. dollar or Japanese yen,'' Kuchma told a meeting of regional 
authorities. Kuchma said the government should think of new anti-crisis 
steps, given the sharp devaluation of the hryvna and payment problems 
many Ukrainian enterprises have encountered because of the crisis. 
He suggested a decrease in government spending and less of the foreign 
borrowing to which the government has resorted in recent years to 
finance the budget deficit. Kuchma said Ukraine owes dlrs 10.24 billion 
to its foreign creditors, including dlrs 2.4 billion for natural gas 
from Turkmenistan and Russia.
