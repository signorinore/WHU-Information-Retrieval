A civic group representing South Korean women forced into sexual slavery 
by the Japanese military during World War II rejected Japan's latest 
apology Thursday. The apology was contained in an agreement signed 
in Tokyo by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and Japanese Prime 
Minister Keizo Obuchi. While the agreement apologized for Japan's 
35-year colonial rule of South Korea, it didn't satisfy the Korean 
Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan. 
``We are seriously disappointed, because the joint announcement doesn't 
even mention the issue of comfort women,'' the council said in a statement. 
Comfort women is a euphemistic term for hundreds of thousands of Asian 
women forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers at front-line 
brothels during World War II. ``The Japanese government has apologized 
several times, and it was all lip service,'' the statement said. ``An 
apology without government compensation is not a true apology.'' Activist 
groups want the Japanese government to compensate the former sex slaves. 
Japan set up the private Asia Women's Fund in 1995 to dole out financial 
assistance to the women. But the fund's offer of dlrs 17,000 to each 
surviving victim was rejected by most South Koreans, who demand that 
any compensation come directly from the Japanese government. South 
Korea was a colony of Japan from 1910 to 1945. Historians estimate 
that as many as 200,000 women from Korea and other Asian nations were 
taken to Japanese army brothels during World War II. Some 150 South 
Koreans are registered as former sex slaves.
