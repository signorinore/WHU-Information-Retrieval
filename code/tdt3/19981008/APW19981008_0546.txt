Germany's Greens party, which is about to enter the national government, 
argued publicly Thursday about conditions for NATO strikes in Serbia's 
Kosovo province. The rift between pragmatists and pacifists in the 
small party presents the first major test for Chancellor-elect Gerhard 
Schroeder, who meets U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington on 
Friday. Greens defense expert Angelika Beer demanded a clear U.N. 
mandate for German warplanes to take part in any airstrikes. ``We 
want to keep NATO from giving itself a mandate,'' she told the Flensburger 
Tageblatt newspaper. Germany faces ``enormous international pressure'' 
to take part in an attack, but the priority should be to join with 
Russia in stepping up diplomatic pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic, she said. Another Greens lawmaker, Helmut Lippelt, took 
a tougher approach. Warning of a looming ``humanitarian disaster'' 
in Kosovo, he urged the party to take a stand now that they're getting 
into government. ``We have to avoid a split vote as in earlier times, 
when we debated until midnight,'' he said. Joschka Fischer, the leading 
Greens moderate and probably Germany's new foreign minister, has avoided 
commenting on Kosovo in recent days. He was joining Schroeder on the 
visit to Washington. Schroeder has said he wants a new U.N. mandate 
for NATO strikes in Kosovo, but he has left open the possibility that 
Germany would take part under the existing mandate if the crisis worsens. 
Schroeder, a Social Democrat, invited the Greens to join his government 
as junior partner after his victory in Sept. 27 elections.
