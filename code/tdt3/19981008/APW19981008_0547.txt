An excursion boat carrying 141 people sank Thursday in a tranquil 
lake in northeastern Spain, killing at least 20 people, most believed 
to be French retirees. Thirteen people drowned in the water, and seven 
people died after being taken to local hospitals, said Monica Estefania, 
a spokeswoman for the local emergency services. It was not immediately 
known how many people were hospitalized. ``The problem is that the 
passengers are old folk and that makes it difficult for them to swim 
ashore,'' a spokesman for the vessel's owners, La Carpa, told the 
national news agency Efe. As rescuers units scoured the water and 
the wreckage for more bodies, the French consulate in nearby Barcelona 
said more than 40 people were hospitalized. Another 70 people escaped 
without injury. National television images showed bodies covered in 
blankets lining the small pier at the lake. Other shots showed bodies 
being pulled into small rowing boats. The boat sank Thursday morning 
under clear skies and in calm waters as it set off to circle Lake 
Banyoles, just north of Barcelona and some 350 miles (565 kilometers) 
northeast of Madrid, Efe said. The agency cited eyewitnesses as saying 
the boat split in two. The vessel, launched earlier this year, made 
50 trips daily on the lake, the La Carpa spokesman, who was not identified, 
told Efe. Initial reports indicated that most of the passengers were 
retired French tourists from La Rochelle and were staying at the seaside 
resort town of Lloret de Mar. Lake Banyoles, is 2 kilometers (1.5 
miles) long and is up to 700 meters (765 yards) wide at one point, 
is the largest natural lake in the northeastern region of Catalonia 
and was used for several water events in the 1992 Barcelona Summer 
Olympics.
