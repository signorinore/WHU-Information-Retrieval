There were plenty of news in Israel, as usual _ a record dollar rate, 
Mideast summit plans. But outrage over Israeli soccer star Eyal Berkovic 
getting kicked in the jaw by a West Ham team mate relegated everything 
else to the sidelines Thursday. The Maariv daily's front-page was 
covered by a photo of Berkovic kneeling and cringing in pain as West 
Ham player John Hartson's left foot struck his jaw. ``The scream of 
pain,'' read the Maariv caption. ``It's shocking to see such a thing, 
especially if it's your own son,'' said Berkovic' father, Zeev. ``At 
first I felt Hartson should be prosecuted, but Eyal decided not to 
complain to the police. He wasn't so badly hurt. He's alright now, 
and that's the main thing for me,'' Berkovic told The Associated Press. 
The Israeli national team gave Berkovic a warm welcome as he arrived 
in San Marino for a game that pitches Israel against the tiny European 
nation in a qualifying round for the European Championships. Angriest 
was Israeli midfielder Haim Revivo. ``Hartson is lucky he didn't do 
it to me,'' Revivo told the Haaretz daily. ``He wouldn't be playing 
football by now. Believe me.'' Israeli media quoted Berkovic was saying 
he would not submit a complaint to the police against Hartson. ``Believe 
me he would go to jail, but I don't want a player from my team sent 
to prison,'' Haaretz quoted Berkovic as saying. The Israeli player 
accused West Ham of trying to cover up the incident and said he would 
have to consider whether to remain with the club. However, he rejected 
Hartson's claim that he was merely using the incident as a pretext 
for leaving the English club, Haaretz said. Berkovic told the daily 
he would return to West Ham as soon as the San Marino event was over. 
The English Football Association has asked West Ham for the video 
tape with a view to studying it and considering measures against Hartson. 
West Ham reportedly prefers to settle the issue internally on the 
grounds that the incident occurred in training, not in a match.
