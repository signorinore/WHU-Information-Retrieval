Any large devaluation of Vietnam's dong currency should be considered 
only as a short-term measure because it would do harm in the long 
run, the newspaper Investment said Thursday. The paper cited a roughly 
6.5 percent devaluation in August, taken by the government to spur 
exports and curb imports. But it put more pressure on inflation and 
some local industries, while creating a heavy burden on dollar-denominated 
debts. Vietnam has devalued the dong by about 20 percent since March 
1997, less that the steep falls in the currencies of other Asian countries, 
thereby cutting the country's competitive edge. Vietnam's export revenue 
has increased by only 4.1 percent in the first nine months and is 
expected to reach dlrs 9.3 billion by the end of the year, equivalent 
to 1997's figure. The country's exports had maintained annual growth 
of about 25 percent since the early 1990s. Any major devaluation also 
would hit some 3 million people on the state payroll and pensioners.
