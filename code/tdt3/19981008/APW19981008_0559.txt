The international effort to rid the world of polio early in the new 
millennium may fail unless governments give it a fresh injection of 
cash, the World Health Organization has warned. Independent experts 
have told the WHO an extra dlrs 600-700 million is needed until the 
end of 2000 to keep immunization and surveillance programs going, 
according to a press release issued Thursday. ``The eradication campaign 
may be running critically short of funding and we ask donors and governments 
to go the extra mile with us,'' the release quotes WHO Director-General 
Gro Harlem Brundtland as saying. Failure is not acceptable, the former 
Norwegian premier added. ``This is a combat we simply cannot afford 
to lose.'' Wild polio has been eradicated from the Western Hemisphere 
since 1991 and most of Europe and the Western Pacific also is polio-free. 
Polio cases have dropped by nearly 90 percent since the campaign began 
10 years ago. But doctors still are fighting to stamp out the virus 
in the Indian sub-continent and sub-Saharan Africa, where war and 
poverty have hindered vaccination attempts. All children, even in 
polio-free countries like the United States, must continue to be vaccinated 
until the virus is wiped out worldwide, because infected travelers 
can spread it.
