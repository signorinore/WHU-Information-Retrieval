The secretary_general of the Arab League has been hospitalized in 
Brussels, suffering from severe exhaustion during a trip to the European 
Union headquarters, officials said Thursday. Esmat Abdel-Meguid, 75, 
had a heavy schedule in New York and in the Belgian capital, which 
led to fatigue, league spokesman Talaat Hamid said. A spokeswoman 
for the Egyptian Embassy in Brussels said Abdel-Meguid is in stable 
condition and will leave the hospital to return to Cairo in a few 
days. ``The doctors have decided to keep him under observation,'' 
said the spokeswoman, who did not want to be named. She said Abdel-Meguid 
arrived from the United States ``very tired.'' Abdel-Meguid, a veteran 
Egyptian diplomat, served as foreign minister before he was chosen 
as the league's head in 1990.
