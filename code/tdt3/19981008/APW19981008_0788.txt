At least 15 iguanas went on an island-hopping Caribbean cruise on 
a mat of logs, showing that land animals can migrate between islands 
through such accidental voyages, researchers reported today. The iguanas 
apparently traveled about 150 miles (240 kilometers) from Guadeloupe 
to Anguilla after Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn blew through the region 
in September 1995. There had been a few previous accounts of backboned 
animals found on natural rafts but no convincing evidence that the 
voyagers could start a new population when they reach land, researchers 
said. But the iguanas that reached Anguilla in October 1995 included 
males and females, and since then they've appeared to be healthy, 
the researchers said. The animals are green iguanas, a species that 
hadn't lived on the island, Ellen Censky of the Carnegie Museum of 
Natural History in Pittsburgh and other scientists report in today's 
issue of the journal Nature. Local fishermen reported seeing the animals 
on the beach and on logs in the bay after the huge raft washed up 
on Anguilla, the report said. The researchers concluded the animals 
came from Guadaleloupe because of the location of previous green iguana 
populations, the tracks of the hurricanes and the direction of ocean 
currents. The researchers captured eight of the animals between December 
1995 and last March. Three others were spotted on nearby Scrub Island 
and more were reported on the northeast coast of Barbuda, about 90 
miles (140 kilometers) southeast of Anguilla, the researchers said. 
The new report is ``a spectacular observation,'' James H. Brown, an 
ecologist and biogeographer at the University of New Mexico, told 
The New York Times. ``Some of the things nature can do are pretty 
incredible.''
