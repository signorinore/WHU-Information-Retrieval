Fifth-seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov and defending champion Greg Rusedski 
toppled out in second round play of the Swiss Indoors, further depleting 
the dwindling pool of seeded players. The two players join world No. 
1 Pete Sampras and world No. 2 Patrick Rafter as early round casualties, 
leaving just two seeded players in Basel midway through the second 
round. Rusedski was toppled 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 by German qualifier David 
Prinosil, bringing the defence of his crown to an abrupt halt, while 
Kafelnikov was upset 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 by Sweden's Magnus Gustafsson. 
In an apocalyptic first round, the tournment's top three seeds and 
the three Grand Slam champions present crashed out, leaving the draw 
sadly diminished. Tournament organisers watched in horror as Wimbledon 
champion Sampras, U.S. Open champion Rafter and Australian Open titlist 
Petr Korda, seeded third, all exited the tournament within 24 hours 
of each other. ``I have a lot of company,'' shrugged Rusedski. ``There 
have been a lot of upsets. I guess it's not good to be a seed this 
week.'' The lanky British power-server showed signs of weakness from 
the start, narrowly saving two break points at 3-2 to remain on serve. 
But Rusedski was immediately broken on ihis next serve, sending a 
fierce backhand into the net, and allowing Prinosil to jump ahead 
4-3. The Briton broke back at 5-6 to avoid surrendering the set, but 
then lost the tiebreak. The two players traded serves early in the 
second set, before the German qualifier used a pair of match points 
at 6-5 to clinch the win. Kafelnikov, ranked 10th in the world and 
12th on the ``Road to Hannover'' standings, was hoping to use the 
tournament as a springboard into the top eight rankings in order to 
earn a berth at the ATP Tour World Championship next month. The Russian 
got off to a strong start in the first set, breaking Gustafsson to 
jump ahead 3-1, but then appeared to yield control of the match. Gustafsson 
broke early in the second set, then held onto his lead to even the 
score. In the final set, the two held serve until 5-5, when Gustafsson 
used two break points to seal the match. The devastation leaves American 
Andre Agassi, seeded fourth, and sixth-seed Tim Henman of Britain 
as the only remaining seeds. Agassi played Swiss qualifier Ivo Heuberger 
in second round play later Thursday, while Henman was scheduled to 
meet Morocco's Hicham Arazi. Boris Becker, always a top-draw, also 
made an early exit, eliminated in the first round. The semi-retired 
veteran said he was pulling out of Vienna next week, and offered his 
wildcard to Sampras, who'd been disappointed Austrian organizers had 
no room left for him after his elimination.
