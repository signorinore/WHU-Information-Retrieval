Russia is already factoring into its fourth-quarter budget dlrs 2.4 
billion in international loans, despite signs that lenders are reluctant 
to hand over the money, the finance minister said Thursday. Mikhail 
Zadornov also said the budget to go to parliament next week forecasts 
another sharp drop in the ruble rate, which has plummeted since the 
currency was devalued in August. Zadornov and other Russian officials 
tried and failed to win a new loan installment from the International 
Monetary Fund during a visit to Washington this week. Zadornov said 
the IMF won't issue the funds until Russia takes a definitive stab 
at overcoming its current troubles. The Russian government has yet 
to finalize a plan to tackle the economic crisis _ even though the 
country desperately needs the foreign aid to help pay its many debts. 
Wage and pension arrears sparked a day of nationwide protests Wednesday. 
The talks in Washington showed that lenders' attitude to Russia is 
``very wary,'' Zadornov said, according to the Interfax news agency. 
``They expect practical steps first,'' he said. ``If these steps help 
to stabilize the situation and are based on free-market instruments, 
then they will receive understanding and support.'' The IMF helped 
arrange a dlrs 22.6 billion international loan package for Russia 
in July, but had disbursed only dlrs 4.7 billion before the crisis 
hit in August and froze further installments. Zadornov said he and 
the IMF discussed the fourth-quarter budget in detail and focused 
on one that includes dlrs 2.4 billion in as-yet-undisbursed loans. 
Without that money, Russia would have to print money to cover its 
shortfalls, which the IMF has strongly opposed. The budget will foresee 
a ruble rate of 20 to 23 to the dollar, or 4.3 to 5 cents. That was 
much lower than Thursday's rate, which fell slightly to 16.2 to the 
dollar, or about 6.2 cents, from 15.8 to the dollar Wednesday, or 
6.3 cents. The government said Thursday it would send a draft fourth-quarter 
budget to parliament on Oct. 14 or 15. It said it would announce an 
economic program before Oct. 20. The only sign of a crisis-attacking 
plan from Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government so far has 
been a draft published by the Russian media last week that called 
for a number of Soviet-style administrative controls. Primakov, however, 
insists he supports continued market reforms. Primakov reiterated 
in a Cabinet session Thursday that the top priority is to pay overdue 
wages and pensions. ``We must draw lessons from (Wednesday's protests), 
since the people have mostly been driven by the dissatisfaction with 
economic conditions,'' Primakov said. The Cabinet discussed a plan 
to reduce the debts of Russian companies, which have piled up in recent 
years to a staggering 1.2 trillion rubles (dlrs 75 billion), or about 
40 percent of the country's gross domestic product, Russian media 
said.
