Iran said its forces on the border fought a three-hour gunbattle Thursday 
with the Taliban militia, inflicting heavy casualties, but the Taliban 
denied any fighting occurred. Early Thursday, Taliban forces attacked 
Iranian border posts in northeastern Khorasan province with mortars 
and machine guns and Iranian border guards returned fire, forcing 
Taliban fighters to retreat, Iranian television said. The Taliban 
suffered heavy casualties during the three-hour clash and three of 
the militia's border posts were destroyed, Brig. Gen. Azizollah Jaafari, 
commander of the ground forces of Iran's elite Islamic Revolution 
Guards Corps, told the official Islamic Republic News Agency. He did 
not report any Iranian casualties. ``The situation in the area is 
currently calm,'' Jaafari said. But Shakeel, a Taliban spokesman who 
uses only one name, said no clash had taken place, and branded the 
Iranian report as propaganda against Taliban. ``We received this information 
and we checked from our people and it is wrong,'' he said when contacted 
at the Taliban headquarters in southern Kandahar. Tensions between 
Iran and the Taliban have been high since the militia, which controls 
90 percent of Afghanistan, admitted that its fighters killed eight 
Iranian diplomats and a journalist in northern Afghanistan in August. 
The Taliban religious militia, made up largely of Sunni Muslims, has 
accused Iran's Shiite clerical regime of arming and financing its 
northern-based opposition, which includes the country's minority Shiite 
Muslims. Thursday's reported clash occurred Thursday morning in Torbat-e 
Jam in the Saleh Abad region. The area is about 180 kilometers (110 
miles) southeast of the Iranian city of Mashhad. ``The attack was 
confronted with responses by the forces stationed at our country's 
border posts, and as a result the Taliban forces were forced to ... 
retreat,'' the television reported, quoting an army statement. Another 
Taliban spokesman, Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, said the Iranians have 
fired artillery into Afghanistan during the past three days. But Taliban 
leader Mullah Omar ordered his border commanders to ``show restraint 
and not retaliate,'' Muttawakil said when contacted by telephone from 
neighboring Pakistan. Iran wants an apology from the Taliban for the 
August slaying of its citizens and wants the culprits handed over 
for trial in Tehran. Taliban leaders have refused both demands, calling 
the diplomats ``conspirators.'' Iran has massed more than 200,000 
troops on its eastern border with Afghanistan and has conducted several 
large-scale military exercises during the past few weeks. Afghanistan's 
Taliban army has sent an estimated 10,000 troops to its western border 
with Iran. Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said Wednesday 
that Tehran wants a peaceful settlement with the Taliban, but warned 
that his country was running out of patience.
