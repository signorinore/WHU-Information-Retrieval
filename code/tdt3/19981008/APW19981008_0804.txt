Tiger Woods experienced his first Dunhill Cup team golf championship 
Thursday and took a swipe at the attitudes that surround the high-pressure, 
nerve-wracking Ryder Cup. ``You don't get the boos, the hissing and 
the moaning that you get at the Ryder Cup,'' said Woods, who has teamed 
up with Mark O'Meara and John Daly as the United States trio in this 
1 million pound (dlrs 1.67 million) 16-nation championship. ``The 
fans here are more appreciative. There are a lot of good golfing fans 
out here. It's just a completely different environment. It's not life 
or death. ``When the Ryder Cup started out it was a friendly match 
_ now it's not like that any more,'' Woods said after his 6-under 
66 at the home of golf overwhelmed England's David Carter by eight 
strokes. ``This tournament is not the same and that's one of the good 
things about it. The guys go out and play head to head and it's fun.'' 
Woods, who was on the United States Ryder Cup 12 beaten by Europe 
at Valderrama last year, recalled how the match was spoiled by the 
huge buildup of hype which effectively kept the rival players away 
from each other. ``These guys on the European side, I know them. Some 
are good friends of mine,'' he said. ``Unfortunately I wasn't able 
to spend time with my friends. ``We were told that Marbella was a 
great city. We really wouldn't know. We drove by it. We saw the hotel, 
the golf course and that's it.'' Mark O'Meara, the American team captain 
here, has repeatedly hit out at the hype that surrounds the Ryder 
Cup and also at the lack of time the players are allowed to spend 
to together off the course. ``Everyone needs to lighten up a little 
bit,'' said O'Meara who has played four Ryder Cups. ``It's a very 
nerve-wracking situation. ``It's a tremendous honor to represent your 
country and I'm not denying that the Ryder Cup has become a special 
event.'' ``But sometimes you win, sometimes you lose and, when I lose, 
I don't think I'm a failure because of that,'' said O'Meara, winner 
of this year's Masters and British Open. ``There is always tomorrow. 
``There are a lot more countries represented here and more atmosphere 
here,'' O'Meara said. ``It's very competitive but more gentlemany 
out here.''
