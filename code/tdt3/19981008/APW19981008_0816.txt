Four men convicted of murder were publicly executed in Yemen, the 
daily Al-Thawra reported Thursday. Mohammed Qasim al-Shami and Ahmed 
Ali al-Shami were shot to death by firing squad in the southern province 
of Ibb on Tuesday after they were convicted of murdering Finda Zaid 
al-Shami, the Arabic-language paper said. The three men were from 
the same tribe and were involved in dispute over an inheritance claim. 
It was not immediately known if they were related but many members 
of one tribe often have the same last name. The victim's family, court 
officials and a crowd of onlookers witnessed the execution in a public 
square, Al-Thawra said. It said the other two executions occurred 
Sunday: Saeed Saleh Ahmed was shot to death, also in Ibb, for the 
murder of Saleh Saeed Hamadi; Qaed Hussein Sharafi was executed in 
the western province of Heja for killing Shadad Ali Abdullah. There 
was no explanation why the executions were reported Thursday. Yemen, 
an impoverished country at the tip of the Arabian Peninsula, imposes 
the death penalty for rape and murder. Most executions are carried 
out in public to set an example and are usually carried out by firing 
squad.
