Prices on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange closed sharply lower Thursday, 
as a nervous market was dragged down by a weakening dollar and losses 
on key international bourses, particularly Tokyo. The 27-share AEX-index 
closed down 29.44 points, or 3.4 percent, at 827.67 points, but slightly 
up from its lowest level of 807.83 points earlier today. Most major 
European bourses suffered losses Thursday, partially due to the Tokyo 
exchange closing lower earlier in the day. But the overriding negative 
influence for Dutch traders came from the sharp worldwide slide of 
the dollar. In Amsterdam, the U.S. currency, at 1455 GMT, stood at 
1.81 guilders, down from 1.82 guilders late Wednesday. Earlier in 
the session, the dollar fell as low as 1.79, the first time since 
June 1997 that it had fallen below the 1.80-guilder mark. The Dutch 
stock market is highly dollar-sensitive, as a number of index companies 
derive much of their overseas revenues in dollars.
