Canada, the Netherlands and Greece were in a hotly contested campaign 
Thursday to win two of the nonpermanent seats on the Security Council, 
the most powerful decision-making organ of the United Nations. The 
three countries were competing for two seats allotted to the regional 
group of Western Europe and other nations on the 15-member council 
for the next two years, replacing Portugal and Sweden, whose terms 
expire. The council, effectivly the U.N. board of directors, has 10 
nonpermanent seats and five permanent ones: the United States, Britain, 
China, France and Russia. Every year, five of the nonpermanent seats 
go up for election by a secret ballot before the 185-member General 
Assembly. The ballots were being counted Thursday morning. In addition 
to the two contested seats, three other seats being vacated went uncontested: 
Malaysia, representing Asia, Namibia for Africa and Argentina representing 
Latin America. They will replace Kenya, Costa Rica and Japan. The 
nonpermanent members Bahrain, Brazil, Gabon, Gambia and Slovenia will 
be replaced next year. The campaign for the two seats in the Western 
Europe group caught some attention over the summer after Greece invited 
U.N. delegates for a weeklong Aegean cruise. Greece denied the trip 
_ dubbed by some diplomats a ``blue water pitch'' to get votes _ was 
related to the council bid. Canada and the Netherlands as well did 
some heavy campaigning, with the former inviting delegates to a performance 
of Canada's ``Cirque du Soleil'' and the latter staging its own moonlit 
cruise, albeit down New York's East River. On Tuesday, Greece made 
a final bid to join the council, arguing that it was only fair that 
Greece be allowed to assume one of the nonpermanent seats up for grabs 
this year. The Greek deputy foreign minister, Yannos Kranidiotis, 
told reporters that Greece's strategic position, the fact that it 
has only been on the council once before, and its record of contributing 
both money and resources to the United Nations makes it the perfect 
candidate. Greece was on the council in 1952-53. Canada has held the 
seat five times, most recently in 1989-90, and the Netherlands on 
four previous occasions, the last one being 1983-84. Canada and the 
Netherlands were believed to have had the better shots at landing 
the seats because of the dispute over Cyprus, the Mediterranean island 
divided between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Having Greece on the council 
could further politicize the issue at the United Nations. Others cited 
the prominent Dutch and Canadian presence on peacekeeping forces as 
well as the continued Dutch influence over its former colonies who 
voted Thursday.
