After unsuccessfully opposing new legislatures for Scotland and Wales, 
the opposition Conservative Party should consider proposing a separate 
Parliament for England, party leader William Hague said Thursday. 
Hague's suggestion, made only in the broadest terms in a speech to 
the party's annual conference, marked a sharp departure for a party 
that has always defended the integrity of the United Kingdom. In effect, 
he accepted that Prime Minister Tony Blair's government had changed 
the political landscape after a year in power, and that Conservatives 
would have to deal with new realities. After winning a landslide victory 
over the Conservatives last year, Blair moved quickly to establish 
legislatures in Scotland and Wales, and promoted a peace agreement 
that gave Northern Ireland a new assembly. All three of those legislatures 
will be limited to dealing with specific domestic matters, while defense 
and foreign relations will be controlled by the Parliament in London. 
However, Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish lawmakers will continue 
to vote on purely domestic matters involving England, by far the largest 
part of the United Kingdom. ``We are not going to be English nationalists, 
but we are going to see that the voters of England are fairly represented,'' 
Hague said. ``For the first time, we will have to become the advocates 
of major constitutional change, he said, adding ``it may be an English 
Parliament in some form.'' There are calculations of self-interest 
for both Labor and Conservatives in a possible English Parliament. 
So long as the Parliament in London is drawn from the whole United 
Kingdom, it is that much harder for Conservatives to regain power. 
They won no seats in Scotland or Wales in 1997 and, like Labor, made 
no serious effort to win seats in Northern Ireland. Through 18 years 
of Conservative government from 1979 to 1997, the party's position 
was secured by its dominance in England, while the other parts of 
the United Kingdom remained opposition strongholds. Hague said Conservatives 
would strongly oppose Labor's apparent intention to adopt some form 
of proportional voting. Conservatives fear that such a system would 
keep them permanently out of power, and saddle the country with a 
succession of coalition governments. ``If you want to know what is 
at stake, just look at New Zealand,'' Hague said. ``They agandoned 
our system in favor of (proportional representation). And they ended 
up with two parties who swore they would never work with each other. 
In other words, the one government that not a single voter had wanted.'' 
Though opinion polls have shown no signs of a Conservative resurgence 
from the depths of their defeat last year, Hague predicted that the 
party would regain control of some local councils in elections next 
year, and then would fight for seats in the Welsh and Scottish legislatures. 
``We are not going to leave the battleground to nationalist parties 
who want to destroy our country and a Labor Party which has played 
into their hands,'' Hague said.
