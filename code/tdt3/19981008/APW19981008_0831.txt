Canada and the Netherlands beat out Greece on Thursday in a hotly 
contested campaign for two of the nonpermanent seats on the Security 
Council, the most powerful decision-making organ of the United Nations. 
The two countries will represent the regional group of Western Europe 
and North America on the 15-member council for the next two years, 
replacing Portugal and Sweden, whose two-year terms expired. The council, 
effectively the U.N. board of directors, has 10 nonpermanent seats 
and five permanent ones: the United States, Britain, China, France 
and Russia. Every year, five of the nonpermanent seats go up for election 
by a secret ballot before the 185-member General Assembly. In addition 
to the two contested seats, three other seats went uncontested in 
Thursday's vote: Malaysia, representing Asia, Namibia for Africa and 
Argentina representing Latin America.
