Sudanese rebels burned down the huts and villages of countrymen living 
in exile in northeastern Congo, and forced them to return home, aid 
officials said Thursday. World Vision said 8,000 Sudanese had trekked 
in the past week from Congo to southern Sudan, where a 15-year civil 
war is being fought. Sudanese rebels on Saturday told 41,000 refugees 
in camps near Dungu, Congo to go home, then ransacked U.N. refugee 
offices in Dungu and Doruma, where radios and vehicles were stolen, 
agency said. ``The security of refugee camps must be respected and 
refugees themselves allowed to decide when it is safe to return home,'' 
Dennis McNamara, a UNHCR director, said in Geneva. The United Nations 
withdrew its staff from northeastern Congo when fighting broke out 
Aug. 2 between the Congolese government and rebellious forces in the 
east. The violence apparently provided an opportunity for Sudanese 
rebels to cross into Congo and begin intimidating refugees, the U.N. 
refugee agency said. Southern Sudanese leaders have expressed concerns 
that tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees may stream back into Yambio, 
which so far has avoided a famine besetting the region. The U.N. World 
Food Program sent 40 tons of food, enough for 10,000 people for one 
week, to Yambio to relieve the pressure on local supplies. More than 
374,000 Sudanese have fled their homeland's civil war to eight African 
countries _ Uganda, Ethiopia, Congo, Kenya, Central African Republic, 
Chad, Eritrea and Egypt.
