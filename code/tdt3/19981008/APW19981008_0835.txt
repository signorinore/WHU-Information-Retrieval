The chairman of Bucharest's Dinamo soccer club submitted his resignation 
Thursday after allegations that he was involved in a huge cigarette 
smuggling case. Petre Buduru, who works for the interior ministry, 
said he was offering his resignation to avoid tarnishing the team's 
name. He denied allegations that he was connected to a dlrs 1 million 
cigarette smuggling scandal. ``I have replied to every single one 
of the accusations made against me,'' Buduru said by telephone. The 
club's board of directors will decide on Monday whether to accept 
his resignation, he said. The interior ministry will study the allegations 
over the next few weeks, a statement said, carried by national news 
agency Rompres. Col. Gheorghe Trutulescu, a state security officer 
on trial for masterminding the smuggling operation, identified Buduru 
as one of his partners. Dinamo is is second place in the Romanian 
premier soccer league. The club belongs to the interior ministry and 
Buduru has been chairman since 1996.
