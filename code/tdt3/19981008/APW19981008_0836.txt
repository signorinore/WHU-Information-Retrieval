They will replace Kenya, Costa Rica and Japan. Nonpermanent members 
Bahrain, Brazil, Gabon, Gambia and Slovenia will be replaced next 
year. The campaign for the two seats in the Western Europe group caught 
some attention over the summer after Greece invited U.N. delegates 
for a weeklong Aegean cruise. Greece denied the trip _ dubbed by some 
diplomats a ``blue water pitch'' to get votes _ was related to the 
council bid. Canada and the Netherlands also campaigned heavily, with 
the former inviting delegates to a performance of Canada's ``Cirque 
du Soleil'' and the latter staging its own moonlit cruise, albeit 
down New York's East River. On Tuesday, Greece made a final bid to 
join the council, arguing that it was only fair that Greece be allowed 
to assume one of the nonpermanent seats up for grabs this year. ``Greece 
would not do better than any other country in the Security Council 
but it would certainly not do worse than any other country, and I 
think it has to be given this chance,'' the deputy Greek foreign minister, 
Yannos Kranidiotis told reporters. Greece has only been on the council 
once before, in 1952-53. Canada has held the seat five times, most 
recently in 1989-90, and the Netherlands on four previous occasions, 
the last one being 1983-84. Canada and the Netherlands were believed 
to have had the best shot at landing the seats because of the dispute 
over Cyprus, the Mediterranean island divided between Greek and Turkish 
Cypriots. Having Greece on the council could further politicize the 
issue at the United Nations. Others cited the prominent Dutch and 
Canadian presence on peacekeeping forces as well as the continued 
Dutch influence over its former colonies who voted Thursday.
