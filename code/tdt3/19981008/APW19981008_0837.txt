PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - American jazz trumpet player Wynton 
Marsalis on Thursday praised the U.S. President Bill Clinton for his 
refined taste in music. ``The President knows about jazz,'' Marsalis 
told journalist at a press conference prior to his concert in Prague. 
``It's almost unimaginable for anybody to think ...that America would 
have a President with that type of consciousness, a President who 
would ...listen to Thelonious Monk.'' Commenting on Clinton's dinner 
with Czech President Vaclav Havel last month, to which he was invited, 
Marsalis said: ``It's always an honor to be invited to the White House. 
Everybody was there to swing.'' Marsalis, who was awarded the Pulitzer 
Prize for his epic oratorio Blood on the Fields last year, will perform 
in Prague's Lucerna Hall Friday with his Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra 
in a special concert the organizers call ``The Longest Jazz Night.'' 
The concert, sold out long in advance, will be broadcast live on a 
huge screen in Prague's ancient Old Town Square.
