A former U.N. arms inspector for Iraq has demanded his onetime boss 
retract statements that he broke the law by speaking out to the media 
about Iraq's weapons capabilities. The lawyer for the former inspector, 
Scott Ritter, said in a letter that the claims by the chief U.N. weapons 
inspector, Richard Butler, could be considered defamatory, even though 
Ritter may be a public figure. ``If you wish to avoid assuming personal 
liability, we require your prompt retraction of your accusation,'' 
the lawyer wrote to Butler. The letter, dated Oct. 7, said Butler 
told the television show ``Charlie Rose'' in an Oct. 1 interview that 
Ritter broke the law. According to a transcript of the show, Butler 
said he told Ritter ```You have broken the law in speaking in public 
about things that you obtained while on official duty, and I demand 
that you desist from doing that.''' Ritter's lawyer, Matthew L. Lifflander, 
said Ritter broke no law. ``Unless you can tell us otherwise, you 
owe him a public apology,'' his letter said. The lawyer also criticized 
Butler's attempt to quiet Ritter. Butler sent his former colleague 
a letter Sept. 30, saying he had violated the U.N. contract by making 
public confidential information about weapons capabilities. ``You 
must know that the Constitution of the United States affords Mr. Ritter 
the precious guarantee of free speech,'' Lifflander wrote. ``Nothing 
in the United Nations Charter, its rules or its unenforceable agreements 
supersedes Mr. Ritter's rights as an American citizen.'' Since he 
resigned Aug. 26, Ritter has spoken out several times on Iraq's weapons 
programs and on what he said was the failure of the United States 
and Britain to back up their stated claims of wanting to disarm Baghdad. 
Last week, he told the Israeli daily Haaretz that he had sought and 
received Israel's help in tracking down Iraq's nonconventional arms 
program. The United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq after it invaded 
Kuwait in 1990 and has said it will not lift them until Baghdad eliminates 
its weapons of mass destruction. Butler's U.N. Special Commission 
must make that certification.
