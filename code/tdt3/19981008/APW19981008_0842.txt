A German diplomat expressed skepticism Thursday over reports that 
two Germans were aboard a plane that crashed mysteriously in western 
Uganda and that one of them died. Ugandan officials have said that 
two Germans were on the chartered twin-engine aircraft that took off 
from Entebbe airport Sept. 25 and crashed in the foothills of the 
Rwenzori mountains some time later, killing at least four of those 
on board, including a senior army officer and the pilot. There have 
been varying figures on the number of passengers on board the plane 
when it crashed. The Ugandan military has identified one of the dead 
men as German Andrew Gore and said another German survived but had 
not been found. ``The reports are mysterious. Press reports are confusing, 
and there is no transparent information policy on the part of the 
Ugandan authorities,'' Beck told The Associated Press by telephone. 
He said Andrew Gore is not even a German name. There were conflicting 
reports on the destination of the plane. A military spokesman said 
it was heading towards the western town of Kasese. But Army chief 
of staff Gen. James Kazini said his brother, Lt. Col. Jet Mwebaze 
who perished, was flying to visit him at his bush headquarters in 
northeastern Congo. Uganda has at least two army batallions in northeastern 
Congo to protect its borders from attacks by Ugandan rebels of the 
Allied Democratic Forces. But President Yoweri Museveni denies that 
his troops are fighting alongside Congolese rebels trying to oust 
President Laurent Kabila. Civil Aviation Authority spokesman Jim Bitwire 
said no information on the crash would be released until a report 
by an investigating team from the transport ministry was completed. 
``what is happening is that once a commission has been set up, you 
cannot tell anything to journalists,'' he said. ``The minister for 
transport has set up a team to investigate the crash, and it would 
be prejudicial to release any information. Findings will come out 
by Oct. 23.''
