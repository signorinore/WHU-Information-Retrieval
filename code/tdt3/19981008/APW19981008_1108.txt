A military court on Thursday sentenced in absentia a Palestinian to 
life imprisonment for carrying out bombings in southern Lebanon, the 
official National News Agency reported. Ahmed Abdel-Karim al-Saadi, 
the leader of a fundamentalist Sunni group, was accused of bombing 
``religious sites'' and liquor stores between 1994 and 1995, the news 
agency said. It did not elaborate. A co-defendant, Palestinian Bilal 
Shreidi, was sentenced to five years hard labor for the bombings and 
to one year for attempting to kill Lebanese army soldiers, the news 
agency said. Al-Saadi was sentenced to death last year, also in absentia, 
for the 1995 assassination of a fundamentalist Muslim cleric in Beirut. 
Three other co-defendants in the case were hanged in March. Al-Saadi, 
also known as Abu Mohjen, is believed to be living in the Palestinian 
refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh in southern Lebanon. The government 
exercises little control over the sprawling camp on the outskirts 
of the port city of Sidon, and police and the army are reluctant to 
enter for fear of causing heavy casualties in the event of a gunfight.
