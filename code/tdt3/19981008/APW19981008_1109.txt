In a concession to his Communist allies, Italy's premier said Thursday 
that conditions weren't ripe for NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia, 
complicating efforts for an alliance consensus on how to deal with 
the crisis in Kosovo. ``We do not believe that the chances of a political 
solution have been exhausted,'' Premier Romano Prodi told the Chamber 
of Deputies, where he was battling for political survival a day ahead 
of a confidence vote. Prodi said the U.N. Security Council should 
approve any strikes, a doubtful prospect in the face of Russian opposition. 
Later, Prodi appeared to backing off from any definite word now. He 
was quoted by the Italian news agency ANSA as telling some deputies 
from his coalition that the government ``reserves the right'' to decide 
at the last minute whether to back an armed intervention by NATO.
