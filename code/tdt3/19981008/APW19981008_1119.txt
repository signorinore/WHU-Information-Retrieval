Germany on Thursday won the team competition in the show-jumping event 
at the World Equestrian Games in Rome. France came in second, confirming 
its result in the 1994 Worlds in The Hague, while Britain clinched 
the bronze. Germany's Olympic champion Franke Sloothaak on chestnut 
San Patrignano Joly led the powerful team, which had also dominated 
the team show-jumping at the 1994 World Games in The Hague and in 
the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. The Germans also featured Lars Nieberg 
on Loro Piana Esprit, Markus Beerbaum on Lady Weingard and Ludger 
Beerbaum on Priamos. Germany finished with 25.19 penalties, compared 
with to France's 37.36 and Britain's 38.57. The U.S, team, which was 
third after Wednesday's test, finished ninth. ``We are very disappointed,'' 
said Marty Bauman, a spokesman for the Americans. ``There's no explanation 
for what happened today, it was one of those days.'' On the individual's 
side, Olympic silver medalist Willi Mellinger of Switzerland took 
the lead of the provisional standings on grey Calvaro V, followed 
by Sloothaak. France's Thierry Pomel on Thor des Chaines was third. 
With Thursday's test, 25 riders qualified for the next stage of the 
event, which is to be held on Saturday. The U.S. top rider was Alison 
Firestone, of Upperville, Virginia, on Major. She placed eighth. ``Alison 
has a chance'' in the individual, said Bauman. Eric Hasbrouck of Badford, 
New York, also made it in the best 25, capturing the last spot. He 
rides bay Freestyle. On Sunday, the individual show-jumping ends with 
a spectacular final test where four finalists engage in a direct confrontation 
mounting each other's horses.
