Capping a campaign that featured an Aegean cruise, a trip to the circus 
and lots of wining and dining, Canada and the Netherlands beat out 
Greece on Thursday to join the Security Council, the most powerful 
U.N. decision-making organ. U.N. delegates selected the two countries, 
along with Malaysia, Namibia and Argentina, as the five new nonpermanent 
members of the 15-member council, replacing Portugal, Sweden, Japan, 
Kenya and Costa Rica, whose two-year rotating stints expire. ``This 
is good for the Security Council and good for us,'' Dutch Foreign 
Minister Jozias van Aartsen told Dutch TV after the vote. The council, 
effectively the U.N. board of directors, has 10 nonpermanent seats 
and five permanent ones: the United States, Britain, China, France 
and Russia. Every year, five of the nonpermanent seats go up for election 
by a secret ballot before the 185-member General Assembly. Malaysia, 
Namibia and Argentina went uncontested as candidates for their regional 
groups. The two seats slated for the regional group that encompasses 
Western Europe, North America and other countries, however, were contested 
by Canada, the Netherlands and Greece. Their campaign raised some 
eyebrows over the summer after Greece invited U.N. delegates for a 
weeklong Aegean cruise. Greece denied the trip _ dubbed by some diplomats 
a ``blue water pitch'' to get votes _ was related to the council bid. 
Canada and the Netherlands also campaigned heavily, with the former 
inviting delegates to a performance of Canada's ``Cirque du Soleil'' 
and the latter staging its own moonlit cruise, albeit down New York's 
East River. Canada garnered 131 votes, the Netherlands 122, and Greece 
87. A two-thirds majority was required. Canadian Foreign Minister 
Lloyd Axworthy, who has been in town for weeks campaigning, noted 
the ``unorthodox'' tactics used in the council bid. ``Usually in elections, 
where you're walking the streets, you loose a little around the waistline,'' 
he told reporters, patting his belly. ``This one I've managed to gain 
a few, simply by the nature of U.N. campaigning.'' He pledged to use 
the seat to put forth the causes Canada has recently championed, such 
as landmine eradication, ending exploitation of women and children, 
and making the United Nations more democratic. Greek foreign ministry 
spokesman Theodoros Theodorou said that Athens' failed bid showed 
that the 15-member body cannot be considered truly representative. 
``The same countries always return periodically to the Security Council 
and therefore the representative nature of the body is not ensured,'' 
he said after congratulating the Netherlands and Canada on winning. 
He acknowledged that the victors had histories of supporting U.N. 
development programs, which he said, worked in their favor. Greece 
has only been on the council once before, in 1952-53. Canada has held 
the seat five times, most recently in 1989-90, and the Netherlands 
on four previous occasions, most recently 1983-84. Canada and the 
Netherlands were believed to have had the best shot at landing seats 
because of the dispute over Cyprus, the Mediterranean island divided 
between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Having Greece on the council could 
further politicize the issue. Others cited the prominent Dutch and 
Canadian presence on peacekeeping forces and development programs 
as well as the continued Dutch influence over its former colonies 
who voted Thursday.
