Prime Minister Lionel Jospin announced tough, new measures to curb 
violence on public transport, hit by strikes for a third day Thursday 
by conductors demanding protection from juvenile crime. The Socialist 
prime minister said the attitude of youths who commit such crimes 
``is absurd'' and ``self-destructive'' because they hurt those who 
are serve them -- bus drivers and metro and train conductors -- and 
``this is not a game.'' ``These acts will be punished,'' Jospin said 
in an interview on state-run television. Jospin said that the penal 
code will be revised shortly to deal more harshly with cases of violence 
toward transport workers. And inspectors who currently check tickets 
will be able to verify identities of passengers, Jospin said, adding 
that they would be ``aided by police officers.'' He also said that 
justice would be swift for suspected offenders. Trying to nip the 
strike before it spreads, Jospin pleaded to parents to control their 
children and to public transport employees not to ``overreact.'' More 
than one million commuters were stranded at train stations, according 
to radio reports. Traffic jams stretched up to 30 kilometers (19 miles) 
outside Paris as drivers tried to beat the strike, which left suburban 
rail services virtually paralyzed. There was some relief, 6th graf,
