Suspected Muslim militants lobbed three grenades at Indian security 
forces in troubled Kashmir on Thursday, killing at least two soldiers 
and wounding another four, police said. Nine passersby were also injured 
in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state and the center 
of insurgency since 1989. A few hours later, the rebels blew up a 
scooter outside local government headquarters, wounding at least 12 
people, police said. The window panes of the state secretariat building 
and more than a dozen nearby shops were shattered by the blast. Five 
of the injured needed hospital treatment, police said. Security forces 
cordoned off parts of Srinagar after the attacks and carried out house-to-house 
searches for nearly five hours. The rebels want Kashmir to become 
independent or join neighboring Pakistan, an Islamic state. Kashmir 
is the only Muslim majority state in predominantly Hindu India. India 
accuses Pakistan of training and arming Muslim guerrillas. Pakistan 
says it lends only moral support. India and Pakistan have fought three 
wars, two of them over control of Kashmir, since each gained independence 
in 1947. India controls two-thirds of Kashmir and Pakistan the rest.
