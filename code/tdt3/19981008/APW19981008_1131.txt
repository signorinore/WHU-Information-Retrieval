Prosecutors on Thursday asked the high state court in Frankfurt to 
give 10 years prison to a woman accused of helping terrorists in a 
1977 Lufthansa airliner hijacking, in which the pilot was killed. 
Monika Haas, 50, is charged smuggling weapons and explosives from 
Algiers to the Spanish island of Palma de Mallorca, where she allegedly 
delivered them to the hijackers. Haas had special interest in the 
group because she was once married to one of them, prosecutors said. 
Four hijackers, members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine, later used the weapons to hijack the Lufthansa jet on Oct. 
17, 1977 with 82 passengers on board. After flying to Rome, the hijackers 
made stops across the Mediterranean and North Africa. The pilot was 
killed in South Yemen. The final stop was Mogadishu, Somalia where 
German commandos stormed the plane early on Oct. 18, 1977. One terrorist, 
Suhaila Al-Sayeh, was severely wounded; her three male companions 
were killed and the passengers and remaining crew rescued. The hijackers 
had demanded dlrs 15 million and the release of jailed members of 
Germany's leftist terrorist Red Army Faction, responsible for the 
September 1977 kidnapping of Hanns-Martin Schleyer, president of the 
German employers' federation. After the raid, Schleyer's body was 
discovered and three Red Army Faction leaders were found dead in their 
prison cells. Authorities said the three had committed suicide. Al-Sayeh, 
now known as Souhaila Andrawes, was arrested in Norway in 1994. She 
had been released after a year in jail in Somalia. Prosecutors said 
information she gave to Oslo police, along with newly discovered East 
German secret police files, was the basis for the charges against 
Haas. However, Al-Sayeh refused to testify against Haas when she was 
called to do so in July 1996. Haas, the mother of three children, 
has denied ever being on Palma de Mallorca. She was first arrested 
and freed again in 1992, then charged in 1994. Her trial began in 
January 1996. In March 1997, she was freed on her own recognizance 
to resume work as a medical assistant, after the court determined 
there was no reason to believe she would attempt to flee although 
she remained on trial. Closing arguments by the defense are expected 
on Oct. 19, after which a verdict could also be read, or scheduled 
for a later session.
