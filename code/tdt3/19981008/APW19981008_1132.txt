Authorities said overloading may have caused an excursion boat carrying 
some 140 French retirees to sink Thursday, killing at least 20 people 
in a tranquil lake in northeastern Spain. ``Police are working on 
the theory that the boat was overloaded,'' said a spokeswoman for 
the regional government's rescue operation center in Barcelona. The 
passengers were all French. Thirteen people drowned and seven others 
died in local hospitals. Two people who purchased tickets for the 
excursion were missing. It was not known whether they boarded or not, 
said the spokeswoman, who in keeping with custom, declined to be identified. 
Xavier Pomes, a regional government delegate, said the boat was only 
licensed to carry 80 people but he added that only a full investigation 
would show whether overloading was the problem. Pomes said the boat 
would not be brought up until Friday. A total of 38 people were treated 
in hospital although by evening time only 22 were being kept in, two 
in serious condition. Eighty-one people, including the boat's Spanish 
captain, survived the accident uninjured. The boat company had sold 
141 tickets for the excursion. So far only 139 people, including the 
pilot, have been accounted for. ``It's a miracle. I don't know how 
to swim,'' said one survivor, identified only as Marie-Madeleine, 
who told French radio how her husband saved her. ``I stopped breathing. 
I stayed a minute under water and must have grabbed onto a bar before 
being pulled out of the water.'' When the passengers realized the 
boat was in trouble many jumped overboard and swam to shore. Many 
others were caught onboard having being seated on the lower deck. 
Police said the boat tried to turn back when the pilot realized it 
had problems just 10 meters out. It sank just two meters from shore. 
``We could see old people up to their necks in water shouting for 
help and other people crying,'' an unidentified schoolgirl told national 
television. At nightfall, police underwater divers halted the search 
for more bodies from the sunken electrically-powered catamaran craft. 
Bodies covered in blankets lined the small pier at the lake in the 
immediate aftermath of the accident. Some bodies were pulled into 
small rowing boats. The boat sank under clear skies and in calm waters 
as it set off Thursday morning to circle Lake Banyoles, just north 
of Barcelona and some 350 miles (565 kilometers) northeast of Madrid, 
the Spanish capital. The vessel, launched earlier this year, made 
50 trips a day on the lake, a spokesman for the La Carpa firm that 
owned it, said. The passengers were all French retirees from the western 
coastal area around the town of La Rochelle, 400 kilometers (250 miles) 
southwest of Paris. Lake Banyoles, two kilometers (1.5 miles) long 
and some 700 meters (765 yards) at its widest, is the largest natural 
lake in the northeastern region of Catalonia and was used for several 
water events in the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics.
