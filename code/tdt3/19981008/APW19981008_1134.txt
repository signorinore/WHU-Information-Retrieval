Authorities have closed down nearly 1,500 food kiosks and put on trial 
more than 6,000 street vendors in a crackdown aimed at preventing 
diseases through contaminated food, an official said Thursday. ``The 
situation has now been contained,'' Abdullah Sid-Ahmed, the health 
minister of Khartoum state, said. He said police accompanied by health 
officials have shut down 1,432 food, vegetables and fruits stalls 
in the state of Khartoum since the crackdown began last Saturday. 
A total of 6,128 people who were put on summary trials received punishments 
ranging from verbal warning to fines and flogging, Sid-Ahmed was quoted 
as saying by the state-run Omdurman Radio. The crackdown is part of 
a wider campaign to combat water and food borne diseases during the 
monsoon months of August, September and October. Every year up to 
40 percent of Sudan's 25 million people come down with malaria during 
the rainy season. Sid-Ahmed said that 16 hospitals and 68 clinics 
in Khartoum have ``intensified their efforts for the treatment of 
malaria and diarrhea.'' A slaughterhouse in northern Khartoum also 
was closed down. As a result, ``we have controlled the increase in 
malaria, diarrhea and eye diseases,'' he said. Low-flying planes have 
been spraying insecticides over vast areas surrounding the capital 
following the spread of mosquitoes and flies as a result of heavy 
rain and the flooding in the Nile. This year's flood, the worst in 
decades, damaged tens of thousands of homes and farms. Last month, 
officials reported 200,000 people were left homeless in eight states.
