Serbian police detained the director of the ethnic Albanian information 
center in strife-torn Kosovo province but released him unharmed after 
three hours, the center reported Thursday. Enver Maljoku, the director 
of Kosovo's Information Center which is close to the province's ethnic 
leadership, was held for three hours Wednesday night in a police station 
in the provincial capital Pristina. Maljoku's mobile telephone, press 
documentation and tapes were confiscated. One of the interrogating 
policemen, dressed in civilian clothes, openly threatened Maljoku's 
family, the Center said. The latest incident came amid increasing 
pressure on ethnic Albanian journalists reporting in Kosovo. Some 
have already ceased working and left the province. Maljoku, a former 
journalist himself, has been working as the Center's director since 
its founding in 1993. He was attacked in July this year when unidentified 
gumen shot at him entering his home one evening. The bullets hit a 
wooden fence in front of Maljoku's house.
