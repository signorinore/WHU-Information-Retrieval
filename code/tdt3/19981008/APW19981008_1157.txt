Prime Minister Lionel Jospin predicted Thursday that France would 
for the most part be spared ill effects of the international financial 
crisis because the ``bases for growth are solid.'' But he proposed 
the launch of a ``big European loan'' to support Europe-wide growth. 
``The storm and the hail falls on lots of regions of the world, but 
not directly on Europe today,'' the Socialist prime minister said 
in a television interview. Europe ``is a space and a region better 
protected than its neighbors.'' Jospin said that the current crisis 
proves ``that liberal (economic) ideas are dangerous in an era of 
globalization.'' Globalization, he said, must be regulated, notably 
by national policies that support growth and European decisions ``turned 
more toward growth.'' He said the recent victory of Germany's Gerhard 
Schroeder made possible a common European policy of growth.
