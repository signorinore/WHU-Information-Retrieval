Thursday President Clinton will enter the history books alongside 
presidents Andrew Johnson and Richard Nixon. The House of Representatives 
has scheduled a floor vote to begin a formal impeachment inquiry. 
The measure is almost certain to pass. Wednesday the White House continued 
its attack on republicans saying the process is being politicized. 
If the vote were held with the American public the president would 
apparently be spared the humiliation.
