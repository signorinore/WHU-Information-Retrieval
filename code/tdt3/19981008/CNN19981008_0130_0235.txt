Visa and Mastercard sit next to each other in thousands of wallets 
and purses. In fact, three out of every four credit card purchases 
in the United States are charged on a visa or a Mastercard. Now the 
federal government is saying those two have too much control. A justice 
department suit is challenging the joint control of both networks 
by the same group of banks. Attorney general Janet Reno says it's 
consumers who are hurt by a lack of competition. Visa, Mastercard 
and their member banks have agreed not to issue cards on smaller competing 
credit card networks such as discover and American express. These 
exclusionary rules deny consumers the ability to choose among a variety 
of credit card products. America's consumers have lost out. Both visa 
and Mastercard say they will defend their policies in court. A visa 
spokesman says he believes the suit will fail because consumers have 
unlimited choices when it comes to credit cards. The suit grew from 
a complaint two years ago from American express. It sees the action 
as a major step in breaking what it calls an illegal strangle-hold 
on the industry.
