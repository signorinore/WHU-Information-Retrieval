The house has passed a Bill that would require companies to verify 
the age of an Internet user before it shows material deemed harmful 
to minors. Companies would also have to get parental consent before 
collecting personal information about children from the net. Analysts 
say the Bill contains the first federal privacy regulations for the 
Internet. Several Internet companies are working on their own privacy 
initiatives to show Congress further regulation isn't needed.
