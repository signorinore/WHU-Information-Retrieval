New government figures show the number of AIDS deaths last year fell 
47%. About 46 Americans A-day died of AIDS in 1997. That's down from 
118 in 1995. New AIDS drugs are getting most of the credit for the 
sharp decline. AIDS is now the 14th leading cause of death in the 
United States, down from number ten.
