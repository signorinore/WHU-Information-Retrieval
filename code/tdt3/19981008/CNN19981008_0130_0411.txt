Mideast leaders will try to seal a new peace plan in the United States 
next week. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian 
authority President Yasser Arafat will meet with President Clinton 
beginning October 15th. Secretary of state Madeleine Albright made 
the announcement, after meeting with Netanyahu and Arafat in the Gaza 
strip Wednesday. She says they made substantial progress. My intention 
in coming here was to put in place building blocks for the Washington 
summit and to do everything I could to try to create spirit of cooperation. 
And to have the possibility of discussing all of the relevant subject 
that will be a part of the Washington summit. So I didn't come here 
for any plan beyond wanting to put building blocks into place, and 
I feel good about that. One of the main issues to be addressed during 
next week's summit is Israel's withdraw from an additional 13% of 
the West Bank.
