With a look at your "Headline News weather," I'm Karen McGinnis. Temperatures 
will remain rather mild across the central United States. 70s and 
80s all the way from the dakotas and into Texas. 70s and 80s can also 
be found across the southeastern United States. 50s and 60s are wrapped 
around the Great Lakes into the northeast as well as Washington, Oregon 
and portions of the great basin. In our forecast for Thursday going 
into Friday, a frontal system stretching all the way from Canada, 
along the eastern seaboard and into the gulf of Mexico will trigger 
some wet weather from Atlanta, to Charlotte and into Philadelphia 
as well as into New York City. Temperature-wise, in Anchorage, it 
will be a cool 45 and still some gusty trade winds across the Hawaiian 
islands. Showers and storms are expected Friday into the mid-atlantic. 
Temperatures will cool down across Canadian border states for Saturday, 
and by Sunday we're expecting 40s across central Canada with windy 
conditions for the interior west.
