Many Americans depend on chiropractors to help them with back pain, 
and other ailments. New studies are raising the question -- do chiropractors 
really help? Rhonda Rowland reports. Now put your contact hand in 
position. You are looking at future chiropractors in training. Practice 
the flick of your elbows. Chiropractors are most in demand for the 
relief of back pain. Whether or not spinal manipulation can actually 
help a sore back has long been debated. Several studies have suggested 
it can help. But a just-released study in "the New England journal 
of medicine" shows chiropractic care offers only marginal benefit. 
Researchers compared chiropractic manipulation to a type of conventional 
physical therapy in people with low back pain. The study found patients 
in both groups did just slightly better than people who received only 
an educational booklet on back pain. We actually expected that both 
physical therapy and chiropractic care might be better than usual 
care. I guess, if anything, we were surprised how small the difference 
really was. Sid Williams is president and founder of the world's largest 
chiropractic school. I'm always disappointed when chiropractic isn't 
way out in front, and I realize that this particular study isn't. 
But what it indicates is more and more research is needed. The study 
also found chiropractic and physical therapy tripled the cost of care. 
Here at life University students learn how chiropractic care can help 
with a variety of conditions. Conditions such as high blood pressure, 
diabetes, ear infections, autism and asthma. Most doctors are adamantly 
opposed to chiropractic's use for medical conditions other than selected 
musculo-skeletal problems. A second study in "the New England journal 
of medicine" shows chiropractic care was useless in children with 
asthma. But in this case, chiropractor sid Williams disagrees with 
the study's conclusions. The reason they denied it was because the 
simulated response was the same as the actual response, when in reality 
both of them were acceptable chiropractic procedures, because we teach 
them. The latest studies will not end the debate over chiropractic 
care, and even its staunchest supporters agree it's good that research 
continues. Rhonda Rowland, CNN, Marietta, Georgia.
