Top stories are next. And ahead in consumer news -- we'll delve further 
into this question of credit card competition and find out just what 
a "smart card" is. Nobody loves CARS MORE than I do. Each one is a 
work of art. So when a maker of all these chose a new antifreeze, 
it got my attention. General Motors now uses the dex-cool technology 
of havoline extended life antifreeze in virtually all its new vehicles. 
The same patented formula you can use in your car. For 5 years or 
150,000 miles. So do what GM did, switch to havoline. I use it in 
my car. I only wish this were it.
