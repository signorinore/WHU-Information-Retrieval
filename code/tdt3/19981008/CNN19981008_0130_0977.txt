AT&T hopes it and its customers will get lucky with its newest Venture. 
The telecommunications giant has started the lucky dog phone company, 
a new long-distance service that lets people make less expensive calls 
by dialing extra digits, and one that offers customers prizes like 
airline tickets and tvs. AT&T wants to compete with other dial-around 
services. It decided not to use its own name, though, for fear it 
would lose its existing customers.
