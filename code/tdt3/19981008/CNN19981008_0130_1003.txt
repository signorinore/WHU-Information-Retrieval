In the government's suit against visa and Mastercard it lists smart 
cards as one of the casualties of decreased competition among credit 
card companies. Rick Lockridge looks at what Americans are missing. 
Plastic, the twin rulers of revolving debt. Visa and Mastercard. Americans 
make 75% of their credit card purchases with one or the other. So 
dominant are these two cards that the justice department alleges that 
they have effectively prevented the newer, smarter credit card technologies 
from getting a foothold in America the way the so-called smart cards 
have in Europe. Smart cards are smarter than traditional credit cards 
thanks to an embedded microchip that stores more kinds of customer 
data and the allows more flexible usage than the magnetic strips on 
the backs of traditional cards. But are Americans ready to abandon 
an old system that works for this? I don't want to use a smart card 
unless there are a lot of merchants who have smart card readers. The 
merchants don't wanna undertake the expense of the smart card readers 
unless a lot of people have the cards. In France you can use the vetaille 
smart card to pay for a doctor's visit. And when do you, the card 
stores your updated patient information. Smart card proponents say 
built-in security features ensure that the consumers money and privacy 
are protected. That can be in your cards or in your pocket. This means 
privacy and not big brother. But some experts say there is no guarantee 
that Americans will embrace smart card technology even if the government 
can loosen visa and Mastercard's alleged stranglehold on the American 
credit card market. This technology for smart cards is still somewhat 
immature. Look for the rise in Internet commerce to possibly decide 
this issue. Studies show consumers don't like giving their credit 
card numbers over the net. And new supersecure smart cards under development 
just for Internet shopping could tilt the balance and force American 
card issuers to get a little smarter. Rick Lockridge, CNN, Atlanta.
