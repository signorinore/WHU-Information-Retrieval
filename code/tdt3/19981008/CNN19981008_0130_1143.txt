Baseball highlights next in "Headline Sports." After that -- the dawning 
of a new day for pickles. Boundaries. From the very beginning... we 
have resented them. So what happens? Some of us grow up to be business 
people. And what do we face? More boundaries. The telecommunications 
boundaries that separate local from long distance... voice from data... 
domestic from global. And force you to accept separate carriers separate 
networks, a blizzard of bills. Ah, but there is a way through those 
barriers. Right through here. The port of entry to a seamless global 
network that lets you have one carrier one contact, one Bill. And 
makes it seem as though the old boundaries no longer exist. Because 
for you, they won't. On-net. From MCI Worldcom. Genesis park! That's 
the worst neighborhood in the city of Charlotte. It was really bad. 
There were no birds. There were no children. There were no Flowers. 
They told us that grass would never grow in that yard. And then as 
we did ours... other homeowners started working in their yards. Genesis 
park is a beginning. You see little, young children in the street 
playing. How did I know genesis park was getting better? The birds 
came back. The Fannie Mae foundation.
