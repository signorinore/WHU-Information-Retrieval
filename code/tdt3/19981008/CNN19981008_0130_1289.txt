Duane Walker, "Headline Sports." First stop is the alcs where the 
Cleveland Indians have tied the Yankees at one game apiece with a 
4-1 victory over the Bronx bombers. David justice blasted a homer 
for the tribe. But it was a controversial bunt by Travis fryman that 
allowed Cleveland to score an insurance run. Yankee second baseman 
Chuck knoblauch failed to get the loose ball and Enrique Wilson stumbles 
in to score. The series now shifts to Cleveland. The play occurred 
right at the base. And the fact that he was literally on the base 
or half a step off the base when it hit him, he has a right to be 
in that position. No question about it, he was on the grass, but you 
can't tell an umpire what he saw, and especially when two other umpires 
come in and just shake their heads up and down like, "sure." If that's 
what he saw, that's fine with me. The umpire's job is to get the call 
right. And it looked to me like they discussed it and so they would 
get it right. And I thought that they got it right. It was a rainy 
night in Georgia and game one of the nlcs between the padres and Braves 
has been delayed due to wetness.
