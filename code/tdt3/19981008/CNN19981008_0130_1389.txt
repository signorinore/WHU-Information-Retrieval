The Coliseum area in the early '90s was dilapidated buildings, overgrown 
lots... and basically it wasn't an area you would want to be caught 
in. Oh, now, they can't believe that it's the same area. When people 
come in they say, "where did these houses come from?" "Is this the 
same neighborhood?" Homeownership is the main ingredient. When you 
own your own home, it gives you a feeling you belong. You stand for 
something. We look at the neighborhood and we look at the house and 
we feel like we've accomplished something. The Fannie Mae foundation.
