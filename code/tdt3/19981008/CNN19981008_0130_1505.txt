For anyone passionately concerned about cucumbers, take heart, the 
future of the pickle is now. Jeanne Moos has the story. a lot of folks 
have a chip on their shoulder when it comes to pickle chips. Well, 
they fall out. Pickle slide. It's a big problem, right? Major problem. 
But soon your burger may be safe from pickle slide. No, don't be scared 
of it. It's just a pickle chip. Oh boy. a chip like that comes from 
a nuke of a cuke. Pretty big isn't it? Frank meczkowski basically 
invented the giant pickle, a pickle vlasic, the country's biggest 
producer, calls revolutionary. We call him the Thomas Edison of pickles. 
It took four years to develop a humongous cucumber. Right now we go 
up, do like a 4a, 4b. But this is a 5b. It's like shoe sizes for cucumbers? 
yes. And by developing an 11 to 15-inch cucumber -- a cuke that dwarfs 
regular pickles. Vlasic succeeded in creating a pickle chip that covers 
an entire hamburger, though as Jay leno joked -- McDonald's has had 
that for years, haven't they pretty much? "Hi, may I help you?" Hi, 
can I get six regular hamburgers? And please don't forget the pickles. 
Don't forget to put pickles on the hamburgers. Here, give 'em this 
one, tell them to put this one in. They didn't. It's pathetic. Pathetic 
pickle. But it sure did tickle this guy. No really, this is a -- but 
no one's laughing at the new power pickle -- 3 1/4. -- versus the 
old chips. A mere 1 1/4. It's scary. They grew this -- they mutate 
-- you know they mutate these things. So like, save the cucumbers. 
You're worried about what they're doing to cucumbers? I'm just worried 
about it's -- it's just unnatural. Pretty big. Pretty big, right. 
Pickle on steroids. No, it's not on steroids really, it's naturally 
grown. No, I like it. It's good. I'm not scared any more. Okay. So 
there are a few Kinks. It's very yellow. Researchers say they're working 
on growing a greener giant cucumber. I had a dream about giant pickles 
the other day. Did they look like this? Well like -- it was a whole 
pickle like this big. I'm sure it was a really phallic dream, but 
-- Better stick to chips. Hamburger stackers will come about 12 to 
a jar. They won't be in stores until December. Well I won't be pregnant 
then, but I'll still have my pickles. So big, they smother their smaller 
cousins -- steamroller the competition. Let the chips fall where they 
may. The code name for the top secret pickle research was project 
frisbee. And if you can throw a frisbee to a dog, why not a giant 
pickle? Yaaaaah. Jeanne Moos, CNN, cherry hill, New Jersey.
