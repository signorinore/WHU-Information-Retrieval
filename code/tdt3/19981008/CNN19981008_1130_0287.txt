House and Senate negotiators could be nearing agreement on a pared 
down $9 billion tax cut Bill the measure would mainly benefit businesses. 
And it would spend none of the $1.6 trillion budget surplus forecast 
over the next decade. On the subject of spending, the federal government 
is a week into the new fiscal year and Congress has so far sent only 
6 of 13 annual spending bills to the president. The government is

leaders are trying to resolve dozens of budget disagreements with
