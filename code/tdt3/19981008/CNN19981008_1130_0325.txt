Major league baseball is looking at a major rules change, but it has 
nothing to do with how the game is played on the field. Congress has 
approved legislation partially overturning a 75-year-old ruling that 
exempted baseball from anti-trust legislation. The change would allow 
players to go to court over anti-trust disputes with owners. President 
Clinton is expected to sign the legislation.
