President Clinton says he will be personally involved in next week's 
mideast peace talks to be held in rural Maryland. Secretary of state 
Madeleine Albright met Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the Gaza strip yesterday to arrange 
next Thursday's meeting. The Israelis and Palestinians will try to 
break a 19-month deadlock over land and security that has blocked 
final status talks on Palestinian self-rule.
