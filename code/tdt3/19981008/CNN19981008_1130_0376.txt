Secretary of state Madeleine Albright says she expects NAto to authorize 
air strikes on Serb forces within the next few days. But she hopes 
the crisis can end without violence. She has sent special envoy Richard 
Holbrook back to Belgrade to meet for a fourth time with Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to try to persuade him to withdraw his 
forces from Kosovo. Western diplomats and staff members left Belgrade 
for Hungary today as a precaution against Serb retaliation. NAto says 
the next move is up to Yugoslavia. This is a period in which we are 
still assessing compliance. And President Milosevic is obviously making 
up his mind whether he's going to fully comply or not. Pentagon sources 
say the United States will provide 260 aircraft to NATO's possible 
military operation in Kosovo. The warplanes would include two B-2 
stealth bombers, 12 F-117 stealth fighters and dozens of F-15s and 
F-16s based in Europe. If ordered into combat, it would be the first 
such use of the B-2 bomber. The sources say no movement orders have 
been issued for any of the aircraft at this time.
