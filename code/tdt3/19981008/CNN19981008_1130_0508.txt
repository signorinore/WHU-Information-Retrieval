I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "Headline News weather." Temperatures 
today quite cool back through the northern Great Lakes. You'll find 
temperatures only in the 50s, 60s will continue all the way back down 
into the Tennessee valley today. In contrast, it's warming up in parts 
of the plains. You'll find high temperatures back into the 80s. That 
will extend into the front range as well. Forecast weather maps later 
today on into Friday, slow-moving front along the eastern seaboard 
will produce more heavy rains through the northeast right on through 
the nighttime hours tonight. By late tomorrow, the front slowly should 
be moving away from the coast. Showers should be on the increase in 
the pacific northwest as we head over the next 24 hours. High pressure, 
fair weather for the midwest and much of the rest of the west. The

to affect mainly right along the east coast. You'll find some rain
