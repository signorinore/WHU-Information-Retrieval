A warning for airline passengers -- just because you have a ticket 
doesn't mean you have a seat. Lori Waffenschmidt looks at how airlines 
are determining who is boarded and who is bumped. Airlines can give 
your seat away if you don't check in 10 to 20 minutes prior to flight 
departure time. When are you checked in for a flight? I'm officially 
checked in when they receive my bags. One common mistake that people 
make is they think that they're checked in for the flight if they've 
simply checked their bags, and that's not always the case. Some airlines, 
want you to check in at the front desk, and some airlines say it's 
okay to check in at the gate. Your reservation may be canceled if 
you're not in the gate area ten minutes prior to departure, so double 
check with the airline on its requirements. You really don't feel 
like you're on the flight until you're actually getting on the plane. 
If you show up too late, and your seat has been given away. The airline 
will typically try to book you on their next flight out. Go to the 
nearest telephone call your travel agent, or call the airlines and 
try to get yourself on the next flight. It may be that you can do 
it inexpensively, and you may have to pay a premium. Carriers don't 
have to compensate you if you violate their rules by showing up late. 
If you're so late that your reservation has been canceled, airlines 
may owe you a refund, but they can tack on cancellation fees. If you 
have a non-refundable ticket, in most cases you're out of luck. And 
there are ripple effects. If the airline cancels one portion of your 
reservation, it may cancel the next leg, or return trip as well. Lori 
Waffenschmidt, CNN, Atlanta.
