It's that old, sinking feeling on Wall Street. Let's get the latest 
numbers from Valerie Morris in New York. Here we go again, Valerie. 
Here we go again. A major sell-off in stocks and bonds this morning. 
Investors staring at a big plate of unappetizing news, including tumbling 
markets in Europe and Japan, a sharply falling dollar, and a warning 
from financial giant J.P. Morgan that the United States will enter 
a recession in 1999. Right now, the Dow industrials are -- down near 
its low lof the session down 177 points at 7564. Third no doubt that 
people are looking for a safe haven. I think green salesman alluded 
to that yesterday. On the other hand, from any longer term sense, 
I would have to argue that unless short rates come down and we have 
some deflationary environment, we we certainly could have, I think 
the long bond has done its thing for a while.
