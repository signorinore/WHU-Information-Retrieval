It was a late night for the Braves and the padres. We'll tell you 
who came out on top, next, in "Headline Sports." Taz! taz! Looks like 
taz just got his AT&T phone Bill. Taz, don't you MAKE A lot of calls 
on Sunday? Yes, taz call, taz call. Then use MCI FIVE cent sundays. 
It's just five cents a minute. EVERY Sunday. AT&T charges three TIMES 
AS much. Uh-oh. taz! Just call 1-800-sundays and become an MCI customer. 
Yeah!
