Jerome Jurenovich, "Headline Sports." After a two hour weather delay 
in Atlanta, Ken caminiti rained on the Braves parade with a tenth 
inning home run, giving San Diego game one of the national league 
championship series, 3-2. I tried to get it over the plate more, it 
was a pitch I could handle, I thought, so I took a good swing at it. 
That's all I've been trying to do, is put a good swing on it, and 
I haven't been doing it, so I finally got some good rhythm and timing, 
and so hopefully I can carry that on. The American league championship 
series is even at a game apiece. Chuck knoblauch argued with the umpire 
instead of retrieving the ball in a timely manner after Travis frymen 
was hit with it while trying to reach first base in the top of the 
12th. That allowed the winning run to score as the Indians beat the 
Yankees 4-1. No question about it, he was on the grass. But you can't 
tell an umpire what he saw, and especially when two other umpires 
come in and just shake their heads. The play occurred right at the 
base. And the fact that he was literally on the base, or half a step 
off the base when it hit him, he has a right to be in that position.
