A California man is chasing his dream of a lifetime, on the football 
field. At age 40, Jeff young may be one of the oldest college football 
players to compete nationally. Only one player has him beat -- a 46-year-old 
who played for a Pennsylvania team in 1994. Young says he's been wanting 
to get back of the field since turning down college offers in 1976 
for personal reasons.
