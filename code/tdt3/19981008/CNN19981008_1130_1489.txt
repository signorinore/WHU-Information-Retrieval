Some priceless stolen artifacts are headed back to Peru. The items 
are being returned three 3 1/2 years after they were found by U.S. 
customs agents in a Miami airport warehouse. Some of the items were 
taken from one of south America's richest archaeological digs. Others 
were stolen from museums. The 208 artifacts include an ancient mummy's 
head, a tattooed arm, and gold objects rivaling those found in king 
tut's tomb. Some of the pieces are more than 2,000 years old.
