"Headline News." Good afternoon, I'm Kathleen Kennedy, in today for 
Chuck Roberts. Thanks for joining us. Investors took a beating today 
as stocks, the dollar, and the usually Placid treasuries market plummeted. 
Unofficially, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at about down 
10 points. It had been down 273 points early in trading. Meanwhile, 
the world's fourth largest bank, J.P. Morgan, is predicting a recession 
for 1999. While some banks have predicted slower economic growth next 
year, Morgan is the first to forecast a major economic downturn. Stay 
with "Headline News" for complete coverage of the markets in "Dollars 
& Sense" at 16 past the hour.
