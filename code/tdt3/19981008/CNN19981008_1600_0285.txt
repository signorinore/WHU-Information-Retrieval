The president focused on Medicare today. He promised to help an estimated 
50,000 Medicare beneficiaries affected by the decision of HMOs not 
to renew their Medicare contracts next year. Mr. Clinton says federal 
approval for other plans hoping to take up the slack in coverage will 
be expedited. He promised to keep Medicare recipients fully informed 
on the status of their benefits. I am launching a comprehensive public 
information campaign to make sure all affected seniors understand 
the health coverage plans that are already available to them. We'll 
bring together a broad public and private coalition from the aarp 
to the older women's league to the social security administration 
to local offices on aging to educate seniors about all their rights 
and options. We must say to them, "losing HMO coverage does not mean 
losing Medicare coverage. You are still protected by Medicare."
