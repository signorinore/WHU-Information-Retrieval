NATO is moving closer toward using military force in Kosovo. Secretary 
of state Madeleine Albright met with NATO leaders in Belgium today. 
Afterward, she said NAto was ready to authorize air strikes. Albright 
says Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has only a few days left 
to withdraw Serbian military and special police units. The U.S. embassy 
staff has already left Yugoslavia. They left for Hungary after a Yugoslav 
leader threatened to take unspecified actions against western diplomats 
if NATO struck. The United States says it wants more cooperation and 
less confrontation. Time and again, Milosevic has promised us to do 
things he had no intention of doing. Time and again, he has taken 
half measures to avoid the consequences of actions. Yet, even in the 
last two weeks, even as he has made cosmetic gestures in the direction 
of compliance, his forces have committed some of the worst atrocities 
of the war. We must assume that Milosevic will continue to do the 
minimum necessary to avoid NATO action. He has to understand that 
the minimum is not good enough. Special envoy Richard Holbrooke will 
return to Belgrade and meet with Milosevic for a fourth time.
