This look at your "Headline News weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map. The cold front that's made its way across the entire 
breadth of the nation will be found right along the east coast by 
Friday morning. Still some rainfall to be found from New England all 
the way down the east coast and through Florida. As we put our map 
in motion, you'll see that that weather system moves away quite slowly. 
Another frontal system pushing through the west should not have any 
precipitation associated with it, but a second front rolls into western 
Canada, and that could bring some rain shower activity into Washington 
and Oregon. Here's your forecast map for high temperatures on Friday. 
And as you can see, the plains states are warming again. They were 
cooled off by that cold front that has moved into the east. Cool weather 
continues in the northeast and in the northwest. In your extended 
forecast -- on Saturday, rain showers linger along the eastern seaboard. 
And as we move ahead to Sunday, you can see the rainfall moving through 
the northern plains states with a few showers likely in the New England 
states. Meanwhile, cold weather moves down across the Canadian border 
into the northern Rockies and the northern plains states. For more 
weather information, log onto CNN.com for four-day forecast for 6,100
