The crew of the space shuttle "discovery" is getting ready for a full 
dress rehearsal of their mission now three weeks away. Among those 
who will be aboard -- senator John Glenn, who was the first American 
to orbit earth in 1962. The current astronaut corps is doing what 
it can to make the space pioneer feel at home. You look at all the 
people on this crew and the people on my crew and the reason I'm here 
or most of these people are here is because of John Glenn and the 
original seven. Looking back, I'm thinking these guys are American 
heroes. And I know that term is sometimes used loosely. But if I could 
think of any hero, it would be John and the six other people and the 
gemini, Mercury and Apollo astronauts. So for me to be here and see 
John Glenn fly again, it's really something. It's like history has 
come full circle at NASA, and it's exciting. Glenn will be the oldest 
person to fly in space at the age of 77.
