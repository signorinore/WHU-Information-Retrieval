The U.S. Navy is getting rid of more than 3 million gallons of Vietnam-era 
Napalm. The jellied gasoline will be shipped from a storage facility 
near San Diego, California, to an incinerator outside port authur, 
Texas. Over the next two years it will be used to burn other hazardous 
chemicals. Local lawmakers say the incineration was supposed to take 
place somewhere else. Environmental groups are critical of plans to 
ship the Napalm by rail.
