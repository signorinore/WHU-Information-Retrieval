A French pleasure tour turned into a disaster when a crowded Ferry 
boat sank in Spain. Ben McCarthy reports. The pleasure boat was carrying 
about 140 passengers, mainly French pensioners. It was about to set 
off on a trip around lake banolez when eyewitnesses say it seemed 
to split in two, throwing people into the water. Many of the elderly 
passengers struggled to get out. And at least 20 people are believed 
to have drowned. Divers have been sent down to examine the boat's 
Hull, where it's thought survivors could be trapped in air pockets. 
The lake is in northeastern Spain, not far from Barcelona. The French 
tourists are thought to come from La Rochelle, on the west coast of 
France. Survivors are being taken to local hospitals for treatment. 
The boat was only launched on the lake last year. And the stretch 
of water which is just two kilometers long is very calm. Investigators 
are now trying to work out why the boat seemed to disintegrate before 
it had even set sail. Ben McCarthy, itn.
