Well, when a patient undergoes an asthma attack they are literally 
gasping for breath. When I have an asthma attack, it's... really, 
really scary. Asthma is caused by an inflammation of the lung. The 
new medicines that the pharmaceutical industry have created for asthma 
allow the patients greater flexibility in their lifestyle. Hopefully, 
one day, no one will suffer from asthma anymore. Boundaries. From 
the very beginning... we have resented them. So what happens? Some 
of us grow up to be business people. And what do we face? More boundaries. 
The telecommunications boundaries that separate local from long distance... 
voice from data... domestic from global. And force you to accept separate 
carriers separate networks, a blizzard of bills. Ah, but there is 
a way through those barriers. Right through here. The port of entry 
to a seamless global network that lets you have one carrier one contact, 
one Bill. And makes it seem as though the old boundaries no longer 
exist. Because for you, they won't. On-net. From MCI Worldcom.
