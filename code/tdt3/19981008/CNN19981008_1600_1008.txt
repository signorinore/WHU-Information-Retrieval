It's another big losing day on Wall Street. With an unbelievable finish. 
Beverly Schuch has the closing numbers from New York. Hi, bev. hi. 
If you've been falling the stock market all day, you knew there was 
a decline all day. Then the Dow staged a miraculous comeback in the 
last 30 minutes. Despite the Dow's bounce, the overall market was 
battered quite hard. The broader markets were all lower with the NASDAQ 
shedding 43 point the, about 3% of its value. Financials were certainly 
weak today. Chase Manhattan gained $1 at the end of the close. Bonds 
also sold off in a big way. The 30-year treasury now down with 2 3/32.
