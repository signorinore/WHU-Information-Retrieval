Packard bell/NEC says it will cut its U.S. workforce by as many as 
1,000 jobs, or 20%, by the end of the year. The California-based company 
is majority-owned by Japan's NEC corporation. The staff reduction 
is not expected to affect overseas operations of Packard bell in either 
Europe or Latin America.
