With "Headline Sports," I'm Russell Biven. Well, less than 24 hours 
after losing to the padres in ten innings, the Braves will once again 
host San Diego in game two of the national league championship series. 
Tonight's matchup pits Tom glavine against Kevin brown. Nobody in 
this locker room has taken anything for granted. Regardless of the 
fact that we're 1-0 right now, it doesn't mean squat, because you 
still have to go out and play the game. We didn't take things for 
granted to get in this position, and we're not going to start now. 
San Diego could be without slugger Greg Vaughn. He left last night's 
game with a strained left quadriceps.
