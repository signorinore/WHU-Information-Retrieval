Americans may be wild about Beanie babies, but in Hong Kong, a different 
animal toy has consumers lining up. Mike Chinoy has the story. In 
the worst economic slump in a generation, long lines on the street. 
Not of the unemployed, but the obsessed. Obsessed with snoopy, courtesy 
of McDonald's. For the last month, the fast food chain has been offering 
plastic snoopy toys for sale -- 28 different versions, each in the 
national costume of a different country, just under $1 apiece. And 
people here in Hong Kong have gone crazy. I don't know. They are crazy 
about this snoopy. And I don't find it just for kids, like this is 
only for kids. But I think even adults, they are collecting this. 
"I start queuing at 6:00 every morning," says this woman. "So far, 
I've got 15." Hong Kong's case of snoopy-mania has not only produces 
massive lines and the occasional fist fight among would-be collectors, 
it's even produced a snoopy black market. In this tiny shop in a back 
Alley, annie Chan takes orders for snoopys at 25 times their restaurant 
price. The full collection -- all 28, which costs 21 U.S. dollars 
at McDonald's -- goes here for $325. And there's no shortage of customers. 
"What's the point in queuing up for hours at McDonald's when you can 
buy them here?" Asks this woman. "And I don't have to throw away all 
those happy meals." How do you explain snoopymania? "If you don't 
collect them," says this man, "it's almost as if you've lost out." 
In a status-conscious town, if everyone else wants it, it's got to 
be worth something. And these days, it's safer than hedge funds. In 
the McDonald's TV ad, it's even worth the British taking Hong Kong 
back. Mike Chinoy, CNN, Hong Kong.
