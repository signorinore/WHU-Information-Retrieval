It is original the third time in history lawmakers have take thn step. 
Today, House of Representatives voted to begin a far-reaching impeaching 
inquiry of President Clinton. House speaker Newt Gingrich presided 
over a debate. In the end, the impeachment inquiry was approved. The 
rest of the democrats and one independent. Mr. Clinton says it's out 
of his hands. Personally, I am fine. I have surrendered this. This 
is beyond my control. I have to work on what I can do. What I can 
do is to do my job for the American people. I trust the American people, 
they almost always get it right, and have for 220 years. And I am 
working in a way that I hope will restore their trust in me by working 
for the things our country needs. These things that we are going to 
discuss at this budget meeting, that is what I can have some impact 
on, and that is what I intend to do. The 258 votes supporting the 
resolution included 31 democrats who joined the unanimous republicans. 
That's about 15% of democrats crossing over. Reaction to the vote 
was also along party lines. It's a victory for the process, it's a 
victory for the constitution. The constitution has provided for circumstances 
like this, our founding fathers and the framers did, and we find ourselves 
at this time confronted with a situation that needs resolution. So 
the process is working. And with 30 votes from the democrats, we can 
build on that. That indicates some understanding of what we are trying 
to do. The president betrayed his wife! He did not betray the country. 
God help this nation if we fail to recognize the difference. So what's 
next? First, the investigation can begin immediately. The chief GOP 
investigator will determine the scope of the probe. Already, the house 
Judiciary committee has voted to go beyond the limits of independent 
counsel Ken Starr's report. Public hearings are expected to begin 
shortly after the November elections.
