No matter how house representatives voted today. Ed Garsten has the 
reaction in east lancing, Michigan. Sitting on the fence can be a 
painful exercise especially for a freshman member of Congress. Democrat 
Debbie stabenow of Michigan's 8th district has been feeling that pain 
and disappointment. We ought to be moving ahead in a responsible bipartisan 
way. And I was hoping until yesterday that could happen. It wasn't 
until she used her precious two minutes in the well of the house that 
the former Michigan state legislator revealed on which side of the 
fence she'd land. We must address this crisis fairly and responsibly 
and get back to the people's business. The people she represents in 
her diverse district range from conservative suburbanites in their 
neat tract homes to the more liberal leaning students and faculty 
at Michigan state University. Indeed there is no consistency in her 
constituency in reaction to her vote. I would not be in favor of her 
decision. I believe they should pursue impeachment for obvious reasons. 
I do, and believe it or not, I am a republican. There are other who's 
sat on the fence along with the representative. I see a lot of value 
in stoping to talk about this. I also feel that the president broke 
the law, and so he should be punished. One supporter just didn't care. 
I just don't. I mean, politics and what's going on today in politics, 
I'm not interested anymore. Her re-election opponent sue munson is. 
She says this vote provides fodder for the campaign. I'm not sure 
it will be a deciding factor in the race. It certainly is another 
point of comparison between the two of us. Stabenow hopes the comparison 
is favorable to her as she attempts to graduate from congressional 
freshman to sophomore. Ed Garsten, CNN, east lansing, Michigan.
