House and Senate negotiators could be nearing an agreement on a pared-down 
$9 billion tax cut Bill. The measure would mainly benefit businesses. 
And it would spend none of the $1.6 trillion budget surplus forecast 
over the next decade. On the subject of spending, the federal government 
is a week into the new fiscal year. And Congress has, so far, sent 
only 6 of 13 annual spending bills to the president. The government 
is operating on a temporary Bill which expires tomorrow night. Republican 
leaders are trying to resolve dozens of budget disagreements with 
the administration in hopes of avoiding a partial government shutdown.
