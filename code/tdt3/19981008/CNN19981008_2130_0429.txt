Secretary of state Madeleine Albright is warning Yugoslavia it only 
has a few more days to stop the violence in Kosovo, before NATO orders 
military strikes. Albright is sending U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke 
back to Belgrade in an attempt to persuade Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic to comply with the international community. Albright says 
time is of the essence. It was very clear from all the people who 
spoke that we understood that time is running out. That the humanitarian 
situation, which we've all discussed, is not improving. That winter 
is coming on and that there has to be some action. U.S. officials 
say if NAto is called into action, the American contribution would 
be limited to air power and no American group troops would be used.
