20 people drowned, and twice that number were injured, in an accident 
on a scenic lake that was the site of the rowing competition in the 
1992 summer Olympics. A tour boat sank on lake banyoles about 60 miles 
northeast of Barcelona. All the victims belonged to a French tour 
group. Witnesses said the boat was about 25 yards from shore when 
it began taking on water. The craft was licensed to carry 80 passengers, 
but there are reports more than 140 people were aboard.
