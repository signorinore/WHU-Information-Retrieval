Time now for the extended weather forecast. This look at your "Headline 
News weather" begins with our forecast weather map for Friday morning. 
Rainfall continued to cover parts of the eastern seaboard associated 
with the frontal system moving very slowly, as a matter of fact you 
can see portions of it turning stationary through Friday. And rainfall 
continued from Maine to Miami. Meanwhile behind us, an area of high 
pressure builds in with some cooler temperatures, but across the plains 
states and parts of the midwest, they're beginning to warm again. 
Meanwhile, another cold front moves to the west, but no precipitation 
expected to be associated with this system. But another cold front 
is moving in through western Canada, and that could bring some rainfall 
into Washington and Oregon. As we head on into Friday evening, we 
can see the frontal system in the east very slowly begins to move 
off the east coast. Here's your forecast for high temperatures, as 
I said, the plains states begin to warm up again, with 80 degree readings 
expected in the southern plains states, but cool in the New England 
states and in the northwest. Your extended forecast through Saturday, 
showers and thunderstorms Hang along the eastern seaboard. But cool 
weather rolls in through northwest. As we move on into Sunday, you 
can see the cool weather along the Canadian border and some rainfall 
in the northern plains states. For more weather information, log on
