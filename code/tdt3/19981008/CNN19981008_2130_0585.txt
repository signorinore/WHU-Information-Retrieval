A 75-year-old Portuguese novelist has won literature's top award -- 
the nobel prize. Jose saramago is considered a nonconformist who champions 
the cause of the common man. The Swedish academy cited his imagination, 
compassion and irony in announcing his selection. Among saramago's 
books is "the stone raft," in which the iberian peninsula breaks off 
from Europe and floats into the atlantic. His work has been translated 
into more than 20 languages.
