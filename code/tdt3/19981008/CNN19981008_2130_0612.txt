A 911 operator in Florida has been suspended after he was accused 
of asking a woman who called in for an emergency for a date. The sheriff's 
office investigated after the story appeared in a newspaper. The paper 
reported that the woman called 911 to report a burglary. 20 minutes 
later, the operator called her and asked her out. They dated for three 
weeks. The newspaper says he reedly used sheriff's office equipment 
to find the names, addresses and phone numbs of women.
