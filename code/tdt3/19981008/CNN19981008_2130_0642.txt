NASA's Hubble telescope has produced new images that are letting astronomers 
take a trip back in time to get a look at the history of our universe. 
Rick Lockridge reports in this tech trends. In a tiny corner of the 
sky in one of the darkest, emptiest regions of deep space, the Hubble 
telescope's powerful new infrared camera has found the faintest, most-distant 
galaxies ever seen. Perhaps 12 billion light years away. In a sense, 
this is the Lewis and Clark expedition of astronomy is the was I like 
to think of it. We could have found nothing, as Allan said. The fact 
we did find new objects means we have not reached the edge here. The 
new pictures show baby galaxies, still clumpy and uneven only a few 
hundred million years after the birth of the universe. Scientists 
think the hot spots in this picture indicate areas of intense star 
formation. And they hope Hubble's newly enhanced ability to see far 
across space and therefore far back in time will help answer longstanding 
questions about the history of our universe. We can put together a 
much more complete scenario of how our universe changes from this 
starless gas cloud to this intricate system of galaxies, stars and 
planets that we see today. The Hubble's new infrared camera, installed 
by a space shuttle crew last year, makes it possible for the telescope 
to see through the shrouds of space dust that obscure distant objects. 
This view is from Hubble's regular camera. When you look at the same 
galaxy through the new infrared camera, you can see where the dust 
was interfering with the old picture. NASA says better pictures than 
these are unlikely until the planned launch of the so-called next 
generation space telescope in 2007. Rick Lockridge, CNN.
