If buying on the Internet is how you shop, Congress is trying to keep 
that tax-free. The Senate overwhelmingly approved a land-Mark legislation 
that bans new state and local taxes on the Internet for three years. 
The Bill, which is similar to one passed by the house, prohibits new 
taxes on Internet access and electronic commerce. The Senate passed 
the Bill by a vote of 96 to 2. President Clinton is expected to sign 
the Bill once its differences are hammered out by the house and Senate.
