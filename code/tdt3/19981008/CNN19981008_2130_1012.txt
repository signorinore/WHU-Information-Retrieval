The slumping stock market is helping more American airlines pilots 
retire early. Pilots get most of their retirement money from a company 
mutual fund. The "Wall Street Journal" says a contract quirk gives 
them a three-month window to retire at a set share price. Although 
the fund's value has dropped 10% since July, pilots who retire now 
can take advantage of July stock prices. That payout can be worth 
hundreds of thousands of dollars. As a result, American has had to 
cut back on flights to Latin America.
