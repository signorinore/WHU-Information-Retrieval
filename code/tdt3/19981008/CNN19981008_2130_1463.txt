School children in Taiwan were called to duty this week when a pair 
of rare green sea turtles found themselves stranded. It was an unusual 
hands-on science lesson for the school kids and a good day's work 
for the rescue crews. The turtles are on the verge of extinction. 
And the shores of Taiwan are among the few places where they come 
to lay eggs.
