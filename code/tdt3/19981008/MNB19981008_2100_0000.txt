The president betrayed his wife. He did not betray the country. God 
help this nation if we fail to recognize the difference. This is not 
about sexual misconduct any more than Watergate was about a third-rate 
burglary. It was about the reaction of the chief executive to that 
event. The debate and finally the vote. An historic moment. The House 
of Representatives voting to go forward with an impeachment inquiry. 
Time having expired, the ayes are 278. The nays are 176. Personally 
I am fine. I have surrendered this. This is beyond my control. I have 
to work on what I can do. The president universally criticized today 
for inappropriate behavior. The debate tonight -- can William Jefferson 
Clinton survive? And a good Thursday evening to you.
