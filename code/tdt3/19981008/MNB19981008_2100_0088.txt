The president of the United States is one step closer tonight to being 
removed from office. An extraordinary day on Capitol Hill. For only 
the third time in history, Congress has approved an impeachment inquiry 
and so Bill Clinton, a president by all accounts nearly obsessed with 
a legacy -- the appearance of his legacy now joins Andrew Johnson 
in history's files. The debate was the first order on the files today. 
Both sides of the aisle prepared to go over the length of the hearings 
which seemed inevitable in the republican controlled house and the 
vote did fall primarily along party lines. 278 voted to hold impeachment 
hearings. Still 31 of those who voted yes are democrats. We're going 
to cover this historic day from a number of angles and take a look 
at the political and legal implications.
