Even before the vote was taken, President Clinton knew an impeachment 
inquiry was certain. In the aftermath, how is the White House handling 
it. We turn to Claire Shipman at the White House. Linda, it may seem 
hard to believe, but the White House is looking for some way, even 
a small way, to cast tonight's vote in a positive light. Fewer democrats 
defected than expected, they point out. Only 31. This, they say, was 
a partisan vote. But you don't have to push very hard to get them 
to admit that the vote itself was clearly a defeat. The president's 
reaction was one of cooperation, but with another message for republicans, 
too. First of all, I hope that we can now move forward with this process 
in a way that is fair, that is constitutional, and that is timely. 
And the subdued Bill Clinton added, he's accepted the uncertainty 
of the coming months. It's not in my hands. It's in the hands of Congress 
and the people of this country. Ultimately in the hands of God. There 
is nothing I can do. But behind the scenes aides are starting to map 
out a survival strategy. The midterm election and democratic success 
is the first hurdle. He'll need that support in the hearings. But 
unlike the president's barn storming four years ago, he'll largely 
sit this vote out. The president has to take on a political strategy 
that maximizes the ability of democrats to win in their seats, and 
if that means don't travel -- if it means don't go into a member's 
district, then so be it. Mrs. Clinton, on the other hand, has a full 
campaign schedule. Aides say the first lady is very much in demand 
and a formidable asset. In terms of a strategy for the hearings, the 
White House doesn't yet know how closely it will work with democrats 
on the hill. Aides here haven't decide for example whether it will 
make sense for the president to testify before Congress if he's asked. 
But one strategy aides are pushing here, if anybody is listening, 
chipping away at Kenneth Starr and any perceived misconduct, making 
the hearings as much about Starr as Clinton. Linda? NBC's Claire Shipman 
at the White House.
