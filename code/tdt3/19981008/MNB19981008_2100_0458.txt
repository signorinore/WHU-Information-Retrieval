And it was a bad day for the White House on more than one front today. 
Aside from the house voting to hold open-ended impeachment hearings, 
there were developments in the Paula Jones case. Here is NBC's Lisa 
Myers with that. Today's ruling means that hundreds more potentially 
embarrassing documents will be made public before the election. And 
if that weren't bad enough, even Mr. Clinton's own lawyer now has 
written a letter raising questions about the president's truthfulness. 
In a sealed letter to the judge in the Paula Jones case, the president's 
lawyer Robert Bennett writes that Monica Lewinsky's affidavit, denying 
sexual relations with the president, was, in fact, misleading and 
not true. That puts Bennett directly at odds with his client, the 
president, who testified in January that the affidavit was "absolutely 
true." A claim he repeated just last month to the grand jury. President 
Clinton remarkably kept insisting that the Lewinsky affidavit was 
a truthful affidavit. What his lawyer is saying now is that the affidavit 
should not be relied on. It contains untruths. A source close to Bennett 
insists he's not cutting and running on the president but had "an 
unavoidable ethical obligation to correct the record." Sources say 
Bennett did not know when he held up Lewinsky's affidavit in January 
as proof "there is absolutely no sex of any kind." That it was in 
fact a lie. Here is one more person saying the president lied to me. 
At president's defenders say even if he wasn't entirely truthful, 
he was only covering up an affair. Five of the 15 possible grounds 
for impeachment involve the president's knowledge of and involvement 
in Lewinsky's false affidavit. One charge added by republicans this 
week, that the president lied to the grand jury. When asked why he 
allowed Bennett to use an affidavit Mr. Clinton knew was false. I 
was not paying attention. However sources tell NBC news, a videotape 
of the president's deposition clearly shows him paying attention. 
As for Paula Jones, tonight's sources say negotiations toward a cash 
settlement of her case are in a delicate stage. The president has 
offered $700,000, which Jones so far says is not enough. Lisa Myers, 
NBC news, Washington.
