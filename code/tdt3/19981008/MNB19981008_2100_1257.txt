It was a brumingts morning on Wall Street and then a soaring afternoon. 
The end result -- just about a wash. The Dow Jones industrial average 
closed down only about 10 points at 7732 on very, very heavy volume. 
The third busiest trading day in the history of the New York stock 
exchange. The NASDAQ took more of a hit. Down 43 1/2 closing at 1419. 
Also an extremely busy day. More than 1.2 million shares traded. Error 
joined by Ron Insana who has been following this wild ride. As we 
mentioned, at one point the Dow was down severely, so what happened 
to the markets today? A lot of things in fact account for this wild 
ride we saw again today on Wall Street. The Dow as said down as much 
as 270 points at one juncture. A couple of prominent Wall Street strategists 
made Negative comments about the stock market today. One of whom suggested 
the market could go substantially lower from current levels. Additionally 
worries about the president's precarious political situation and there 
were more rumors that these big hedge funds be very big sophisticated 
investment houses were having troubles and that tended to undermine 
the activity on Wall Street today as well. Now we're hearing a lot 
about the steep fluctuations of the U.S. dollar. What is going on 
there? Nearly an unprecedented amount of volatility in the value of 
the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. Just two days ago the dollar 
sold for 130 yen. This morning it was 111 before bouncing back sharply. 
As you can see, these big investors, the hedge funds had made enormous 
bets that the dollar would keep going up against the yen. When those 
didn't work out, they've been forced to sell dollars and it caused 
all that volatility. What a lot of people are hoping for is that the 
federal reserve might move soon to put a little more stability into 
the system by cutting interest rates and that's something people will 
be watching for in the days ahead. Just quickly, are there any signs 
the market will calm down? Indeed, financial stocks rallied sharply 
at the end of the day. Bonds stabilized today and in fact their improvement 
may be a hint that officials in Washington might be ready to take 
more bold action to help out Wall Street and potentially main street 
as well.
