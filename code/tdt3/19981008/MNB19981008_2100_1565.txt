Time now for a look at the weather across the country and for that 
we go to WNBC-television in New York and meteorologist Janice huff. 
Janice, good evening to you. Hi, Linda. I know it's a little late 
in the evening to say a word like that but anyway we have lots of 
wet news about the weather in the east tonight. It's finally moving 
to the eastern seaboard and brought a lot of heavy rain from Maine 
down towards New York City and parts of the carolinas -- it looks 
like Raleigh, North Carolina picked up about two inches of rain from 
the system and there have been isolated thunderstorms there. One to 
three inches of rain near the New York City metro area, parts of New 
Jersey and Connecticut the right now temperatures behind that front 
are in the 40's and 50's tonight. Chicago right now at 54. Meanwhile 
it's warm in Florida. 80 degrees right now in Orlando. Looks like 
most of the cold air will remain across the Great Lakes and over the 
inner mountain region. A snow advisory in effect for the cascades 
tonight. Highs tomorrow in the 50's in Seattle and Portland. 70's 
around San Francisco. Columbia, South Carolina, 80's for Florida. 
60's around New York City with maybe a few leftover showers. If you're 
traveling tomorrow you see rain in Boston. 68. Some sunshine early 
in the day in D.C. but maybe some showers late in the day,. 1 -- 71. 
And the jetstream will provide more showers for the pacific northwest 
tomorrow. Cool weather and more snow in the mountains. Cool in the 
northeast by Sunday, but warm across the southern states. Windy, warm 
weather from the bay area down towards Los Angeles. By Sunday, and 
that's the weather around the nation. Linda, back to you. All right. 
Janice, thank you.
