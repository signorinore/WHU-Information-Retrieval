Well, ever since we all heard John Glenn would return to space as 
the world's oldest astronaut, he's been getting a lot of personal 
questions about his upcoming mission on the space shuttle discovery. 
Today the 77-year-old senator scolded reporters for focusing too much 
on him. Let me criticize the press a moment here. Too often you get 
into the human aspects of this, you don't get into the scientific 
stuff that gets into everybody's house all over this country and this 
program of what we're about here with the 83 experiments, most of 
them are designed to benefit people right back home. The experiments 
that Glenn and his fellow astronauts will conduct include studies 
on plant growth and a cancer pill. Lift-off is scheduled for October 
29.
