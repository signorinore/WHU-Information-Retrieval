Plans are in the works for NATO action in the province of Kosovo. 
Secretary of state Madeline Albright spent the day meeting with her 
European counterparts in an attempt to shore up support for air strikes. 
Albright is sending special envoy Richard Holbrooke for the fourth 
time to Belgrade to tell Slobodan Milosevic that he must withdraw 
his troops from Kosovo. She had this to say this evening after meeting 
with the foreign ministers of Russia, Germany, Britain, France, and 
Italy. It was also very clear from all the people who spoke that we 
understood that time is running out, that the humanitarian situation 
which we've all discussed is not improving, that winter is coming 
on, and that there has to be some action. In the last seven months, 
hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have been forced 
from their homes or have fled to the hills to escape Serbian oppression.
