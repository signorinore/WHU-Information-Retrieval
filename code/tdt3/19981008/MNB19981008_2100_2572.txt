Well, the winner of this year's nobel prize for literature was announced 
today. It went to a Portuguese writer, Jose saramaga. This is the 
first time the prize has been awarded for works written in Portuguese. 
He was nominated for the nobel several times before but he never won. 
He was unaware of today's announcement until his publisher tracked 
him down in an airport with the good news. One of his best known works 
is a novel called "the stone raft."
