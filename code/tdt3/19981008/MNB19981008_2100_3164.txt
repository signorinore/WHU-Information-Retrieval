Thank you very much. We have to leave it there. Mark mellman and rich 
galen, thank you both for your very civilized debate. Thank you. When 
we return, a look at tomorrow's headlines and as the house moves forward 
be we'll tell you what's left behind. Claritin. Escape sneezing, runny 
nose, itchy eyes. Blue skies smiling at me only one tablet means 24-hour, 
nondrowsy seasonal allergy relief! Claritin. The number-one prescription 
antihistamine... for ages 6 and over. Claritin has a low occurrence 
of side effects, including headache, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about Claritin. Nothing but blue 
skies from now on call: in the global economy companies can't afford 
to shut down. So America's largest generator of electricity never 
rests. Southern company uses its resources to track the availability 
of oil, gas and electricity 24 hours a day. We keep our customers 
up and running while saving them millions. So at the end of the day 
they know we're still at work keeping the power on. We are southern 
company. Energy to serve your world. Of course, the impeachment vote 
is the top story on all of tomorrow's headlines of the newspapers. 
Expect, of course, also stories on the economy, but we have some other 
stories that we have found in some of the other leading newspapers 
from the "Miami Herald" -- hurricane georges is spurring record relief 
effort. Officials from the red cross are saying relief operations 
for georges very likely will be the most expensive in their 117-year 
history. The cost is approaching about $100 million. That's compared 
to hurricane Andrew back in 1992 which cost the red cross $81.5 million. 
Teen smoking sky Rockets. The number of teenagers who light up each 
day jumped nearly 50% from 1988 to 1996. This is according to the 
centers for disease control. They say 3,000 youths under the age became 
smokers every day. That's up from less than 2,000 back in 1988. This 
from "The Washington Post" -- the topic new fertility treatment. Actually 
talking about doctors in San Francisco. They're attempting a new revolutionary 
fertility treatment. For the first time genes from an infertile woman 
have been implanted in a fertile woman's egg. If successful this procedure 
would allow an infertile woman to have a genetically related child. 
Of course expect some serious legal and ethical questions about that. 
On to other news.
