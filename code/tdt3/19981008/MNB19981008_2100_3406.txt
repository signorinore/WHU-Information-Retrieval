One often heard complaint from the public is that the Monica Lewinsky 
scandal has distracted Congress and the White House and that other 
important issues are getting pushed aside, and now that the house 
has voted to hold impeachment hearings, it do be -- could be months 
before the matter is resolved. NBC's Bob Faw tonight on what some 
would say is a lost agenda. The affair has consumed so much time, 
money, and energy. Congress has been sidetracked and passed only five 
of the 13 billed needed to keep the government running after Friday. 
This is -- I'll say it again -- the worst Congress that's ever sat 
in this building. The firestorm over the president has sucked all 
the oxygen out of the room, says one senator. Among the casualties 
-- bills to regulate H.M.O.'s, to curb teen smoking, to reform both 
social security and securities laws. All dead. A weakened president 
could not get the fast track trade legislation he wanted or new subsidies 
for child care and Congress can't even make up its mind what to do 
about the $70 billion surplus, the first in 30 years. They really 
do need time to make deals, and they have been preoccupied with something 
else. While Congress has been preoccupied both Saddam Hussein and 
north Korea seem closer to developing nuclear weapons there, is chaos 
in Russia, bloodshed in Kosovo, panic in world markets. Some fear 
the administration is too distracted to deal effectively with any 
crisis. Well, one would not choose it as an ideal atmosphere, and 
I do hope that the process will be brought to a -- a reasonably short 
conclusion. Others complain that a lot of good is going undone, because 
the scandal has so tarnished him and consumed us, the opportunity 
for moral leadership has been squandered. Have we lost something that 
we might have been able to accomplish? I'm afraid we probably have. 
Our preoccupation says a lot about our priorities and to some, it 
suggests that our priorities are all wrong. The world is going to 
hell in a hand basket, and America is busy snooping into the private 
lives of public officials. It's tragic really. The president, the 
intern, the prosecutor, the process, the diversion has been costly.
