Food for thought. Before we go, a reminder, coming up next on MSNBC, 
an hour-long special looking back at the day's events on the hill 
and what's expected in the coming weeks. The impeachment debate hosted 
by John Hockenberry. And that is our broadcast for this Thursday night. 
We hope to see you right back here at the same time tomorrow night. 
I'm Linda Vester in for Brian Williams and for all of us here, good 
night.
