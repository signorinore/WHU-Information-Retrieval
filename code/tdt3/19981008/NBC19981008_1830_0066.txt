Good evening. Tonight Bill Clinton knows that whatever else happens 
in his presidency he will be in the history books in a special category. 
Only the third president to formally become the subject of an impeachment 
inquiry which could lead to his removal from office. It was mostly 
a party line vote, with 31 democrats joining the republicans in approving 
an open-ended inquiry. Most of the other democrats favored an inquiry, 
but they wanted a time limit. NBC's Gwen Ifill begins our coverage. 
On a gloomy Washington day, four hours of debate brimming with emotion, 
frustration and some bitterness, ending in a wrenching and historic 
moment. It's our duty. It's an onerous, miserable, rotten duty, but 
we have to do it, or we break faith with the people who sent us here. 
a lopsided vote of 258 to 176, all republicans voted for it, most 
democrats voted against, Even the president of the United States has 
no right to break the law. In the end, 31 democrats, most of them 
conservatives who have disagreed with Clinton on other issues, crossed 
party lines to vote with the republican majority in favor of hearings. 
His actions were not inappropriate, they were predatory, reckless, 
breathtakingly arrogant for a man already a defendant in a sexual 
harassment suit. At least two democrats who normally vote with the 
White House, Lee Hamilton of Indiana and Carolyn McCarthy of New York, 
voted against the president today. But in last minute appeals, democratic 
house leaders lobbied for loyalty if not to the president, to each 
OT every. We're all profoundly hurt by what the president has done. 
But this investigation must be ended fairly and quickly. The tawdry, 
trashy thousands of pages of hearsay, accusations, gossips and stupid 
telephone chatter does not meet the standard of high crimes and misdemeanors. 
The Judiciary I think we'll see a better chance for a nonpartisanship 
to rear its lovely head now that this is behind us. Talks have already 
begun on the best way for democrats now to contain future damage. 
Part of the strategy is to get the White House to admit to some of 
Kenneth Starr's charges up front moving what has become a national 
spectacle to a speedy Con clugs. Gwen Ifill, NBC news, the capitol.
