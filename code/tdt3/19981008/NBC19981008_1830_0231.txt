President Clinton, who knew by today the inquiry was certain, said 
the process should go forward, and he pledged to stay on the business 
of the country. NBC's Claire Shipman at the White House. Tom, the 
White House is working to fashion some sort of victory out of today's 
vote. Fewer democrats defected than expected. They point out only 
31. They argue that makes the partisan nature of the process clear. 
But even here they admit the vote was a defeat, the president's reaction, 
as his aides intended, was one of cooperation with a message for republicans. 
I hope that we can now move forward with this process in a way that 
is fair, that is constitutional, and that is timely. And, the subdued 
Bill Clinton added he's resigned to the coming months. It is not in 
my hands. It is in the hands of Congress, and the people of this country. 
Ultimately, in the hands of God. There is nothing I can do. But behind 
the scenes, aides are starting to map out a survival strategy for 
the coming months. The midterm election and democratic success is 
the first hurdle. And unlike the president's barnstorming in 1994, 
he'll largely sit out this vote. The president has to take on a political 
strategy that maximizes the ability of democrats to win in their seats. 
And if that means don't go into members districts, then so be it. 
Now, in terms of the strategy for the hearings, the White House doesn't 
know how closely it will work with democrats on the hill. Aides haven't 
decided whether it will make sense for the president to testimony 
before Congress if called. One strategy they are already advocating 
is chipping away at Kenneth Starr and any perceived misconduct, making 
the hearings about Starr just as much as the president.
