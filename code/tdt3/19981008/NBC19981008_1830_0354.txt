And more bad news for the president tonight from the Paula Jones case. 
The federal judge in the case has decided to release key documents, 
including the president's and Ms. Jones' depositions. And as NBC's 
Lisa Myers reports, now the president's lawyer in that case has challenged 
a key part of Clinton's testimony. Today's ruling means that thousands 
of potentially embarrassing documents will be made public before the 
election. And, if that weren't bad enough, even Mr. Clinton's own 
lawyer now has written a letter raising questions about the president's 
truthfulness. In a sealed letter to the judge in the Paula Jones case, 
the president's lawyer Robert Bennett writes that Monica Lewinsky's 
affidavit denying sexual relations with the president was, in fact, 
"misleading and not true." That puts Bennett directly at odds with 
his client, the president, who testified in January that the affidavit 
was "absolutely true," a claim he repeated just last month to the 
grand jury. President Clinton remarkably kept insisting that the Lewinsky 
affidavit was a truthful affidavit. What his lawyer is saying now 
is that the affidavit should not be relied on. It contains untruths. 
a source close to Bennett insists he's not "cutting and running" on 
the president, but had "an unavoidable ethical obligation" to correct 
the record. Sources say Bennett did not know when he held up Lewinsky's 
affidavit in January as proof "there is absolutely no sex of any kind" 
that it was, in fact, a lie. Here's one more person saying, "the president 
lied to me." The president's defenders say this makes no difference 
because even if the president wasn't truthful, he was only covering 
up an affair. 5 of the 15 possible grounds for impeachment involve 
the president's knowledge of and involvement in Lewinsky's false affidavit. 
One charge added by republicans this week -- that the president lied 
to the grand jury when asked why he allowed Bennett to use an affidavit 
Mr. Clinton knew was false. I was not paying that close attention 
to what he was saying. I've told you that repeatedly. However, congressional 
sources tell NBC news a videotape of the president's deposition clearly 
shows him paying attention. As for Paula Jones, tonight, sources say 
negotiations toward a cash settlement of her case are in a delicate 
stage. The president has offered $700,000, which Jones so far says 
is not enough. Lisa Myers, NBC news Washington.
