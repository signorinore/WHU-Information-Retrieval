Now to the standoff over Kosovo. Secretary of state Madeleine Albright 
had yet another warning for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
tonight. Time is all but gone. Albright and other western diplomats 
say NATO forces will strike the Serbs unless they halt their aggression 
against ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo region. Albright is sending 
envoy Richard Holbrooke back on a last-ditch mission to tell Milosevic 
to withdraw his troops. So far he has ignored Holbrooke.
