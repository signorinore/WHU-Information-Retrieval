And while all this is going on, inside Kosovo, Albanians terrorized 
by seven months of fighting continue to suffer. Kosovo may seem to 
be a remote place not connected with American lives or interests, 
but the children in Kosovo in their pain and terror tell us a different 
story. NBC's Ron Allen is there tonight. Horrible memories seem to 
haunt 6-year-old egzon, a disabled boy separated from his family when 
they fled a Serb assault in panic. The shelling and the fires, intense 
while the little boy hid alone for hours in the Woods. Now four months 
later, nightmares still wake him. He rarely eats and never speaks, 
symptoms of severe trauma. His family of 17 crowd this tiny house. 
They say the only hope is to get him out of Kosovo. "He'll never get 
better in these conditions," his father says. Seven months of fighting 
in Kosovo has physically and psychologically scarred thousands of 
children like egzon. More than half of Kosovo's 2 million people are 
under age 18. Experts fear an entire generation of children is at 
great risk. You can have a whole society really changing, and the 
whole nature of how business and family are conducted in that society 
change over the next 10, 20 30 years. This is what children still 
must endure, so many bombed out homes in remote villages, some still 
too dangerous for relief workers to get to because the roads have 
land Mines. That's what it's like these days growing up in Kosovo. 
The classrooms of this squalid grammar school Shelter refugees on 
the run children, learning harsh lessons trying to survive with little 
food water and soon winter with no heat. These children are the lucky 
ones. They've reached one of Kosovo's only clinics. Sadette and her 
family walked for months to get here. Her infant's skin, riddled with 
disease and infection because she hasn't had a bath or enough to eat. 
She says her 6-year-old daughter seems lost. Her eyes, often staring 
out into space. This doctor says half the children he sees, dozens 
every week, are just like her. The experts say children are resilient. 
They can recover from the horrors. But first, they must live in a 
safe place and the bloodshed they see every day must end. Ron Allen, 
NBC news, Kosovo.
