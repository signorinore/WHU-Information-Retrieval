And when we come back, NBC news "in depth." The national interest. 
What isn't getting done while this Congress is absorbed in the Clinton 
scandal. My son knows when he does the dishes he has to take his time. 
First the pots and pans have to be set aside, then soaked and scrubbed 
and carefully loaded in the dishwasher. Introducing new cascade plus-- 
packed with amazing power pretreaters... that blast away tough food 
problems you thought your diswasher couldn't handle. Where other detergents 
fail, new cascade plus leaves incredible results. Perfect. New cascade 
plus-- hefty one zip with the hefty slider that clicks closed... for 
freshness. The little guy's got spunk.
