NBC news "in depth" -- tonight, lost opportunities. For months now, 
official Washington has been consumed with the scandal engulfing the 
president. Members of Congress maneuver for power, much of the national 
agenda got lost in the shuffle. "In depth" tonight, NBC's Bob Faw 
and the "nightly question" -- is this the "do-nothing" Congress? L'affaire 
Lewinsky has consumed so much time money and energy, Congress has 
been so sidetracked. It's passed only 5 of the 13 bills needed to 
keep the government running after Friday. This is, and I'll say it 
again, the worst Congress that's ever sat in this building. "the firestorm 
over the president has sucked all the oxygen out of the room," says 
one senator. Among the casualties -- bills to regulate HMOs, to curb 
teen smoking, reform both social security and securities laws. All 
dead. A weakened president couldn't get the "fast-track" trade legislation 
he wanted, or new subsidies for child care. And Congress can't even 
make up its mind what to do about that $70 billion surplus. The first 
in 30 years. They really do need time to make deals, and they have 
been preoccupied with something else. While Congress has been "preoccupied," 
both Saddam Hussein and north Korea seem closer to nuclear weapons. 
There is chaos in Russia, bloodshed in Kosovo, panic in world markets. 
Some fear the administration is too distracted to deal effectively 
with any crisis. One would not choose it as an ideal atmosphere, and 
I do hope that the process will be brought to a reasonably short conclusion. 
Others complain that "A lot of good is going undone because the scandal 
has so tarnished him and consumed us the opportunity for moral leadership 
has been squandered." Have we lost something that we might have been 
able to accomplish? I'm afraid we probably have. Our preoccupation 
says a lot about our priorities. And to some it suggests that our 
priorities are all wrong. The world is going to heal in a handbasket, 
and America is busy snooping into the lives of public officials. It 
is tragic. The diversion has been costly. Bob Faw, NBC news, Washington.
