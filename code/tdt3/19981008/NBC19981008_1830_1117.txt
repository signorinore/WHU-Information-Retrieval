But there are those who believe that in good times less is more. One 
such believer, Stephen Wayne, who teaches government at Georgetown 
University. Professor Wayne tonight, "in his own words." Believe me, 
if there was public demand for legislation, Congress would meet that 
demand. You know why? Because they fear that if they didn't, they 
wouldn't be re-elected. I don't think this Congress has been stymied. 
I think this Congress is reacting to the conservative mood of the 
public in good times when there's not a lot of pressure to pass a 
lot of legislation. Regardless of the scandal, we would have a Congress 
that didn't enact a lot of new far-reaching legislative measures. 
I think the republicans, at this point, are somewhat fearful that 
they can be labeled a "do nothing Congress" and that's why they've 
hidden behind the impeachment process. I think the democrats are using 
the term "do nothing Congress" because they don't really have anything 
else to campaign on. I think we have a fairly satisfied public legislatively. 
I don't think our public is particularly satisfied by the behavior 
of it's leaders. Professor Stephen Wayne, "in his own words."
