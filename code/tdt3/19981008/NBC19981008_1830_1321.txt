Tonight -- what may surprise you is just how much it matters as you 
grow older. Here is NBC's Rehema Ellis. Everyone knows good food means 
good health. But now they are discoverering that as you get older, 
your body changes. The opposite is true. As we age, we need morph 
some nutrients. That's because your body is less able to get nourishment 
from food. New research shows as you age, your stomach makes less 
acid, so it can't extract as many vitamins from food, like folic acid 
and vitamin b12, crucial to preventing heart disease and stroke. People 
over 50 need 100% more of these vitamins than 30-year-olds. Older 
bodies are also less able to absorb the nitrogen in protein necessary 
for a healthy immune system, so people need to eat 25% more protein. 
You'll get fewer colds. And older skin is 60% less able to turn sunlight 
into vitamin D, which is essential for strong bones. One study found 
that 30%-40% of patients who had hip fractures were deficient in vitamin 
D. But while aging adults need more vitamins and minerals, they may 
actually be getting fewer. It's a greater challenge for older people 
to consume all of these nutrients because their appetites are decreased 
as they grow older, because they're more sedentary, or because they're 
taking drugs that interfere with the absorption of many nutrients. 
What should you do? Make every meal count by packing it with nutrients. 
And experts say, even consider taking vitamins and food supplements. 
If people are used to having a cocktail and chips before dinner, you 
could afford that when you're 30, but when you're 70, that's too many 
empty calories. You've heard it before, but as you age there's no 
avoiding these guidelines -- eat lots of whole grains, colorful vegetables 
that carry plenty of vitamins. Try adding fruit to every meal and 
exercise to increase your appetite. Taking charge of what you eat 
is something you can do that is positive for your health. There's 
no doubt, it will help you "live longer, live better." Rehema Ellis,
