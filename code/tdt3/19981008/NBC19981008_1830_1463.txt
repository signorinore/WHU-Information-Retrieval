I'll be right back. Hi, pumpkin. It's late. You should be asleep. 
Mommy said that I could stay up until you got home. - oh. - What are 
you eating? - Cheerios. - For dinner? They taste just as good at night. 
And remember, I told you they were good for my cholesterol. Oh, yeah. 
An important new study shows... that three cups of cheerios whole 
grain oats a day, added to a low fat diet, can help push your cholesterol 
down. Do you know what else is good for my heart? - uh-uh. - a hug 
from you. The one and only cheerios at Uniroyal, in order to make 
a point about our new nailgard tires we added a few to our test track. 
Nailgard tires-- designed to seal 90% of tread punctures instantly 
and permanently. Only from Uniroyal. Blue savor the summer. Specially 
priced at $14.99. - oh, so lonesome for you - at red lobster, the 
season isn't over.
