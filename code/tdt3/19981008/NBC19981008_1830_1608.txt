Tonight, the head-on collision between small-town sensibilities and 
big-truck demands. It's a clash of interests with no easy resolution. 
And it's getting louder and more confrontational all the time. NBC's 
Jim Avila. Woodstock, Vermont. Where tradition and building codes 
keep the atmosphere strictly colonial. Where tourists spend $48 million 
a year to walk covered bridges in what a national magazine labels 
"the prettiest little town in America." A town now afraid the character 
that makes it special may be broken apart by a destructive enemy on 
18 wheels. Trucks have caused this damage. Gary Smith owns the civil 
war-era Woodstock pharmacy now crumbling, he says, from vibration. 
It's only a matter of time before the buildings cease to be structurally 
stable and they'll fall down. Woodstock can't ban trucks from using 
state route 4 as a shortcut from Maine to New York. In fact, 1,000 
trucks a day Rumble through town. But it can slow them down with safety 
checkpoints. You got some lights out back there. Your brake lights 
aren't working. The trucks come over into the opposite Lane, nearly 
causing an accident over and over during the day. Chief Byron Kelly 
says Vermont's two-Lane winding roads, designed 100 years ago, cannot 
handle 53-foot-long trucks. This one knocked out its rear axle on 
the main street bridge. The chief says it's a road war. Small town 
versus big truck. It's not just intimidation. Of the 200 trucks stopped 
in September, more than 25% received warnings or tickets for violations 
that were sometimes serious, including timber that was not tied down 
to the back and could tip in a turn. Two drivers were even cited for 
marijuana possession. Nationwide, more than 4 million trucks carry 
80% of America's freight. And truckers say small towns are often along 
the most direct routes and should thank them, not hassle them. Take 
away the truck and pretty soon, the only thing that you'll have rolling 
through are tumbleweeds. In Moorpark, California, north of Los Angeles, 
one truck pounds the pavement every 30 seconds in front of Suzanne 
Thomas' horse ranch. It's right here where I'm living. It's right 
here where the animals are living. And it's right here where my food 
is grown. And it's very scary. a serious battle across America for 
towns struggling to save their character and faced with a moving target 
that is bigger, heavier and faster than ever before. Jim Avila, NBC 
news, Woodstock, Vermont.
