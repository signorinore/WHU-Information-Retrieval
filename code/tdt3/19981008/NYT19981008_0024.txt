The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Oct. 8: The 
demise of national tobacco control legislation puts the burden on 
states to find new strategies to reduce smoking and its harmful consequences. 
The California Children and Families Initiative, which will be on 
the November ballot as Proposition 10, provides a model that other 
states could emulate. Proposition 10 would raise the state cigarette 
tax by 50 cents per pack, an increase that should cut smoking rates 
significantly, particularly among teen-agers who are especially sensitive 
to price. An added benefit is the estimated $700 million a year the 
tax would generate to pay for new health, nutrition, education and 
child-care programs for preschoolers. The total pot could reach more 
than $1 billion if the state uses the new revenue as matching funds 
to tap into federal grants. It makes sense to use a tobacco tax to 
pay for children's programs because secondhand smoke and smoking during 
pregnancy have been linked to low-birthweight babies, pre-term births 
and increased asthma and respiratory infections among infants and 
children. Simply reducing the number of parents who smoke would improve 
children's health. The new money would help counties expand children 
and family services, as well as pay for more anti-smoking programs. 
The initiative, spearheaded by the film director Rob Reiner, grew 
out of ideas presented at a White House conference on infant development 
last year that focused on good parenting and health care between birth 
and age 3, the critical period of brain growth. The measure has drawn 
broad bipartisan support and is supported by every major health and 
education association in the state. The primary opposition comes from 
the tobacco industry, which is expected to spend more than $15 million 
trying to defeat the measure. The industry is right to worry. If California 
voters approve this measure, as recent polls indicate they will, this 
initiative could well start a national movement.
