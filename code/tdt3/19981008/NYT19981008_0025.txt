Uta Pippig, the German runner who won the 1993 New York City Marathon 
and three Boston Marathons, was suspended Wednesday by the German 
track and field federation after failing a random out-of-competition 
drug test. The German federation said that Pippig had tested above 
the 6:1 ratio of testosterone, the male sex hormone, to epitestosterone, 
a related chemical. Anything above 6:1 is considered suspicious of 
the use of testosterone as an anabolic steroid to build muscles and 
to allow an athlete to recover quickly from strenuous workouts. The 
test was administered to Pippig on April 23 in Boulder, Colo., where 
she lives and trains. A suspension is the first level of punishment. 
If Pippig, 33, cannot convince authorities that the suspicious urine 
sample was produced by something other than performance-enhancing 
drugs, she faces a two-year ban from the sport. Pippig, who was in 
Germany on Wednesday, seemed to attack the validity of the drug test 
on at least two fronts. Her coach and partner, Dieter Hogen, told 
the German news agency SID that her urine samples _ each test is divided 
into an A and a B sample _ were incorrectly labeled and that one contained 
a leak. He also said that Pippig had experienced fluctuations in her 
hormonal levels related to the taking of birth control pills. Mary 
Slaney used a similar argument about hormonal levels in having her 
international suspension overturned by the U.S. track and field federation 
after a suspicious test at the 1996 Olympic trials. ``I have done 
nothing wrong,'' Pippig told the German news agency. ``I have been 
tested 50 or 60 times and nothing has ever been found. I can't admit 
to something that I haven't done.'' Theo Rous, president of the German 
track federation, told Reuters that there had been some mistakes with 
the test, but that they had not compromised the results. According 
to German press reports, authorities used carbon-isotope testing in 
analyzing Pippig's drug sample, which is a new, advanced method of 
determining the use of synthetic testosterone. Pippig, who was born 
in Leipzig, in the former East Germany, has not been a force in the 
marathon since she won her third Boston Marathon in 1996 while suffering 
from dehydration and bleeding. She dropped out of the 1996 Olympic 
marathon and finished fourth in Boston in 1997. Recently, she had 
been returning to form. On Sept. 8, she ran a personal best of 15:03.72 
in a 5,000-meter race in Berlin. She told Runners World magazine in 
1991 that she had briefly used banned substances while competing for 
East Germany in the 1980s, but had stopped. ``We are 100 percent convinced 
she is innocent of any illegal drug taking,'' Tom Ratcliffe, one of 
Pippig's agents, said in a telephone interview from Boston. ``I know 
she has strong feelings against drugs.''
