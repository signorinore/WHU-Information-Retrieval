Myron E. Scott, a photographer who had such an uneventful career that 
he probably wouldn't have attracted much attention if there hadn't 
been a couple of inspired blips in an otherwise satisfyingly humdrum 
life, died Oct. 4 at his home in Kettering, Ohio. He was 91. Scott 
had left his marks on 20th-century culture as the man who created 
the All-American Soap Box Derby and gave the Corvette sports car its 
name. Considering his role in two of the nation's most cherished innovations, 
Scott was a thoroughly unprepossessing man. A native of Camden, Ohio, 
who grew up in Dayton, where his father was a baker, he attended the 
Dayton Institute of Art before going to work for The Dayton Daily 
News, first as a staff artist, later as a photographer. Scott might 
have spent his life contentedly taking pictures for newspapers if 
it hadn't been for a chance assignment in June 1933. Told to scour 
the area to get pictures of children at play, he was driving through 
the little town of Oakwood when he became riveted by the sight of 
a couple of boys coasting down Big Hill Road on makeshift wooden contraptions 
mounted on baby buggy wheels. Intrigued, he asked the boys to round 
up some of their friends and meet him in a few days for a race. When 
more than a dozen showed up, including one whose rig reminded him 
of a soap box, Scott got not only the picture he wanted, but also 
the idea that would change his life. Sensing the promotional possibilities, 
Scott, who had apparently thought up the name All-American Soap Box 
Derby while composing his picture, persuaded his newspaper to sponsor 
a series of local races during the summer of 1933 and to stage a race 
for boys from different cities the next year. When more than 300 young 
contestants and some 40,000 spectators showed up for the 1934 race 
down Burkart Hill, Scott realized he was on to something big. Big 
enough, anyway, to attract the attention of the General Motors Chevrolet 
division, which agreed to sponsor the race as an annual event. Partly 
because Dayton residents had been annoyed by the disruptions caused 
by the first race and partly because the city of Akron, home to four 
large tire companies, lobbied for the event, it was switched to Akron 
in 1935. With time out for World War II, it has been a staple of summertime 
movie newsreels and television coverage ever since. In getting Scott's 
race, Chevrolet also got Scott. Although he returned to the newspaper 
as art director in 1937, he resumed his work with Chevrolet two years 
later and stayed until his retirement. As a member of the advertising 
department, Scott was asked to attend a meeting one day late in 1952 
to help pick out a name for an ambitious European-style sports car 
Chevrolet was developing. Company officials had decided that the name 
should begin with a C and should not be an animal name, but after 
sitting through the meeting in which 300 names, including Champion, 
Celestial and Challenger, were flashed on large cards and discussed, 
Chevrolet's chief engineer, Edward Cole, said he didn't like any of 
them. That night, at home, Scott paged through the C's in his dictionary 
until he came to the word ``corvette,'' the name of a class of small, 
fast warships used as convoy escorts. The next day, Scott sent a note 
to Cole asking, ``How would you like to go for a ride today in my 
Corvette?'' An hour later, Cole called Scott and asked, ``How would 
you like to ride in MY Corvette?'' Scott's name, he was told, had 
been chosen for the car. Scott, who liked to point out that he got 
neither a bonus nor a day off, let alone a Corvette, for coming up 
with its name, did get his promised ride, however. He drove an early 
model of the first true American sports car, complete with low-slung 
chassis, 20 miles from Detroit to a suburban test facility. He was 
not impressed. As he explained years later, he didn't like ``sitting 
on the road.'' After Chevrolet ended its Derby sponsorship in 1972 
and the race was taken over by a nonprofit corporation, Scott remained 
a soap box celebrity, one who could be a bit crotchety at times, especially 
when he was criticizing the decision to allow girls in the race for 
the first time in 1972. But if Scott was a bit old-fashioned, so, 
of course, was his very vision of an innocent, pre-television America, 
one in which boys from 9 to 16 had the time, the skill, the inclination 
and the reliable parental help needed to turn a soap box into a racer. 
Today's soap boxes tend to be sleek, kit-built plastic cars, but Scott's 
image has not been entirely obliterated. After a time in which it 
was replaced with a modern-looking car, Scott's drawing of a 12-year-old 
at the wheel of an actual soap box coaster has been restored to the 
Derby's logo. Scott, who celebrated his 70th wedding anniversary this 
year, is survived by his wife, Clara Jane.
