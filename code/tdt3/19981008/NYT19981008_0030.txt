Quarterbacks have long been a strength at Virginia Tech, but the team's 
latest starter was reclaimed from the defense and pressed into emergency 
duty Wednesday night against Boston College. Nick Sorensen was Virginia 
Tech's backup quarterback last year but was moved to safety in the 
spring when Coach Frank Beamer and his staff worried about the red-shirt 
sophomore's arm strength and throwing motion. ``He doesn't always 
look real pretty but he has a way of getting the ball where it needs 
to be,'' said Beamer, whose Hokies are trying to go 5-0 for the first 
time since 1967. Virginia Tech is ranked No. 17 in The Associated 
Press poll and is No. 3 in The New York Times computer ranking. From 
Don Strock to Jim Druckenmiller, who currently is a backup for the 
49ers, the Hokies always seem to have a classic dropback passer with 
a bazooka arm. In fact, they started the year with one in senior Al 
Clark, whose promising career has been repeatedly tripped up by injuries. 
In 1995, he was scheduled for the starting position but injured his 
knee in the spring, opening up the job for Druckenmiller, whom he 
ended up backing up for two seasons. Last year, Clark set the Big 
East single season record for lowest percentage of interceptions and 
threw for 1,474 yards and 10 touchdowns. He got off to a quick start 
this year, leading the Hokies to a 3-0 record with routs over Clemson 
and East Carolina and an overtime victory over Miami. But he sprained 
his foot against the Hurricanes, and Dave Meyer, a sophomore, started 
against Pittsburgh. But after staking the Hokies to a 17-7 lead, Meyer 
separated his shoulder in the first series of the second half. So 
Sorensen, who took a handful of snaps the week before the game, filled 
in. ``I didn't really know that I remembered all the plays until they 
were called. They were in my head and they haven't left,'' said Sorensen, 
who completed 2 of 3 passes for 12 yards as the Hokies won, 27-7. 
Clark will be available if necessary, but Beamer says he will stay 
with Sorensen, who received most the snaps the past two weeks as the 
Hokies returned after an off week. Virginia Tech has been winning 
with a defense that has allowed just 66 yards rushing in the past 
two games, but the Hokies will be tested by Boston College's (3-1) 
Mike Cloud, who is the nation's fifth-leading rusher with an average 
of 169 yards a game. ``Their offensive line is the biggest and most 
experienced in the Big East and they're going to try and run the ball 
on us,'' said Pierson Prioleau, the Hokies' all-America candidate 
at defensive back. ``That motivates us.'' nn
