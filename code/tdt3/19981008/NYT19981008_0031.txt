Florida coach Steve Spurrier has quarterback problems of his own making. 
He has decided that alternating them isn't for him after all. Last 
week, he reasoned that when having two equally talented quarterbacks 
like Doug Johnson and Jess Palmer means it is necessary to play both. 
But after the No. 6 Gators (No. 21 in the Times ranking) squeaked 
by Alabama, 16-10, Spurrier changed his mind. Spurrier said he will 
now choose between the pair sometime before Saturday's game against 
No. 11 Louisiana State University ``Normally, the quarterback has 
to be the leader,'' he said. ``You have to look to someone out there 
and usually it's the guy calling the plays, especially if you're going 
to throw the ball 40 times a game like we do. We're going to give 
the quarterback a chance to lead our team.'' It's going to be a tough 
call. Johnson, who sat out most of the first two games while recovering 
from shoulder surgery, has completed 56 percent of his passes and 
tossed five touchdowns. Palmer has thrown the ball 42 more times at 
a 60 percent clip and 13 touchdowns. ``I think Jess probably thinks 
he's the better guy and I probably think I'm the better guy. That's 
how any athlete is,'' Johnson said. ``I want the job, he wants the 
job. It's up to Coach Spurrier.''
