The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Oct. 8: So here 
we are again, edging toward Election Day with no firm idea of what 
the ballots in New York City will look like. In particular, the referendum 
section, often tucked down at the lumbago level of the ballot, is 
still very much in doubt. The cause for this confusion is a highly 
vocal and political battle between Council Speaker Peter Vallone and 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Vallone, who is running for governor, wants 
an item on the ballot that asks voters whether public funds can be 
used to move Yankee Stadium from the Bronx to Manhattan. The mayor, 
objecting mightily to such a limitation on his powers, quickly established 
a contrived Charter Revision Commission to find its own referendum 
that would automatically bounce Vallone's off the ballot. So Vallone 
and his City Council went to court _ in the Bronx, of course _ and 
got a hometown judge to rule for the Vallone referendum. State Supreme 
Court Justice Douglas McKeon, who describes Yankee Stadium as ``the 
tabernacle of sport,'' ruled that the mayor's commission did not make 
a comprehensive review of the charter before devising its ``slapdash'' 
referendum on campaign reform. The mayor retorted that ``when you 
present a political question to a judge who is the product of the 
Democratic machine, you get a Democratic answer, not an honest answer 
to the question.'' The city immediately appealed, and was granted 
a stay. The best outcome would be if a higher legal authority found 
a way to keep both referendums off the ballot. The Vallone effort 
could harden the negotiating process on Yankee Stadium and complicate 
the task of keeping the team in New York City. The mayor's referendum 
is, in many ways, even worse. The mayor used a legitimate process 
for revising the city's constitution as a crude political tool. His 
referendum threatens to disrupt one of the best campaign finance systems 
in the country. These two referendums may be clever political gamesmanship, 
but they are a disservice to New York City voters.
