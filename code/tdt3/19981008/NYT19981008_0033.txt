Two of the young men who pleaded guilty in the kidnapping and murder 
of Nelson Gross, a New Jersey millionaire, were given the maximum 
sentence of 30 years in prison Wednesday. A third accomplice, who 
entered into a plea agreement to testify had there been a trial, was 
sentenced to 17 years in prison. The three-hour session in a packed 
federal courtroom had strains of eloquent anger, muted contrition 
and sobs of shame. The family of Gross as well as the relatives of 
the defendants watched as U.S. District Court Judge Alfred Wolin repeatedly 
rejected the pleas for leniency by defense lawyers for two of the 
young men who were 17 years old at the time of the crime. In spite 
of their age, Wolin said, their crime last year was ``a truly senseless 
thing'' and their behavior was ``cruel and heinous'' as they repeatedly 
stabbed Gross and left his body in an overgrown ravine on the Manhattan 
shore of the Hudson River after extorting $20,000 from him. And, in 
part because of the brutality of the crime and the seeming failure 
of two defendants to take full responsibility, Wolin accepted the 
recommendation of U.S. Faith Hochberg that the two men be sentenced 
to serve their terms at maximum security prisons. ``Every day will 
be spent in a tough, hard jail that is unrelenting in how it handles 
prisoners,'' said Ms. Hochberg after the sentencing, saying that she 
had recommended the federal maximum security prisons in Marion, Ill., 
and Leavenworth, Kan. ``These defendants are now put away, and we 
will not see or hear from them again.'' There is no parole under federal 
law, although it is possible to get some time off for good behavior. 
All of the defendants are expected to serve virtually their entire 
sentences. Federal law allows murder charges only in cases where the 
victim was a federal employee. So Wednesday's sentencing followed 
guilty pleas last February by Christian Velez, 18, Miguel Grullon, 
18, and Tony Estevez, 20, to federal charges of conspiracy to kidnap 
and kidnapping. But, according to prosecutors, a kidnapping that ends 
in a murder carries the same penalty as federal murder charges _ life 
in prison _ under the sentencing guidelines used in federal courts. 
Those same guidelines, however, require that courts lower the penalty 
if the defendants admit guilt and do it in a ``timely fashion'' that 
allows the government to avoid a trial. And the youthful defendants 
had also waived any challenge to the government's decision to treat 
them as adults. Part of the anger in the courtroom Wednesday came 
from the way the defendants were charged. Michael Gross, the victim's 
brother, talked bitterly of the kidnapping charges when murder was 
the ultimate outcome. Gaunt, graying and walking with the aid of a 
cane, Michael Gross addressed the court and called the charges ``a 
nicety,'' but said they hardly obscured the fact that a husband, father 
and brother had been murdered. He also questioned the guilty pleas 
of the defendants, saying that he doubted they had actually had the 
``experience of guilt.'' ``Had they been capable of that,'' he said, 
``they would not have been able to kill him because their own consciences 
would have stopped them.'' The contrition in the courtroom came from 
the defendants themselves, each of whom rose to speak and apologize 
for his crimes to Gross' family. Velez, speaking softly and stiffly 
in Spanish to an interpreter, read from something he said he had written. 
``I want to beg Mr. Gross' family for their forgiveness,'' he said. 
Grullon, dressed in a gray suit and a black, open-collared shirt, 
also read stiffly, but in English, from a statement also asking for 
forgiveness from the Gross family. Only Estevez, in a plaid sports 
shirt and baggy khaki pants, spoke extemporaneously. In a long, rambling 
statement he apologized for what had happened. ``I wish I could have 
done what I want to do now _ go back and stop it all,'' he said. Wolin, 
in sentencing Estevez, noted that not only had he agreed to testify 
against his accomplices but had also opposed the last-minute decision 
of Velez and Grullon to murder Gross, and left the scene without participating. 
Gross was kidnapped at gunpoint Sept. 17, 1997, from the Binghamton 
Restaurant on the banks of the Hudson River in Edgewater, N.J. Velez, 
a former employee at the restaurant, introduced the plan to his accomplices. 
The three, using an unloaded gun, took Gross to a nearby bank and 
forced him to withdraw $20,000. They then drove him to Manhattan where 
Velez and Grullon decided to kill him for fear that he would identify 
them. He was stabbed and hit with rocks, and his body was left in 
the woods along the Hudson, within view of his restaurant.
