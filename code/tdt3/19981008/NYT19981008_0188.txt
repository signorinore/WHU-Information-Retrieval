The odd-couple union between big, hulking Maxwell Kane (Elden Henson) 
and his disabled next-door neighbor, Kevin Dillon (Kieran Culkin) 
is at the heart of the story. By the standards of quirky tales like 
``Freak the Mighty,'' this is not an unlikely pairing. It's pure kismet 
when these two find each other, since Kevin is smart and wisecracking 
in ways that make Max feel less obtuse, and Max can walk. Kevin is 
locked in leg braces and has a disease that will shorten his life. 
A friend of Philbrick's had a son born with Morquio's syndrome, the 
degenerative condition described here. ``The Mighty'' doesn't dwell 
on the morbid, since it is directed by Peter Chelsom (``Hear My Song,'' 
``Funny Bones'') and Sharon Stone is Kevin's noble mom. Dressed as 
just folks, Ms. Stone brightens the movie without seeming like anyone 
who would cook a Christmas turkey with Pat Boone singing ``Jingle 
Bells'' in the background. (Songs on the soundtrack are sometimes 
intrusive.) Ms. Stone gives a game, down-to-earth performance until 
the dialogue protests too much. (``Kevin lives in this world of books 
and words and ideas, things I don't even understand!'') The boys themselves 
are played likably and well, although some of the adult roles pose 
more of a problem. While Gena Rowlands and Harry Dean Stanton appear 
amusingly as grandparents a la ``American Gothic,'' Gillian Anderson 
plays a floozy named Loretta and does what can most flatteringly be 
described as a stretch. Meat Loaf and James Gandolfini figure in a 
menacing, trumped-up subplot about Max's past. Chelsom makes his first 
American film without as much sweet whimsy as his earlier films displayed. 
But his sense of visual enchantment easily accommodates the boys' 
preoccupation with all thing Arthurian and the story's way of letting 
dreams of knighthood loom large and literal from time to time. From 
the directorial standpoint, this was no easy task. PRODUCTION NOTES:
