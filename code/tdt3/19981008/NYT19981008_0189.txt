``I don't allow smoking in my house, and I don't appreciate having 
an antique incense burner used as an ashtray,'' snaps Wes Westlund 
(David Strathairn), an embittered, prissy academic, to Kim Matthews 
(Caroleen Feeney), his seductive chain-smoking house guest, in Jonathan 
Kaufer's pitch-black comedy ``Bad Manners.'' Kim is a piece of work 
by any definition. A game theorist and computer scientist accompanying 
her musicologist-boyfriend, Matt Carroll (Saul Rubinek), to Cambridge, 
Mass., she sees all human relations as a diabolical power game. It 
isn't long before she is cruelly pelting Wes and his sexually unfulfilled 
wife, Nancy (Bonnie Bedelia), with humiliating questions about why 
they don't have any children. What are these four people doing in 
the same house together? Well, many years ago, Matt and Nancy were 
a couple. Now Matt, who has since gained 40 pounds, has returned to 
Cambridge with Kim to give a lecture and meet with an editor about 
the publication of his exciting new research on the work of a Vietnamese 
electronic composer. Matt is beside himself with excitement after 
having discovered a fragment of ``A Mighty Fortress Is Our God'' buried 
in the fabric of one of his pet composer's randomly determined electronic 
compositions. How did it get there? Was it an accident? Did God miraculously 
place it there? Or was the software program used to produce the piece 
somehow tampered with? The mystery of the hidden musical quote coincides 
with a more mundane and mean-spirited drama that torments this unhappy 
foursome during their weekend in hell together. After his first clash 
with Kim, Wes discovers a $50 bill missing from his wallet. He is 
so certain that she stole it that he pressures his wife to rummage 
through Kim's luggage, where Nancy indeed discovers such a bill secreted 
in a compact. But is it the same bill? That's only the beginning of 
the sophisticated truth-or-dare inspired games of accusation and denial 
that the two couples play with the intensity of high-stakes poker 
players. Why these people would choose to spend more than half an 
hour, let alone an entire weekend, in one another's company after 
the first salvos have been fired is anybody's guess. But if they didn't 
obsessively try to outsmart one another, there would be no movie. 
By the end of the film, the stakes escalate from stolen $50 bills 
to the very foundations of trust on which their relationships are 
based. Comic viciousness and sexual and intellectual humiliation and 
one-upmanship are the sum and substance of this nasty parlor game 
of a film, adapted by David Gilman from his play ``Ghost in the Machine.'' 
Although the movie aspires to be a late-90's cyber-wise ``Who's Afraid 
of Virginia Woolf?,'' it lacks the overriding humanity of Edward Albee's 
scabrous orgy of booze-fueled insults and anguished truth-telling. 
People, not even those who spend 12 hours a day straining their eyes 
in front of a computer screen analyzing game theory, aren't this gratuitously 
vicious. ``Bad Manners'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying 
parent or guardian). It has sexual situations, nudity and strong language.
