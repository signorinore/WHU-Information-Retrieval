Widening the dewiest eyes this side of Bambi, Eddie Murphy turns up 
bald and beatific in ``Holy Man.'' Is he or isn't he the purest of 
beings, a sacred and unselfish soul? And what is his mission in this 
movie? If he is mostly here to provide much-needed wisdom to the crass 
television executive played by Jeff Goldblum, who has crassness down 
to a science, then ``Holy Man'' needs some spiritual enlightenment 
of its own. For all the funny possibilities of Murphy's neat transformation 
here, the latest comedy from Stephen Herek (``Bill and Ted's Excellent 
Adventure,'' ``The Mighty Ducks'') doesn't know what to do with him. 
After letting him carry on wittily in divine mode for a while, the 
film reduces him to a sunny sight gag and a catalyst for its other 
characters. When Eddie Murphy is on hand with as potentially inspired 
a bit as he's got here, losing track of him is a cardinal sin. Arguably, 
``Holy Man'' is intended as a satirical view of home-shopping sales 
pitches on television, the barn-size target that achieves satire so 
nicely all by itself. So once the slick yuppie Ricky Hayman (Goldblum) 
literally runs into Murphy with his sports car (one of endless product 
plugs in a movie about forsaking materialism), it's inevitable that 
the wise man and the wisenheimer will intersect on the airwaves. When 
Murphy's character, simply called G, starts imparting his thoughts 
to home shoppers, he somehow raises their consciousness while also 
encouraging them to buy. The screenplay by Tom Schulman, who wrote 
and directed ``Eight Heads in a Duffel Bag,'' hasn't a prayer of making 
sense of this. The home shopping snippets feature familiar pitch people 
(Willard Scott, Morgan Fairchild) and deliver dopey, winking gags. 
The quest for laughs doesn't take this material to a terribly high 
plane. Meanwhile, there's a cubic zirconium of a romance going on 
between Ricky and Kate Newell, another executive, that G is on hand 
to encourage. Kelly Preston plays Kate crisply enough to transcend 
the film's garish costumes and harsh lighting. Murphy arrives enjoyably 
at the start of the film, full of surprises. And he's able to create 
relative bliss under even the oddest circumstances. (For no discernible 
reason, a long scene at a party has him hypnotizing the clothing designer 
Nino Cerruti.) As G moves into Ricky's life, sleeping happily on the 
floor and dispensing advice, the audience had best not wait for the 
other shoe to drop. There isn't any. The film never really explains 
where G came from or where he's going. ``Holy Man'' is rated PG (Parental 
guidance suggested). It includes profanity, a brief sexual situation 
and smutty double-entendres on the home shopping front. PRODUCTION
