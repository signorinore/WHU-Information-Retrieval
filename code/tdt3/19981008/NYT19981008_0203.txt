Twenty-five years after it was first released, ``Detroit 9000'' _ 
with its tale of a womanizing Washington politician, campaign finance 
shenanigans, urban crime, suspicion and hostility between blacks and 
whites, and the moral question mark that hangs over its conclusion 
_ has attained the status of a valuable cultural gauge. Even the reason 
it is being reviewed now says something about life and attitudes toward 
race and film in these United States. ``Detroit 9000'' revolves around 
a theft of $400,000 in jewelry and cash at a formal-dress fund-raiser 
among black supporters of a black congressman eyeing the Michigan 
governorship. When made in 1973, the movie was classified as a blaxploitation 
film intended primarily for black audiences and was consigned mainly 
to the black theater circuit. Resurrected by Quentin Tarantino's Rolling 
Thunder Company, ``Detroit 9000'' is an intriguing artifact. With 
its soul music, 1970s fashions and evocation of the bleak atmosphere 
hanging over Detroit, where it was filmed with the considerable cooperation 
of the police, the film remains freighted with some of the hopelessness 
that pervaded so many crime-ridden and devastated inner cities at 
the time. As an example of the genre the French call a policier, the 
film is unexceptional. A familiar odd-couple pairing of detectives, 
one white, one black, is assigned to solve a high-profile robbery 
of prominent blacks at the downtown hotel ballroom fund-raiser for 
Rep. Aubrey Hale Clayton (Rudy Challenger) on the night he has declared 
his intention to run for the statehouse. Nothing exceptional characterizes 
the sleuthing in ``Detroit 9000'' _ the 9000 is code for an officer's 
distress call _ and at times the plotting does not bear intense scrutiny. 
But as written by Orville Hampton and produced and directed by Arthur 
Marks, the film rides on the edgy relationships between blacks and 
whites in general, and in particular between the two police officers 
at its center. The white officer, Lt. Danny Bassett, is played by 
Alex Rocco, perhaps best known to filmgoers as Moe Green, who meets 
a memorable end, shot through eyeglass lens and eye in ``The Godfather.'' 
Bassett is a classic street cop, known for his ability and honesty, 
and resentful of being denied the promotion that went to the officer 
who assigns him the case and pressures him to solve it in a hurry. 
That officer went to school to advance his career while Bassett remained 
on the street, and he reminds Bassett that times are changing. Bassett 
is no diplomat. Reporters are pressing to know whether the crime was 
a case of blacks ripping off blacks or whites determined to keep a 
black man from high office. Bassett really doesn't care to pander 
to anyone's preconceptions about the race of the criminals. All he 
wants to do is catch them. In the background of Bassett's life is 
a mentally disturbed wife, spewing racial and ethnic bigotry from 
a wheelchair in a public mental institution, which absorbs a good 
deal of Bassett's income. The black detective, Sgt. Jesse Williams 
(Hari Rhodes), could be a role model for role models. He is handsome, 
college educated, athletic, a good guy (he helps run basketball games 
at a boys' club) and so sexy that his girlfriend, who teaches at Wayne 
State University, can scarcely keep her hands off him. That he and 
Bassett never resolve their relationship, like the latter-day team 
of Danny Glover and Mel Gibson in the ``Lethal Weapon'' series, is 
telling. In general release, ``Detroit 9000'' illustrates the wisdom 
of the adage ``better late than never.'' ``Detroit 9000'' is rated 
R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes 
uninhibited language, bloody violence, partial nudity and simulated 
sex. PRODUCTION NOTES: DETROIT 9000 Produced and directed by Arthur
