NEW YORK _ ``Don't worry,'' coos the famous, successful, beautiful 
sister. ``I'm not laughing at you, I'm laughing with you.'' A look 
of dismay. ``But I'm not laughing,'' the other sister replies. It 
has taken only two films, ``Welcome to the Dollhouse'' and now ``Happiness,'' 
for Todd Solondz to establish his as one of the most lacerating, funny 
and distinctive voices in American film. In his hands, passive aggression 
is a deadly weapon, right there in the arsenal alongside perky suburban 
decor and easy-listening songs. (``Happiness'' deploys both ``You 
Light Up My Life'' and ``Mandy.'') Yet kitschy Americana does not 
apparently interest him as a target for sardonic potshots. It interests 
him as a matter of proportion. There are people out there who are 
more bothered when a child's Tamagotchi dies than when a clean-cut 
relative turns out to be a serial pederast. Solondz wants to know 
how they tick. In ``Happiness,'' a much bigger film than his first 
and another murderous comedy of manners, Solondz gets even closer 
to the bone. His natural tendency to make audiences squirm leads him 
into material that wouldn't be mentioned in many other films; here, 
it's linked to the eating of ice cream sundaes. But Solondz doesn't 
seem to be straining for shock value when he turns the man in the 
sunny family portrait on the wall into the man who drugs his family's 
dessert. (His purpose: an assault on the son's young friend.) He fills 
``Happiness'' with enough misery to make its most outrageous joke 
its title _ and with enough true, unexpected tenderness to warrant 
this view of the world. ``Happiness'' revolves around the lives of 
three sisters and observes their romantic lives with enough acid precision 
to make it a ``Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice'' for totally dysfunctional 
times. Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle) is the glamour girl, the celebrity 
writer who complains: ``I hate Saturday nights. Everybody wants me. 
You have no idea.'' One look at her and you're meant to hate her along 
with Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman), her timid neighbor. Allen makes 
obscene phone calls so furtively that one of the funniest things in 
the film is watching him try to switch gears and behave normally (``Seen 
the playoffs last night?'') with the guys at the office. Helen's sister 
Joy, played with hilarious tremulousness by Jane Adams, is the dartboard 
in a family that also includes chirpy Trish (Cynthia Stevenson). Trish 
looks as pert as her name suggests and has a wonderful time pitying 
Joy's single status. (``Just because you've hit 30 doesn't mean you 
can't be fresh any more!'') But the film, which also features Louise 
Lasser and Ben Gazzara as the suitably unhappy parents of this brood 
and Jon Lovitz and Jared Harris as the funniest of Joy's Wrongs, veers 
right out of situation comedy and into what was once the unspeakable 
when it gets to Trish's husband. He (Dylan Baker, in a brave and chilling 
performance) is known as Dr. Maplewood by the little boys who look 
up to him. In depicting this doctor, who lives a secret life of shame 
and prurience, and talks so matter of factly about male sexuality 
with his son (Rufus Read) that ``Happiness'' was dropped by its original 
distributor (October Films, owned by Universal Seagram), Solondz lives 
up to his growing reputation for shock value. There can be no more 
shocking view of the doctor than an understanding one. And in the 
same way he made viewers share the junior high school humiliations 
of ``Welcome to the Dollhouse,'' Solondz calmly draws his audience 
into sharing the doctor's ordeal. Not without humor, of course. When 
Dr. Maplewood tells his therapist that his latest dream of shooting 
up a public park ends without suicide, the therapist remarks, ``You 
see this as something positive?'' This sequence is shot with an imaginative 
crane maneuver by Maryse Alberti, who also gives such visual flair 
to Todd Haynes' ``Velvet Goldmine.'' It's a shot that pulls away from 
the doctor's bland exterior until it reaches parts unknown. This funny 
yet frightening film works the same way. ``Happiness,'' which could 
have gone with an NC-17 rating for its masturbation references alone, 
will be released wisely unrated when it opens commercially on Sunday. 
It will be shown Friday and Saturday as part of the New York Film 
Festival. PRODUCTION NOTES: `HAPPINESS' Written and directed by Todd
