This guy looks awfully familiar. Don't we know him from somewhere? 
Is it the yearbook pictures, the ones that show him with the Piper 
Cub Club or leading the beekeepers' society? Is it the way he wrote 
and directed the school's most unbearable plays? Isn't he the crossing 
guard who used his job to hit on friends' mothers? Remember how he 
gave the orders and outsmarted the teachers? Probably he has grown 
up to be a captain of industry and loves reminiscing about his hard 
climb to the top. This portrait of the mogul as a young man arrives 
courtesy of Wes Anderson, whose bright, spiky ``Rushmore'' has the 
brainstorm of envisioning a 15-year-old tycoon-wannabe as a schoolboy. 
At Rushmore Academy, in scenes filmed at the director's own Texas 
alma mater, horrid little Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) calls the 
shots. Oh, sure, the place has faculty, but none of the grown-ups 
has anything like Max's natural authority. Maybe one man on the scene, 
the steel tycoon and Rushmore benefactor played with all the right 
wiles by Bill Murray, is right on the same wavelength with Max. While 
the film embroils Max and the mogul in pursuit of the same beautiful 
teacher (Olivia Williams), it's a particular treat for its skewed, 
hilarious memories of a cutthroat boyhood. Bespectacled Max, who's 
as much of a sight gag for the wide-angle lens as he is a flesh-and-blood 
character, starts off on top of the Rushmore world and experiences 
a wonderfully welcome comeuppance. He's meant to be mellowing along 
the way, but ``Rushmore'' wouldn't dare turn sentimental about that. 
As directed by Anderson and written by him with Owen Wilson (his partner 
on ``Bottle Rocket,'' which ``Rushmore'' far surpasses), it's too 
smart to be maudlin. Far better to show off Max's Vietnam play, with 
real explosives (earplugs and safety glasses available) or let him 
boast derangedly (in one especially funny dinner scene) about having 
a hit to his credit. Casting notes about ``Rushmore,'' which also 
includes a sweet turn by Seymour Cassel as Max's father and a sputteringly 
indignant one from Brian Cox as the headmaster: Of the many who auditioned 
for Max's role, some actors spontaneously showed up in preppy looking 
blazers. But Schwartzman earned the part by among other things being 
the only one who actually made a fake Rushmore patch. And since Ms. 
Williams' only other theatrical film credit is appearing opposite 
Kevin Costner in ``The Postman,'' this amounts to her feature debut. 
Also on the same bill at the New York Film Festival is another delightful 
film about a rite of passage, Xavier Giannoli's 17-minute ``Interview.'' 
This rueful black-and-white French short presents a real story, and 
it's one that couldn't have been made up: a fledgling journalist's 
dream interview with his beloved Ava Gardner, and the learning experience 
this debacle became. The reporter is played wonderfully by Matthieu 
Amalric, also starring in ``Late August, Early September'' and looking 
more and more like his generation's Jean-Pierre Leaud. ``Rushmore'' 
and ``The Interview'' will be shown Friday night at 9:15 and Saturday 
at noon as part of the New York Film Festival. PRODUCTION NOTES: `RUSHMORE'
