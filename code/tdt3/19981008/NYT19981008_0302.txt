Phillips Petroleum Co. and Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp. agreed 
Thursday to combine their gas station chains and refineries into a 
joint-venture company called Diamond 66. The move is expected to save 
more than $250 million a year, starting in the second year, and will 
eliminate 1,000 jobs from the companies' combined work force of 29,000. 
Diamond 66 is expected to have revenues of $20 billion. Ultramar Diamond 
Shamrock, based in San Antonio, will own 55 percent and Phillips, 
based in Bartlesville, Okla., will own 45 percent of Diamond 66. Phillips 
will receive a cash payment of $500 million when the deal is closed 
and another $300 million one year later. Diamond 66 will run 10 refineries 
and have more than 12,000 gas stations in 36 states, mostly in the 
Southwest, Midwest, the West Coast and six Canadian provinces. It 
will account for about 9 percent of the nation's gasoline market and 
be the nation's largest independent refiner. Wayne Allen, the chairman 
and chief executive of Phillips, said the deal had been in the works 
for some time as his company sought greater efficiency in refining. 
Recent mergers and joint ventures are putting pressure on the smaller 
and less efficient refiners. For years the refining industry has been 
plagued by overcapacity, but that has changed greatly recently. For 
most of this year, refineries have run at full capacity to meet the 
strong demand for gasoline. Refiners have also improved their profitability. 
For a while this year, they benefited as crude oil prices dropped, 
while the fall in prices of retail gasoline was less rapid. Ultramar 
Diamond Shamrock was formed in 1996 from the merger of two refining 
companies, in a move to cut costs and increase efficiency. Shares 
of Phillips closed at $45.375 Thursday, down $1.25, while Ultramar 
rose 31.25 cents, to $23, on the New York Stock Exchange. As have 
most of the medium-sized oil companies, Phillips has been seeking 
to find a way to enter the race to develop the huge fields in the 
Caspian Sea region and in Russia, projects that will require huge 
spending. Last month Phillips joined with Inpex of Japan in paying 
$500 million to the government of Kazakhstan for drilling rights in 
the Caspian Sea. Earlier this year, when Shell, Texaco and Aramco 
of Saudi Arabia merged their refining and marketing operations on 
the East Coast of the United States, Shell and Texaco also merged 
their West Coast refining business. The two alliances now hold about 
14 percent of the nation's gasoline market.
