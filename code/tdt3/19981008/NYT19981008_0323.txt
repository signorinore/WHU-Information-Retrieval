In the privacy of his office, a powerful officeholder asks an attractive 
young woman for sex. Why on earth does this sound so familiar? Well, 
maybe because it sets in motion the strange events of ``Measure for 
Measure,'' Shakespeare's dark fable of lust and punishment. The setting 
here, of course, is Vienna, not Washington, and though Angelo, the 
sinning deputy, must account for his indecent proposals in a humiliating 
public session, he's never actually called upon outright to provide 
his own definition of ``sexual relations.'' Still, as underscored 
in Target Margin Theater's radical restaging of the play, the parallels 
to current events are striking. ``Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite,'' 
Angelo (Andrew Dolan) demands of Isabella (Sheri Graubert). In this 
instance, however, it's a woman's refusal to submit that exposes a 
man to accusations of corruption and abuse of power, charges that 
lead to the kind of public act of contrition that might even satisfy 
the table-pounding cadres of commentators on MSNBC. ``So deep sticks 
it in my penitent heart,'' Angelo declares at the end, ``that I crave 
death more willingly than mercy.'' Now, that's a mea culpa. Target 
Margin, a 7-year-old Off Off Broadway company that runs the classics 
through a postmodernist filter, has had considerable success in recent 
years with reconsiderations of fascinating, forgotten old plays like 
Julian Green's ``South'' and, especially, Dorothy and DuBose Heyward's 
``Mamba's Daughters.'' Guided by the director David Herskovits, the 
company has developed a signature style, that is to say, a pastiche 
approach that borrows from other theatrical traditions and cultures. 
Actors stain and tattoo their faces, model costumes both modern and 
classical, and declaim artificially, all flourishes intended to redesign 
a play for the contemporary eye and ear. The conceits work wonderfully 
well in many instances, particularly when Herskovits' embellishments 
underscore a society's changing values, as in the homosexual undercurrents 
in ``South'' or the subtleties of dialogue and race in ``Mamba's Daughters.'' 
But in ``Measure for Measure'' at the Cornelia Connelly Theater, the 
director's tinkering affords fewer rewards. Perhaps it is the company's 
unpleasant run-ins with Elizabethan language; aside from Ms. Graubert, 
who is an immaculate and appealing Isabella, the actors are not very 
successful with Shakespeare's verse. Since Herskovits' twists and 
turns are so dependent on irony, a lack of verbal dexterity imposes 
stringent limitations on what he is able to accomplish. The best scenes 
_ as is often the case with this talented director _ are the one-on-ones. 
Ms. Graubert and Dolan are well matched in the juicy set-tos wherein 
Isabella rebuffs Angelo's moves. There is, however, a lot of posing 
of groups of otherwise uninvolved actors that confuses rather than 
embroiders the plot; the production is affected and stagey, in a dilettantish 
way. It's freshness without the flavor. PRODUCTION NOTES: `MEASURE
