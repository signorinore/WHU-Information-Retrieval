In this status-obsessed city, where Rolls-Royces and Rolexes seem 
to outnumber Toyotas and Timexes, the most prized of all possessions 
these days is a 75-cent plastic beagle. Every day since Sept. 11, 
McDonald's has sold a new Snoopy figure, dressed in different national 
costume, as part of a monthlong marketing campaign. And with each 
day, the stampede to buy these toys has gathered force _ turning a 
fad into a phenomenon and, ultimately, into a public safety hazard. 
On Tuesday, the Hong Kong police had to break up scuffles among tens 
of thousands of people who lined up _ many of them overnight _ in 
front of the city's 147 McDonald's restaurants to buy the ``Hong Kong'' 
Snoopy, a sturdy little fisherman clad in a yellow rain slicker and 
holding his daily catch. Members of Hong Kong's legislature demanded 
that the restaurant chain halt the promotion because it was provoking 
unruly scenes outside the restaurants. McDonald's has recently tried 
to defuse the criticism by allowing customers to order an unlimited 
number of Snoopy toys through the mail. ``People have just gone crazy,'' 
a well-dressed woman said as she waited restlessly outside a McDonald's, 
alongside stockbrokers, department-store clerks, household servants, 
college students and even some children. So pervasive is beagle-mania 
here that it has managed to trivialize even the most solemn of civic 
rituals. When Hong Kong celebrated China's National Day last week, 
there was more talk about the Golden Arches, where crowds flocked 
to buy the ``China'' Snoopy, than about the Gate of Heavenly Peace, 
where Mao proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic on Oct. 
1, 1949. Fads are nothing new in Hong Kong, where the crowded living 
conditions and a gregarious population make it a hothouse for all 
sorts of trends. But the scale and nature of this fad has caught social 
observers by surprise. For one thing, people here normally pitch their 
consumer obsessions a bit higher. Last spring, for example, Hong Kong 
people lined up by the thousands to buy shares in ``red chips,'' mainland 
Chinese-owned companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. And 
in the fall, they besieged a fancy cake shop, after rumors circulated 
that it was about to close. Never, though, have so many upscale consumers 
turned cartwheels over something so resolutely mass market. ``Frankly, 
I'm baffled,'' said Michael Bond, a professor of psychology at Chinese 
University in Hong Kong. ``The texture of these Snoopy toys isn't 
particularly appealing, the shape isn't particularly appealing. I 
guess nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the public.'' 
Others say the Snoopy craze is merely the latest sign of Asia's economic 
distress. At a time when the recession has hammered Hong Kong's stock 
market, property market and even its race track, these brightly colored, 
three-inch beagles have become a low-cost outlet for people's consumer 
appetites. ``The Snoopy costs very little, but it represents something 
_ a status symbol,'' said Peter Tsoi, a local psychiatrist. But economic 
misery alone does not explain it. Mcdonald's has run the same campaign 
in Thailand, Taiwan and Singapore, where it was popular but scarcely 
a sensation. The company said it would start the campaign in Japan 
soon and was considering whether to bring it to the United States. 
Demand here is so intense that it has spawned a lively black market. 
Dealers loitered outside a McDonald's in central Hong Kong on a recent 
morning, haggling over particularly coveted Snoopys, like the ones 
representing China, Britain and the United States. The most sought-after 
Snoopy _ a sombrero-wearing Mexican _ commands nearly $40 at markets 
in the teeming neighborhood of Mongkok. ``Whenever people can smell 
a black market, they will come out in droves,'' said Thomas Wong, 
a 36-year-old employee at a finance company, who stood in line with 
his wife. ``That is especially true during a recession.'' Despite 
his financial bent, Wong insisted he was collecting the Snoopy toys 
purely for pleasure. And he said he doubted that the figures would 
have enduring value once the promotion ended on Thursday. Still, the 
growing black market has exposed McDonald's to criticism. The company 
has declined to say how many Snoopys it has sold or how many it has 
in stock, which has further inflated their perceived value. Until 
last week, when mail-in orders for the Snoopys were announced, customers 
could only buy a single toy by lining up to purchase a burger, french 
fries and a soft drink. But because they could also buy up to five 
meals at a time, many were emerging from McDonald's laden down with 
plastic bags. ``We don't want long lines,'' said Mayee Tang, a spokeswoman 
for McDonald's. ``People are lining up overnight. We're very concerned 
about safety in our restaurants. People are also really aggressive.'' 
Among those lining up on a recent morning, however, the mood was more 
sheepish than surly. A well-dressed young man reading The Asian Wall 
Street Journal waved away a reporter without lifting his eyes from 
the paper. Several people argued that Snoopy offered valuable lessons 
about other cultures. And still others insisted they were only buying 
them for their children. ``This doesn't reflect the craziness of Chinese 
people, but the desire of parents to satisfy their kids,'' said a 
woman who identified herself only as Mrs. Tam, and was on her 10th 
consecutive day of lining up to buy a beagle.
