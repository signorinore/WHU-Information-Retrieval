Citigroup Inc., the financial services giant formed by the newly combined 
Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc., said Thursday that it would report 
an estimated $700 million of net income for the three months ended 
on Sept. 30 after being hit by about $1 billion in losses from the 
recent turmoil in financial markets. That estimate for third-quarter 
earnings compares with $1.5 billion in combined net income for the 
two independent companies in the period a year earlier, or $2.1 billion 
of combined net income before allowing for a reorganization charge. 
Since the two huge financial companies announced their intention to 
merge in April to form the nation's biggest banking, insurance and 
investment conglomerate, the combined value of Citigroup has fallen 
more than 50 percent, to an estimated $72 billion, as financial markets 
have been roiled by Russia's default, Japan's continuing economic 
problems, President Clinton's troubles and most recently by the near-collapse 
of Long-Term Capital Management, the big hedge fund in Greenwich, 
Conn. Citigroup said Thursday that Salomon Smith Barney, its investment 
bank, would report a net loss of about $325 million for the third 
quarter. These losses, it said, were caused by a $700 million loss 
in the firm's global arbitrage business and from credit losses related 
to Russia. Salomon, which said on Aug. 31 that its losses for July 
and August totaled $150 million, was one of the first financial companies 
to warn investors of the growing losses caused by volatile market 
conditions since mid-July. In addition, Citigroup said that its Citibank 
subsidiary would report a $130 million loss in its corporate banking 
business because of about $240 million of after-tax losses related 
to Russia and about $100 million in after-tax losses related to the 
decline in the value of its bond holdings. Despite these losses, the 
company said its consumer banking and insurance businesses continued 
to do well. After the stream of bad news from financial companies 
in recent weeks, analysts seemed to take Citigroup's announcement 
in stride, as did the market: shares of Citigroup rose 75 cents, to 
$32.50. ``The earnings were a little lower than we expected,'' said 
Ronald Mandle, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein &AMP; Co. ``The real 
shift is that they are moving to reduce risk throughout the company. 
The consumer business is performing very well. I think earnings will 
be considerably better in the fourth quarter.'' John Keefe, an analyst 
at Keefe Worldwide Financial Services, a New York consulting firm, 
said: ``It's not atypical to use a combining quarter like this to 
do the wash. Unfortunately in this quarter there's plenty of laundry 
to do.'' Citigroup is expected to report third-quarter earnings in 
the next few weeks. Richard Strauss, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs 
&AMP; Co., who recently cut his estimates for the company, said: ``Definitely 
the weakness at Salomon was meaningfully worse than anticipated. What 
we are more likely to see in the third quarter is downside and not 
upside.'' Nevertheless, Citigroup's two co-chairmen and co-chief executives, 
John Reed and Sanford Weill, tried in an interview Thursday _ the 
first day of trading for the stock of Citigroup _ to put a brave face 
on their future together, stressing that this was a merger with good 
long-term prospects whatever recent market volatility might have done 
to their company's stock price. They also said they did not envision 
making layoffs. Weill maintained that despite the current uncertainties 
in financial markets there were ``incredible opportunities to grow 
one's business,'' even though ``every now and again,'' the financial 
markets might be upset by ``vicious cycles.'' Ticking off the travails 
the markets face: falling stock values, Russia, Long-Term Capital 
and other difficulties, Weill said, ``We have the ability to withstand 
that.'' The financial leaders defended their combined company's part 
in the recent $3.65 billion rescue of Long-Term Capital. ``I believe 
that the industry coming together with a private-sector investment 
in Long-Term Capital was in the long-term interests of the capital 
markets,'' Weill said. Travelers, which put up $300 million as part 
of that rescue, has an executive on the team overseeing Long-Term 
Capital as it tries to work itself out of its multibillion-dollar 
difficulties. That may take some time. ``What's happened to our investment? 
I don't know, but I don't think it's up,'' Weill said with a laugh. 
Both men said they did not have any of their own money in the fund. 
They also seemed concerned about Brazil's economic and financial difficulties 
and gave some insight into how they work together. ``I'm quite interested 
with how we're going to deal with the pressure on Brazil,'' Reed said. 
``Mexico was dealt with in one way, Russia in another. The market 
is confused. What the market is looking for is for a pattern to emerge.'' 
He wondered ``as to how this pressure on Brazil will be dissipated. 
You can't have a developing country with interest rates at 50 percent,'' 
for a long period, he said. ``Just remember. Anything you say, on 
Wednesday I'll have to defend it,'' Weill interjected with a smile, 
referring to his forthcoming trip to Brazil. That's how things have 
to work at a company with two chairmen.
