President Clinton maintained an ordinary schedule and an air of absorption 
Thursday in routine public business as the House approved an impeachment 
investigation that might shorten his term in office and would certainly 
affect his place in history. Clinton announced measures to protect 
Medicare recipients dropped from their health plans, warned of a looming 
refugee catastrophe in Kosovo, lunched with Vice President Al Gore, 
signed a bill to publish records of Nazi war criminals and met with 
his economic advisers on the 1999 budget. In his only remarks on the 
impeachment vote, Clinton told reporters in a brief picture-taking 
session late Thursday afternoon that his future was ``not in my hands.'' 
``Ultimately it is in the hands of the Congress,'' Clinton said Thursday. 
``I don't think it's appropriate to comment further today.'' Thursday 
morning, as the House was engaged in its wrenching debate over the 
impeachment inquiry, Clinton was before a friendly audience in the 
Roosevelt Room of the White House discussing Medicare and health maintenance 
organizations. As he completed his remarks, reporters tried to shout 
questions about the impeachment debate and the hearings that were 
likely to begin shortly after the Nov. 3 election. Their entreaties 
were drowned out by applause from a carefully selected audience of 
Democratic lawmakers, administration officials and senior citizens. 
The end of the official transcript of the event reads: ``Mr. President, 
will you voluntarily testify?'' He offered no response as he left 
the room. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton had not 
watched any of the House debate on the impeachment inquiry, unless 
he caught glimpses of it on one of the dozens of television sets in 
the West Wing tuned to the proceedings. ``I don't believe he's watched 
any of it, unless he's watched it in passing, walking through a hallway,'' 
Lockhart said. ``He is surely interested in the outcome, but he's 
got a job to do here, and that's what he's focused on.'' Lockhart 
added: ``We don't have the luxury of being distracted or being anyplace 
else. We have the people's business to do here, and in fact, that's 
what's happening over the next few days.'' A senior White House official 
said the only suspense about Thursday's impeachment vote was the number 
of Democrats who would vote for the Republican impeachment resolution, 
and even that number was pretty well known on Wednesday night. House 
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri told the White House on 
the eve of the vote that he expected about 30 Democrats, some in tight 
re-election races, to defect and join the Republicans. Thirty-one 
Democrats voted for the Republican resolution. The president's apparent 
nonchalance was the result of this early intelligence, the White House 
official said. ``This thing got built up bigger than it needed or 
should have been,'' the official said. ``We're talking about a process 
that we kind of knew the outcome of for a long time.'' Lockhart said 
throughout his regular briefing this afternoon that the president 
remained focused on important matters of state _ the federal budget, 
the crisis in Kosovo, the future of Social Security. Lockhart was 
asked whether there would ever come a time when the president would 
shift his focus from these matters to his personal survival. ``I don't 
know how to answer that,'' Lockhart replied.
