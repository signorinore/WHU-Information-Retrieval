Only in America could the House debate authorizing an impeachment 
investigation of President Clinton juxtapose quotations of the Founding 
Fathers with those of the wayward daughter, Monica Lewinsky. ``No 
one ever asked me to lie!'' Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury testimony rang 
out in the debating chamber, read loudly by a Clinton supporter in 
a warning of woeful things to come as Republicans pushed through their 
resolution for an open-ended impeachment investigation. There was 
a hush of exasperation in some corners of the House at the very mention 
of the name of Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House intern who, even 
before the vote, Republicans were vowing to call to Capitol Hill to 
re-tell her tale of an intimate affair with the president and their 
failed cover-up. ``Do we really want two more years of Monica Lewinsky?'' 
asked Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic whip, drawing 
instant groans from his partisans as he excoriated ``this daily mudslide 
into the nation's living rooms.'' ``Two more years of Linda Tripp?'' 
he asked and, even in the citizens' gallery, up above the agonizing 
Democrats and the triumphant Republicans, a few head-shaking ``no's'' 
could be seen. ``The American people don't want this,'' Joy Fugazi, 
a tourist from Lexington, Ky., fervidly insisted minutes later outside 
the gallery, still mesmerized by the wide-eyed spectacle of self-government 
she and the nation had just witnessed _ the House of Representatives 
targeting the president himself for investigation and possible removal 
from office. ``Ben Franklin described it as an alternative to assassination,'' 
Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., said ominously even as Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, 
R-Fla., exulted: ``The world marvels that our president is not above 
the law!'' Republicans stressed that it was Clinton himself who put 
the Democrats in their predicament of having to denounce his behavior 
even as they argued that it does not merit impeachment. ``The president 
is the trustee of the nation's conscience,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde, 
R-Ill., who led the debate as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. 
Lawyerly citations abounded amid the partisan cut-and-thrust. Rep. 
Bob Barr, R-Ga., who dedicated more than a year to the President's 
impeachment, sounded gleeful in citing ``no less a constitutional 
scholar than William Jefferson Clinton'' as having argued as a law 
professor in the Watergate era that any ``willful reckless behavior 
in office'' was impeachable. It was a rugged, at times scathing, debate, 
with Democrats emboldened to upbraid Speaker Newt Gingrich, who was 
up in the chair presiding. Last year he was reprimanded and treated 
far more gently by House Republicans for his own ethical transgressions, 
Democrats complained, in comparison to the trauma Clinton faces in 
the looming struggle. ``Reject this double Republican standard which 
exalts the speaker and moves to impeach the president,'' said Rep. 
Nancy Pelosi of California, drawing cheers from the Democrats. ``Who 
has not sinned?'' came the cry at one point as the Democrats argued 
that the issue was more about sex than perjury. ``Regular order!'' 
responded the Republicans, demanding a tight gavel and driving the 
impeachment motion to a vote. The tally included 31 Democrats wary 
of facing the voters next month without some cover after the Democratic 
alternative for a limited impeachment inquiry had failed. ``Beware 
the wrath of the American public!'' growled Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., 
glaring at the Republicans. Off the floor, Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., 
on the Judiciary Committee, easily conceded, ``Yeah, we've all got 
a tiger by the tail.'' But he added that only a full factual investigation, 
not some mere rubber stamping of the allegations of the Office of 
the Independent Counsel, can certify the inquiry as fair in the eyes 
of future generations. The debate at least established that there 
is no longer much argument left in the Republicans about whether President 
Richard Nixon was, after all, guilty. One Republican warned that failing 
to confront Clinton for lying under oath ``will be a return to the 
imperial presidency of the Nixon era, where the White House felt that 
the laws did not apply to them.'' Underlying the debate, the mood 
was almost casual on the Republican sidelines, with predictions offered 
that charges of impeachment will surely be voted next year. ``I think 
it's headed to the Senate,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who wandered 
over to the House in a mood of quiet expectation. The Democrats, even 
as they voted for a limited inquiry, could only warn about the public's 
intolerance of further doses of Ms. Lewinsky, uttering her name as 
if it were a imprecation and envisioning torpid weeks of the civic 
agenda filled with her ``stupid telephone chatter.'' ``The global 
economy is crumbling and we're talking about Monica Lewinsky!'' keened 
Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla. Attempting belittlement, Rep. James Traficant, 
D-Ohio, tailored the great Watergate question to Clinton's Lewinsky 
affair. But Traficant touched off one of the few bipartisan touches 
of the debate, general laughter, as his surreal query hung in the 
air: ``What did the president do with an intern, and when did he know 
that he did it?''
