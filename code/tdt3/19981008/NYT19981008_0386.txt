Seeking to end damaging party quarrels and bolster his own unproven 
leadership, William Hague told Conservatives Thursday that they had 
to be tough with the Labor government of Prime Minister Tony Blair. 
``It's time to take off the gloves and punch our weight,'' Hague said 
in a speech notable more for its philosophy than specific proposals. 
He laid out a ``British way'' to combat Blair's vaunted ``third way.'' 
And on the issue that has divided the party and the conference, he 
said, ``The British way is to be in Europe but not run by Europe.'' 
The Conservatives, he said, had to become known as ``the party of 
personal liberty'' to provide favorable contrast to the ``bossy'' 
Labor Party, which, he argued, is turning Britain into ``a nanny state.'' 
He said that his party had learned the need to ``listen to Britain'' 
from its trouncing in the last election and that party workers now 
reported a falloff in the ``the old hostility that greeted us on the 
doorstep.'' He acknowledged that the party had yet to turn that into 
enthusiasm, saying that was the mission before them. In the weeks 
before the conference, Hague tried to put an end to squabbling over 
Europe by holding a ballot of party members and announcing the verdict 
on the eve of the gathering. The referendum asked whether they supported 
Hague's position of keeping Britain out of the European single currency 
for at least the next eight years. He obtained the electoral results 
he wanted _ 84 percent of the voters endorsed his policy _ but not 
the results he sought for party peace. Although Hague said the outcome 
proved that his view was now ``the settled will'' of the party, opponents 
argued that the turnout was only 58 percent and that, therefore, the 
support for the policy among all party members amounted to less than 
half, or 49.6 percent. More critically for the party prospects for 
unity, some major Conservative figures with broad popularity and tested 
experience in the party assailed the policy and said they would continue 
to. Chief among them were Michael Heseltine, the deputy prime minister 
under John Major and Kenneth Clarke, former chancellor of the Exchequer. 
Europe is an issue that dogged the Tories through the last of their 
18 years in government and produced the disarray that contributed 
to the size of their defeat in the election of May 1, 1997. That was 
the worst loss for the Conservatives since 1832, costing the party 
all its seats in Scotland and Wales and delivering a 179-member parliamentary 
majority to Labor. Blair kept Britain out of the first wave of 11 
nations that are entering the monetary union but has broadly hinted 
that if conditions are favorable the country will sign up at the second 
entry point, expected in 2002. A strong undercurrent ran through the 
four-day conference over whether Hague, clever and congenial but so 
far unconvincing, was proving to be a leader of the stature to pull 
the depleted and dispirited Conservatives back into power. As the 
conference opened on Tuesday, a Gallup poll in The Daily Telegraph 
showed the Conservatives with the support of 23 percent of the electorate, 
down from its already dismal 31 percent in the election, and Labor 
at 57 percent, 13 points higher than its total then. Hague, 37, is 
the youngest party leader since 24-year-old William Pitt led the Tories 
in 1783. But he is a more experienced observer of British politics 
than his age and his stint of only three years in Major's Cabinet 
would suggest. In seeking to stress unity the conference brought to 
the stage two former prime ministers, Edward Heath and Margaret Thatcher, 
who have carried on a personal vendetta in the 22 years since the 
latter replaced the former as party leader. They have not exchanged 
a word in all that time, and they remained separated and silent in 
back-to-back armchairs throughout their appearance. The display underlined 
the division in the party, as Mrs. Thatcher, an opponent of further 
integration with Europe, gleefully applauded speakers who pledged 
to protect the pound, and Heath, an advocate of closer ties to Europe, 
kept his hands folded in his lap.
