Foreign-exchange traders battered the dollar into what looked like 
a second consecutive free fall Thursday before the currency abruptly 
reversed course, ending only slightly lower against the Japanese yen 
in extraordinarily volatile dealings. On Wednesday, the dollar registered 
its biggest one-day drop against the yen in a quarter century, losing 
more than 8 percent of its value. There was little movement between 
the currencies during overnight trading in Tokyo, but when European 
markets opened the dollar again came under attack, plunging as much 
as 7 percent, to a low of 111.73 yen, a level last seen in early June 
1997. Selling slowed and then turned during the afternoon in New York, 
and by late in the day the dollar was quoted at 119.05 yen, down from 
120.25 yen late Wednesday. ``This has been about the craziest day 
my colleagues and I have ever seen,'' said Jeremy Fand, senior foreign 
exchange strategist at BankBoston. ``But in spite of this we are optimistic, 
because we seem to have gotten rid of the speculative excess that 
was in the system.'' As on Wednesday, traders said much of the selling 
was done by large speculative hedge funds unwinding positions they 
had taken based on a bet that the yen would remain weak. And the impact 
of those sales was magnified because trading volume was quite light 
Thursday, Fand and others said. ``The market has been very quiet,'' 
said Michael Rosenberg, manager of currency and international fixed-income 
research at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``There is no liquidity in this 
market, and no appetite for risk in this sort of a chaotic situation.'' 
Traders said the dollar's slide slowed and then reversed after the 
trading desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began calling 
currency dealers to ask about conditions in the market. The New York 
Fed, which has operational control of the government's day-to-day 
dealings in the foreign exchange market, makes such calls when conditions 
appear unsettled. But some traders interpreted the inquiries as a 
possible sign that the Fed might be preparing to buy dollars to send 
a message that the United States wants the dollar to stabilize. In 
addition, Fand said traders were encouraged by news bulletins suggesting 
that a rescue package for Brazil was in the process of being assembled, 
and that Congress, after much delay, may be close to approving an 
$18 billion increase in funds for the International Monetary Fund. 
Perhaps most important, there was a recognition that the dollar had 
fallen much too steeply and much too fast against the yen, especially 
considering recent predictions that the dollar could reach 160 yen 
by the end of the year. ``Enough is enough,'' Fand said. ``What had 
happened was an obscene level of a correction for a two-day period. 
There are clearly buyers of dollars with the dollar between 110 yen 
and 115 yen.'' Rosenberg seemed to share the view that the dollar's 
wild gyrations against the yen were effectively over. Over the coming 
weeks and months, he said he expected the dollar to move higher against 
the yen. ``We need to build a base where the dollar trades between 
115 yen and 125 yen,'' he said. ``I think that will be the range for 
the next few weeks. After that, we think the dollar will gradually 
appreciate against the yen,'' perhaps to as high as 170. News that 
a financial rescue package for Brazil was being assembled also helped 
push the dollar up against the German mark and other major currencies. 
Late Thursday, the dollar was trading at 1.6375 German marks, up from 
1.6138 marks on Wednesday. ``Without any doubt, this last week was 
a turning point for financial markets,'' Fand said. ``The message 
has been conveyed that a line has been drawn in the sand, and that 
emerging markets will not be allowed to bleed any more. If Brazil 
is going to be saved and the IMF is going to get its funding, the 
world has to have some renewed confidence that this is the end of 
the financial crisis.''
