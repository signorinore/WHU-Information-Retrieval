Basically, two winning themes emerged in a quarter so dismal that 
gains of less than 2 percent could catapult a mutual fund into the 
top 10 among domestic diversified stock funds: plays on falling interest 
rates, and an overall search for safety. The Vanguard Wellesley Income 
fund, with a combination of stocks and bonds that neatly tied together 
both themes, ranked seventh among diversified domestic stock funds; 
its quarterly return was 1.65 percent. Many of its stocks are utilities, 
which have come into their own after struggling in red-hot markets. 
Another winner, the Copley Fund, took 10th place with a return of 
0.97 percent, also helped by a heavy weighting of utility shares. 
Among purer plays, Strong American Utilities, up 4.89 percent, ranked 
fourth among specialized funds. And a newfangled investment, Barr 
Rosenberg Market Neutral, ranked sixth among diversified funds, with 
a return of 1.9 percent. It aims for a steady return regardless of 
what happens in the market. The managers of the four funds talked 
about how they coped and what might lie ahead. ``We've had a good 
portfolio all along,'' said William H. Reaves, who runs Strong American 
Utilities, with $216.5 million in assets. ``We've just come into a 
period when the sun is shining on our stocks for a change.'' Among 
the fund's holdings are shares in electric utilities (38.5 percent), 
telecommunications (34 percent), energy (13 percent) and gas utilities 
(8 percent). The climate for utilities stocks has been particularly 
good, he said, because the slowing earnings growth trend of industrial 
companies and falling interest rates have made the dividends paid 
by utilities companies more attractive. As of Sept. 30, the fund yielded 
2.44 percent. Reaves said he had been building his position in electric 
utility stocks throughout the year, ``as the deregulation process 
moves along in state after state.'' One favorite is Ameren, now 7 
percent of the fund's portfolio. Ameren, based in St. Louis, yields 
6 percent. Another large holding, 7.1 percent of the portfolio, is 
Nipsco, a natural-gas and electric company based in Merrillville, 
Ind. ``We see good dividend growth and 8 percent per-share earnings 
growth over the next three years,'' Reaves said. In telecommunications, 
his largest position is Ameritech (8.1 percent of the portfolio). 
``We expect dividend payments to increase about 6 percent a year, 
and earnings per share at 12 percent,'' he said. Other favorites: 
Bell Atlantic (7.2 percent) and the SBC Corp. (6.6 percent). Reaves 
expects the good times to continue for utilities ``as long as we have 
slow growth and until the trend of interest rates turns up.'' Barr 
Rosenberg Market Neutral, with $310 million in assets, has also been 
shining. William Jump, the portfolio engineer, aims to buy stocks 
he thinks are undervalued and then ``neutralize'' the risk by selling 
short (that is, selling borrowed shares of) an equal amount of stocks 
he sees as overvalued. If the prices of the shorted stocks fall, as 
expected, the borrowed securities can be replaced with shares that 
cost less. Over all, the combination is intended to produce a fund 
with the same risk levels as intermediate bonds, but with higher returns. 
``Our goal is to beat Treasury bills by 5{ percent to 6 percent a 
year, which is about 10 or 11 percent in the current interest-rate 
environment,'' Jump said.
