In a ``B'' movie, BMW would stitch together the M Coupe on a dark 
and menacing night as lightning crackled against a castle in deepest 
Bavaria. Slightly mad scientists would scurry among test tubes and 
shelves of body parts. Grave robbers would rush in with a fearsome 
heart _ a 3.2-liter straight six purloined from the M works down the 
road. A bulbous top would be planted on the curvaceous body of a Z3 
roadster. At midnight, Dr. Burkhard Goschel, a BMW product manager, 
would pull a lever and sparks would fly as 240 horsepower rumbled 
through four exhaust tips. Engineers would recoil in horror. It's 
alive! But what on earth have they created? Only the fastest car BMW 
has ever sold in the United States, a $42,370 Go Kart with two sport 
seats and room for two golf bags, with the kind of razor-edged maneuverability 
that Scott Doniger, the company's M brand manager, likened to ``a 
four-wheeled motorcycle.'' But compared with the shapely M Roadster, 
the M Coupe is a wide-eyed hunchback _ think of Marty Feldman in ``Young 
Frankenstein,'' but with Carl Lewis' reflexes. It is a monster that 
moves. And however one looks at the design _ styling mishmash or inspired 
insanity? _ it may appeal to those self-assured enough to chart their 
own fashion course. Even someone initially cool to the look _ evocative 
of George Barris' California custom cars or perhaps a pizza delivery 
wagon from Toon Town _ may find himself admiring it after a few turns 
at the wheel. The body is low and reptilian, with serious 17-inch 
tires on 9-inch-wide rims set into bulging haunches. Viewed from the 
rear, slightly to the side, the pieces seem to fit and the lines have 
tension; from the front, the roofline seems to belong on a different 
car. BMW calls this a Gran Turismo coupe, an appellation once reserved 
for closed-body versions of open-top sports cars, long before ``GT'' 
labels appeared on Ford Escorts and Hyundai Accents. Even in BMW's 
stable, the M Coupe is the ultimate pony. It ostensibly weighs 47 
pounds more than its sister, and its body is 2.6 times stiffer, so 
there is none of the M Roadster's rough-road shake. In addition to 
being the most rigid BMW yet, the weight is balanced perfectly, 50-50, 
over the front and rear wheels (the roadster's ratio is 51-49). The 
suspension setups are similar, but the coupe's wheelbase is half an 
inch longer, the springs are stiffer and the rear anti-roll bar is 
larger. All these changes, especially the greater stiffness, make 
the M Coupe behave more predictably. Still, the M Coupe is lively 
enough that it sends amusement-ride shivers _ hints of danger, never 
realized _ up the spine. The car squats on hard acceleration, and 
it is a delight to hurl around. The steering is precise and instantaneous. 
With the traction control on, the rear end stayed planted while the 
front tangoed through twists and turns. And turning the traction off 
increased the thrills, allowing the wheels to spin and rubber to burn 
while racing through the five crisp gears. The smooth M engine has 
thrust in reserve at almost any engine speed (peak torque is 236 foot-pounds 
at 3,800 rpm). From a stop, the M Coupe reaches 60 mph in a shade 
over five seconds, a bit slower than a Corvette. A computer chip limits 
the top speed to 137 miles an hour. The coupe has its practical side. 
The hatch swallows enough gear for a weekend getaway, a retractable 
screen hides items from prying eyes, and a mesh net stretched behind 
the seats keeps cargo from bashing the occupants when one tests the 
M Coupe's very forceful brakes. But don't ruin a tire: there is no 
spare, just free roadside service. The cabin is cozy, more cocooning 
than the roadster's and a bit more spacious. But the steering wheel 
can't be adjusted, and you should finish your root beer before leaving 
the A&AMP;W _ no cup holders. There are just two factory options, 
a CD player ($200) integrated into the Harman Kardon stereo and a 
tilting glass panel for the roof ($300). Fog lights and an automatic 
transmission are not available. Those Sunday drivers can have their 
coupe and some frosting, too, with the Z3 Coupe 2.8. For $36,770 (the 
same price as the familiar Z3 2.8 in roadster form) BMW is offering 
the M Coupe's body with an updated 2.8-liter engine. The cheaper car 
benefits from the stiffer fixed-roof body, but it lacks the sport 
suspension that makes the M Coupe a beast, if not a beauty. The 2.8 
can also be had with an automatic, a trip computer and the like. BMW 
expects to sell 800 M Coupes and 650 Z3 Coupes for 1999. Although 
I was initially skeptical about the need for a closed-top Z3, and 
especially about the far-out design, the M Coupe won me over. It is 
the most pleasing two-seat Bimmer, a rebel yell from a company often 
noted for its conservatism. BMW says the M Coupe is ``eigenwillig,'' 
German for ``self-willed.'' After all, if you build a monster, why 
keep it on a leash? INSIDE TRACK: A Frankenstein on Astaire feet.
