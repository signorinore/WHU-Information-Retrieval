In a case that galvanized a bitter debate about police brutality in 
New York City, a federal judge in Manhattan sentenced a former police 
officer, Francis Livoti, to seven-and-a-half years in prison Thursday 
for violating the federal civil rights of Anthony Baez, who died after 
a 1994 confrontation with police officers outside his family's home 
in the Bronx. Saying that Livoti had caused the death of an innocent 
man, lied to cover it up and sought the testimony of other officers 
knowing that they would also lie, Judge Shira Scheindlin declared 
that no shorter term was adequate to punish the crime. ``Mr. Livoti, 
you killed a man,'' Scheindlin said. ``You disgraced the badge you 
wore. You will have to live with that. You decided that you were the 
law, and above the law. You were terribly wrong on both counts.'' 
The judge reached her sentence after prosecutors suggested that a 
term of at least 10 years would be appropriate and Livoti's lawyer 
proposed a sharply lower term, of between eight and 14 months. Scheindlin 
imposed the sentence before a packed courtroom of members of the Baez 
family and their supporters, and backers of Livoti, including his 
family and friends, and many police officers out of uniform. The officers 
sat silently and without noticeable expression as Scheindlin also 
issued a broad attack on the department's handling of Livoti's case, 
and said that she had refrained from imposing an even greater sentence 
because the department shared some responsibility in Baez's death. 
``The Police Department did Mr. Livoti and the people of this city 
a grave injustice when it permitted Mr. Livoti to remain on active 
patrol knowing of his propensity toward violence,'' Scheindlin said. 
``There is no doubt in my mind that the department knew, or should 
have known, that Mr. Livoti was dangerous.'' She said that nine earlier 
police brutality complaints against Livoti should have been enough 
``to alert those in charge to the fact that Mr. Livoti should be off 
the streets, if not off the force.'' ``The Police Department let him 
remain on the streets, knowing that one day a real tragedy would occur,'' 
she said. The judge's sentence does not necessarily end the four-year 
legal battle that had been waged from One Police Plaza to state Supreme 
Court in the Bronx and ultimately in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, 
to affix some form of responsibility to Livoti for the death of Baez. 
Livoti's lawyer, Stuart London, said Thursday night that he intended 
to appeal both his client's conviction and the sentence. He said that 
Livoti ``really thinks that he was just performing his duties as a 
cop'' the night Baez was killed. Livoti was acquitted of state charges 
of criminally negligent homicide in 1996; last year, he was found 
by a police hearing officer to have used an illegal choke hold to 
subdue Baez, and he was dismissed from the force by Police Commissioner 
Howard Safir. Thursday night, Safir and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani defended 
the department's handling of Livoti's case, and Giuliani, in a statement 
released by a spokesman, Jack Deacy, attacked the judge. ``Judge Scheindlin's 
comments regarding the Police Department during sentencing today are 
gratuitous,'' the mayor said, ``and certainly don't reflect the department's 
excellent record in uncovering corruption, and disciplining and dismissing 
rogue cops.'' The mayor added, ``Francis Livoti is a brutal criminal 
who deserves a long sentence in federal prison.''
