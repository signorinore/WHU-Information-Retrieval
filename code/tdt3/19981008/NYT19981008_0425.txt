Midway through the business meeting, an executive gathered his courage 
and stood up. Facing his colleagues across a blue conference table, 
he spoke briefly about an idea, opened his briefcase and began distributing 
a report that laid it all out. But his colleagues quickly saw that 
the executive had simply dusted off a pet project that senior management 
had rejected long ago. So as he gave out the reports, the men passed 
them to their left and around the table until the last man just replaced 
them all in the executive's briefcase. Then they started shouting 
at him. As the executive crawled under the table in embarrassment, 
the men jumped out of their seats and began skipping around the table. 
Was that ``Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho, It's Off to Work We Go'' they were 
humming? As a business meeting, it seemed horribly familiar, but as 
a modern dance performance, it was truly something different. The 
12-minute piece, ``The Meeting,'' will make its debut on Saturday 
at a benefit for the Peter Pucci Plus Dancers, a nonprofit Manhattan 
group. The performance will be at the Greenwich Academy's Wallace 
Performing Arts Center in Greenwich, Conn. ``The Meeting,'' created 
and choreographed by Peter Pucci, is a satirical look at business 
meetings, portraying their regimentation and politics, even accompanied 
at one point by the sound of bleating goats. ``There is so much huffing 
and puffing in business meetings,'' Pucci said. ``There was a lot 
of material there.'' No kidding. Meetings are the Rodney Dangerfield 
of the business world: While many good ideas come from them, meetings 
get no respect. They are often dreaded, even side-stepped. Some companies 
are installing conference tables with no chairs so that no one gets 
comfortable during meetings. In and out, the thought is. After all, 
did Gutenberg ever attend a meeting? But Pucci is not just taking 
an easy shot at a large target. He has asked the very targets to perform 
the piece. The five performers are businessmen from Greenwich, the 
town that probably has more chief executives per square foot than 
Wall Street. And four of the five performers, all over 50, had no 
dance experience until Pucci got them skipping around that table. 
``He's got it: the pulse of a business meeting,'' Malcolm Decker, 
71, an advertising executive who performs in the piece, said of Pucci. 
``He really gets to the core of the thing. The savagery, the competitiveness, 
which is, of course, masked in a gentlemanly way.'' Pucci, 44, has 
been dancing since he was 19 and has been choreographing since 1980. 
He has danced in the Joffrey Ballet and with the Pilobolus Dance Theater. 
He has composed works for the Joffrey and for a Sam Shepard play. 
But people with two left feet are nothing new to him: He once taught 
a man in a seven-foot bear costume to dance for a television show 
and had the entire cast of ``The Merry Wives of Windsor'' dancing 
the mambo at a theater in Washington. ``One may find that there will 
be more left feet than could be expected,'' Decker said of his performance 
in ``The Meeting.'' ``But we rehearsed and rehearsed, and I now know 
that I do have a right foot.'' Actually, Decker cheated. For the first 
few rehearsals, he tagged his right pants leg with a safety pin. He 
said it helped. Bill Thompson, 56, the only professional dancer in 
``The Meeting,'' said: ``To take people with no training and do this 
is brilliant. It ended up being a very nice piece.'' All the men are 
physically fit. They regularly taking exercise classes at Thompson's 
studio and are active skiers, golfers or tennis players. Pucci said 
he chose only men because he figured that, as neophyte dancers, they 
would feel more comfortable learning their moves, and making mistakes, 
in a men-only environment. Decker, the advertising executive, recalled 
a meeting years ago when he worked for the Walt Disney Co. At the 
meeting, he said, a Disney executive began yelling at ABC network 
officials. ``You're third rate in everything you do because you're 
third-rate people,' '' Decker remembered him saying. ``He said that 
with force and conviction,'' Decker added. ``I kind of fell off my 
seat. I've never heard that before. The ABC people demurred, of course.'' 
``The Meeting'' is just as contentious, and Decker gets to fall off 
his seat again. The piece begins with the five men going to work, 
walking across the stage with their briefcases. They move to a score 
recorded by Pucci that is a cacophony of voices, street noises and 
train sounds. The men meet at the conference table, where, after precision 
drill movements with their briefcases, they sit down to start the 
meeting. The first order of business is to cluck like chickens. After 
that, the meeting becomes rowdy as the men try to get the attention 
of the chief executive, played by Dr. John Tamerin, 61, as if he were 
Donald J. Trump. After Earle Cote, 69, is forced under the table, 
Thompson presents his report by tap-dancing on the table.. The piece 
ends after the chief executive takes control and forces everyone to 
read his report. While in real life, fawning executives would probably 
praise their boss, the men on stage throw the report into the air 
like confetti and fall on the floor asleep. Wishful thinking, perhaps. 
Tamerin, a Greenwich psychiatrist, said the show was unlike any meetings 
he had ever attended because he has attended so few. ``My whole life 
is dedicated to avoiding meetings,'' he said with a chuckle. ``I treat 
people who have meetings like this.''
