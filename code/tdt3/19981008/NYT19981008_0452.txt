Monsoon floods that lasted three times longer than any other in Bangladesh's 
history have finally receded and millions of people have begun cleaning 
the muck from their homes. But the country is still struggling to 
cope with the aftermath: hunger, disease and homelessness. A full 
picture of the devastation is beginning to emerge as researchers and 
government workers fan out into severely affected areas that were 
largely cut off. The floods lasted more than two months and inundated 
two-thirds of the impoverished country, where 120 million people live. 
The government estimates that 10,000 miles of roads, 14,000 schools 
and a million homes were heavily damaged. More than 2 million tons 
of rice that would have been harvested this year were either wiped 
out or never planted, a fearsome loss in a country where two-thirds 
of the children are seriously malnourished. As the mighty Padma, Jamuna 
amd Brahmaputra rivers have fallen below the danger level in the past 
two weeks, leaving behind a filthy sludge that nourishes disease, 
the number of people afflicted by diarrhea has soared to more than 
1 million, officials say. The official death toll now stands at 918 
_ mostly from diarrhea, cobra bites and drowning _ but epidemiologists 
say that number may rise to several thousand as reports come in from 
outlying areas. Government officials and relief workers say adequate 
food and medical supplies are arriving in Bangladesh through the port 
at Chittagong. The challenge is to speed distribution to the rural 
areas, where most people live. Bangladesh's prime minister, Sheik 
Hasina Wazed, met Tuesday with her Cabinet ministers and instructed 
them to hasten the distribution of food-ration cards to 4 million 
households, many of whom lost their ability to make a living when 
the floods swamped their crops, drowned their cattle and destroyed 
their seed stocks. She also ordered that a food-for-work program to 
rebuild damaged roads begin by Saturday and that a much larger reconstruction 
program get under way immediately, putting money in people's pockets 
and food on their tables. She has asked for $880 million in foreign 
aid and has received pledges of about $129 million, the government 
says. Representatives of international relief agencies praise Sheik 
Hasina's administration for removing bureaucratic obstacles, but they 
also worry that it is taking too long for the rice and wheat to pass 
through four levels of government to the smallest administrative unit. 
``The machinery at our disposal is a good one,'' said Werner Kiene, 
representative of the United Nations World Food Program in Dhaka, 
the capital. ``But we need to give it more speed, and the food needs 
to be pushed through this machinery.'' Similarly, the difficulty of 
treating people with diarrhea is not a shortage of the inexpensive 
life-saving solution of water, electrolytes and sugar that replenishes 
depleted bodily fluids, but delivery to sufferers. In many areas that 
are still partly flooded, the waters are now too shallow for boats 
to cross but the roads are still too muddy for wheeled vehicles to 
pass, said A.K. Siddique, an epidemiologist with the International 
Center for Diarrheal Disease Research in Dhaka. ``We are entering 
the most vulnerable period, when inaccessibility is the main constraint,'' 
he said.
