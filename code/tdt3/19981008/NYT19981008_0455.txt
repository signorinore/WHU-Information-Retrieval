Clear Channel Communications agreed Thursday to pay $2.8 billion in 
stock for Jacor Communications, the broadcaster that brings Rush Limbaugh, 
Dr. Laura Schlessinger and other radio personalities to the nation. 
The combined company would rank third in radio revenues, behind CBS 
and the Chancellor Broadcasting Co., and second in number of stations. 
Jacor's chairman is Sam Zell, a personality in his own right whose 
Zell/Chilmark Fund holds 26 percent of the company's shares. Analysts 
and others on Wall Street said that he had chosen Clear Channel in 
part because its founder and chief executive, L. Lowry Mays, had agreed 
to keep Jacor management and because he had confidence in Clear Channel 
and its stock. ``When someone as savvy as Zell looks at someone as 
savvy as Lowry Mays, I think he takes a lot of comfort from that,'' 
said Thomas Vanderslice, a managing director in investment banking 
for the CIBC Oppenheimer Corp. Mays said in an interview that the 
deal, which also included the assumption of $1.5 billion in Jacor's 
debt, would pay off through growth rather than cutbacks and economies. 
Having clusters of radio stations in many markets where he also has 
billboards, and programs to send everywhere, will help in attracting 
advertisers, he said. Jacor has about 40 percent of its radio station 
revenues in cities where Clear Channel has forests of billboards. 
But the Clear Channel radio stations are mostly in different markets, 
Mays said, making it easy to win government approval for the deal 
without having to sell many stations off. The combined company would 
have two or more radio stations in six of the nation's 12 largest 
markets, but not New York City. There, Clear Channel, the nation's 
largest billboard company, has more than 1,000 billboards. In a rapidly 
consolidating business, analysts praised the Jacor acquisition as 
complementary and fairly priced. ``It's a very good fit,'' said Jessica 
Reif Cohen, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, confirming the company's 
prediction that 1999's earnings per share would benefit. Analysts 
also agreed, however, that Jacor would have fetched more before stock 
market reversals that had hit media companies especially hard. In 
another rough day for the markets, Clear Channel shares fell 37.5 
cents, to $36.625, while Jacor rose 43.75 cents, to $40.5625. Standard 
&AMP; Poor's said it was considering downgrading Clear Chanel's debt 
and upgrading Jacor's. Since Congress eased the limits on radio station 
ownership, buyers have built large companies able to offer advertisers 
the sort of broad coverage, within a market or across the nation, 
that newspapers and television have boasted. Analysts said that CBS 
was the most serious rival Jacor bidder, with Chancellor, controlled 
by the Hicks, Muse leveraged buyout firm, also having shown an interest. 
Clear Channel, based in San Antonio, has 625 radio stations, 19 television 
stations and about 220,000 billboards in 25 countries. Mays founded 
the company with Red McCombs, a flamboyant San Antonio car dealer 
who now owns the Minnesota Vikings, 26 years ago when they bought 
a local FM station for $130,000. Mays is about as modest in discussing 
his company's performance since then as Limbaugh is in discussing 
the virtues of his political doctrines. ``A stellar growth performance 
history,'' Mays said. Based in Covington, Ky., Jacor, including pending 
acquisitions, has 230 radio stations and one television station, as 
well as Premiere Radio Networks, which syndicates radio shows. Zell, 
said to be out of the country, could not be reached for comment.
