Working against deadlines imposed by New York's financial markets, 
city and state officials are scrambling to complete a series of complex 
deals that would create new headquarters for the New York, American 
and Nasdaq Stock Exchanges in lower Manhattan. Taken together, the 
deals could cost the city and state more than $700 million, mainly 
in cash. The search for new homes for the financial industry has become 
a high-stakes, real estate version of musical chairs, as the exchanges 
_ which are also being wooed by New Jersey _ try to extract subsidy 
packages and New York developers maneuver to get a piece of the business. 
Officials are optimistic that they can cobble together an agreement 
to buy five parcels, diagonally across Broad Street from the New York 
Stock Exchange, where a new trading floor and a billion-dollar headquarters 
would be built. The outline of a deal would need to be in place by 
the Nov. 4 board meeting of the exchange, which has said it would 
consider a move to Battery Park City or New Jersey if the city is 
unable to secure a location in the financial district. At the same 
time, city and state officials are trying to forge an agreement this 
week with the National Association of Securities Dealers, which owns 
Nasdaq and is acquiring the American Stock Exchange, for a new headquarters 
for those exchanges on an empty lot in Tribeca, in Battery Park City 
or at 42nd Street and the Avenue of the Americas, near Times Square. 
The NASD, which met Thursday in New York, is also considering two 
waterfront projects in Jersey City. ``It's been a game of musical 
chairs,'' said Mary Ann Tighe, executive managing director of the 
Insignia/Edward S. Gordon real estate company, ``but now it looks 
like everybody is going to find a place to sit down.'' The exchanges 
are bargaining for a lot more than cuts in taxes. The markets, particularly 
the New York Stock Exchange, are also pushing the state and the city 
to provide cash to offset the cost of constructing a modern trading 
operation. To clinch the deals, the city and state may have to provide 
$700 million in cash, tax breaks and low-cost electricity, an immense 
sum but less than half the estimated cost to taxpayers of the proposed 
baseball stadiums for the Yankees and the Mets, taken together. Officials 
say the city cannot afford to lose the New York Stock Exchange, and 
that a deal with Nasdaq and the American Exchange would be a coup 
for New York: moving the NASD headquarters and several hundred employees 
from Washington to Manhattan. Fearing the flight of the financial 
industry in New York, during the last 15 years officials have granted 
nearly a billion dollars in tax breaks and other incentives to investment 
banks and other institutions. The financial industry accounts for 
only 5 percent of the jobs in New York, but tax revenues linked to 
the industry generated most of the city's $2.1 billion budget surplus 
last year.
