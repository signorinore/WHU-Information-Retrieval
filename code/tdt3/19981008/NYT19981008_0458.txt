Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday that she would review accusations 
by President Clinton's lawyer that Kenneth Starr might have misled 
the Justice Department in January when he sought permission to begin 
an investigation into Clinton's relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky. 
The Clinton lawyer, David Kendall, wrote to Reno on Monday to say 
that news accounts and information released by the House Judiciary 
Committee suggested that Linda Tripp had manipulated events to allow 
Starr, the independent counsel, to assume legal jurisdiction over 
the case and that Mrs. Tripp in turn might have been prompted by Starr's 
office. When the Justice Department allowed Starr last winter to investigate 
the Lewinsky matter, it did so primarily on the basis of evidence 
indicating that a job offer Ms. Lewinsky had received might have been 
in exchange for her silence, as a witness in the Paula Jones civil 
case, about her relationship with Clinton. The job offer, from Revlon, 
had been extended through the help of Clinton's close friend Vernon 
Jordan. In his letter to Reno, Kendall wrote, ``Recently released 
material by the House Judiciary Committee demonstrates that it was 
almost certainly Ms. Tripp who first encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to seek 
Jordan's assistance, and that it was Ms. Tripp and only Ms. Tripp 
who suggested a job-for-affidavit quid pro quo (which Ms. Lewinsky 
testified she declined to seek).'' ``Now,'' Kendall wrote, ``major 
news organizations have suggested that Ms. Tripp's encouragement of 
these acts may have resulted from prompting by Office of Independent 
Counsel staff.'' The letter noted that although Starr had told Congress 
that he had learned of the Clinton-Lewinsky affair from Mrs. Tripp 
herself, recent news reports said his office had received word of 
it from a lawyer sympathetic to Paula Jones at least a week earlier. 
Kendall asked Reno to disclose all the materials that Starr presented 
to her and her aides in January. In response, Starr's office said 
in a statement that his prosecutors had been ``professional, responsible 
and forthright'' in their dealings with the Justice Department. The 
statement said Kendall's letter was ``notable for its lengthy attacks 
on the conduct of persons outside the Office of Independent Counsel 
and the absence of any connection between those actions and those 
of members of this office, other than innuendo and guilt by association.'' 
Reno said at her weekly news conference Thursday that she was looking 
into the matter. ``We are reviewing Kendall's letter to see what would 
be appropriate action, if any, to take,'' she said. ``With respect 
to what I can comment on, I can tell you that I'm conducting a review. 
I can't comment on the nature of the review.'' Reno said that in considering 
the matter, the Justice Department would look at the thousands of 
pages of documents from the independent counsel that have recently 
been released by the House Judiciary Committee. Justice Department 
officials said Reno's review did not constitute a formal inquiry.
