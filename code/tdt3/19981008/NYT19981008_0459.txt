Remember the golden age of radio and the early days of television, 
when dulcet-voiced announcers like Don Wilson, Harry Von Zell and 
Ed Herlihy let listeners and viewers know that programs were being 
``brought to you by'' sponsors like Lucky Strike cigarettes, Carnation 
milk and Kraft cheese? If only those smooth-talking pitchmen could 
be on hand for the 89th annual conference of the Association of National 
Advertisers, to let attendees know that programs will be brought to 
them by sponsors like ESPN, Time Inc. and USA Today. Media companies 
are paying an estimated $100,000 to sponsor each of the three daily 
general sessions of the conference, which began Thursday afternoon 
at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Naples, Fla. For that fee, the sponsors 
are paying their way onto the conference programs by staging presentations 
at the general sessions starting Friday morning; they also receive 
flattering write-ups in the conference newsletters. This is the second 
time the association has sold participation in the conference that 
goes well beyond such typical support as media companies' paying for 
receptions and meals. It marks a reversal of the traditional pattern 
of marketers' having to pay the media for commercial time and advertising 
space. Last year, when the association first expanded media sponsorship 
availabilities, some attendees grumbled that the general sessions 
_ paid for by ABC, CBS and Fox _ amounted to little more than the 
conference equivalent of TV infomercials or print advertorials. For 
instance, in an interview with the trade publication Advertising Age, 
Cathleen P. Black, president of the magazine division of the Hearst 
Corp. in New York, said, ``If you look at the program, no one would 
imagine that print exists.'' So of course eyebrows rose when Ms. Black 
agreed to sponsor a general session at the 1998 conference. ``If you 
can't fight 'em, join 'em,'' Ms. Black said in an interview this week 
before the conference began. ``A national convention should probably 
not be bought out by sponsors,'' she added, ``and ideally ought to 
be a neutral forum for thinking about where the business is going.'' 
Ms. Black said that she ``would not be in support'' of her trade association, 
the Magazine Publishers of America, selling sponsored sessions at 
its conferences. ``But the ANA has taken a particular direction, and 
John feels very committed to it,'' she added. ``So I'm delighted to 
have an opportunity to talk about the importance and effectiveness 
of print.'' Her reference was to John J. Sarsen Jr., president and 
chief executive of the association, which is based in New York. He 
has staunchly defended the idea of sponsored sessions and was instrumental 
in bringing them back for 1998. ``We've had nothing but positive responses 
to the format we established last year,'' Sarsen said, ``and the attendance 
this time looks like another all-time record high'' at about 550 registrants. 
``These conferences are very difficult and expensive to put together,'' 
he added. ``The sponsorship fees enable us to produce a meeting of 
the proper caliber.'' ``Everything we're talking about'' at the conference 
``is totally consistent with a marketer trying to build business by 
building brands,'' Sarsen said, ``and reaching the changing consumer.'' 
His reference was to the theme of the conference, which is ``Brand 
Champions: Connecting With the New Consumer.'' However, compared with 
1997, when all sponsors were broadcast television networks, ``we tried 
to be more inclusive'' this year, Sarsen said, ``with an array of 
sponsors.'' Ms. Black arranged for Hearst to share its sponsorship 
with other magazine publishers, she said, so attendees would hear 
``a subtle pitch'' rather than a hard sell. The Hearst general session 
Saturday morning will include representatives from the Reader's Digest 
Association and the Time Inc. unit of Time Warner Inc. ``This is an 
opportunity to get in front of a very prestigious group of our very 
best customers and present to them,'' said David Long, president for 
media sales and marketing at Time Inc. in New York. ``The paying aspect 
is somewhat irrelevant.'' The other sponsors are USA Today, published 
by the Gannett Co., and ESPN, the cable sports television network 
owned by the Walt Disney Co. ``We're obviously as cost conscious as 
anybody,'' said George Bodenheimer, executive vice president for sales 
and marketing at ESPN in New York, ``so you have to look at something 
like this on a case-by-base basis.'' ``But we've got a terrific brand 
story to tell,'' he added, ``focusing on how we created our brand, 
developed a distinct brand image and extended it to the Internet, 
radio and a magazine. That's very in keeping with the theme of the 
conference.'' Editors of Advertising Age, who in editorials and columns 
have been the most outspoken critics of the sponsorship idea, continue 
to decry the concept. ``It's basically selling out,'' said Scott Donaton, 
the New York-based editor of Advertising Age, a Crain Communications 
publication. ``If you think the media have a branding story to tell,'' 
he added, ``have them on a panel.'' That opinion was echoed by the 
head of the counterpart of the advertiser association. ``I have no 
problems with the media sponsoring our cocktail receptions and events 
like that,'' said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of 
the American Association of Advertising Agencies in New York. ``But 
in our view, the programming should be the programming.'' The general 
sessions of the conference, which ends on Sunday night, will also 
feature speakers from companies that are not buying sponsorships. 
Among them are Denis F. Beausejour, vice president for advertising 
at the Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.; Robert A. Eckert, president and chief 
executive at the Kraft Foods unit of the Philip Morris Companies; 
Robert W. Pittman, president and chief operating officer at America 
Online Inc., and Raymond W. Smith, chairman of the Bell Atlantic Corp.
