All but one of 36 lymph nodes taken from Darryl Strawberry were free 
of cancer, his doctors at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in 
Manhattan reported Thursday, and they said the Yankee outfielder could 
be released from the hospital on Sunday. In a statement released through 
the hospital, doctors presented an optimistic report on his condition 
and predicted he would ``make a complete recovery and return to full 
activities including playing major league baseball next season.'' 
Colon cancer was diagnosed for Strawberry, 36, on Oct. 1, and he had 
surgery two days later to remove a tumor and a 16-inch portion of 
his large intestine. According to the statement, one lymph node contained 
evidence of tumor. The margins of the colon, doctors said, were free 
of disease. They said Strawberry would require a ``course of adjuvant 
chemotherapy,'' meaning he would be administered drugs to help prevent 
a recurrence of the cancer. There was no mention whether he would 
need radiation treatment. In a statement released through the team, 
Strawberry said: ``I am really feeling stronger every day, and I'm 
truly grateful to all of my doctors. They feel very good about everything 
and are confident this will be a successful process. When you are 
in a situation like this, you put yourself in your doctors' hands. 
I share their confidence.'' David Cone, the Yankees' pitcher and a 
longtime teammate of Strawberry with the Mets and Yankees, said: ``It 
looks good. We all anticipated some chemo _ to what extent, we didn't 
know. It seems like good news right now.''
