It is some distance from the leftist revolutionary struggles of Frankfurt 
in the 1970s to the corridors of power in Washington, but Joschka 
Fischer of Germany completes that long march on Friday, with unpredictable 
consequences for the Atlantic alliance and for Kosovo. Fischer, a 
leader of the environmentalist Green Party, is to hold talks with 
President Clinton as part of a German delegation led by Chancellor-elect 
Gerhard Schroeder. His presence suggests that he will emerge as foreign 
minister in the coalition government of Social Democrats and Greens 
now being formed. Self-educated, irreverent, a former worker in an 
Opel auto plant and once a member of the Revolutionary Struggle movement 
in Germany, Fischer personifies the emergence of a post-Cold War generation 
of German politicians. The question is: Will the German-U.S. bonds 
that the Cold War forged prove impervious to this change? Nobody, 
of course, would have come this far without a fair dose of intelligent 
pragmatism, and Fischer, 50, has already said continuity will be central 
to German foreign policy under any ``Red-Green'' coalition. His enduring 
contempt for neckties is balanced by a growing respect for NATO. ``No 
adventures'' has become a maxim. But even for a man who has moved 
from a long-held pacifism to the belief that force has its place in 
diplomacy _ a conversion painfully completed by the Bosnian war _ 
Clinton's support for military action against Yugoslav forces in Kosovo 
Province poses an acute and unwanted quandary. Fischer is unconvinced 
that NATO has a mandate to act in Kosovo, officials close to him said. 
Even if this hesitation _ largely shared by Schroeder _ is overcome 
under Clinton's suasion, it underscores the new challenges facing 
America with a Germany more ready to think independently about its 
world role. ``Fischer believes strongly in Germany's anchoring in 
the alliance, but also in reinforcing the role of the United Nations,'' 
said Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a leader of the 1968 student movement in 
Paris and longtime friend of Fischer's. ``He is very unhappy about 
the idea of using force in Kosovo without a specific Security Council 
mandate.'' Fischer declined to be interviewed. But Cohn-Bendit, a 
Green member of the European Parliament who has spoken regularly to 
the Green leaders in recent days, said the party saw a danger that 
a NATO air strike in Kosovo opposed by Russia and unbacked by an explicit 
Security Council resolution would provoke a treacherous ``regionalization'' 
of world affairs. ``It would say to the Russians and Chinese, we do 
what we want on our side, and you do what you want on your sides,'' 
he said. The United States, however, takes the view that a U.N. resolution 
passed last month calling on Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, 
to withdraw special police and army units from Kosovo is sufficient 
legal basis for the use of force. ``I do not see any need for additional 
resolutions,'' U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Thursday. 
That message, officials said, will be conveyed to Schroeder and Fischer 
in Washington on Friday. The story of Fischer's life _ as well as 
the Greens' thirst to taste power for the first time two decades after 
their founding _ suggests that he will be amenable to compromise. 
``Sometimes I have balanced on the edge of an abyss, but I was always 
able to see the reality that the abyss was there,'' Fischer once said. 
``And I always managed to step back in time.'' The son of a butcher, 
Fischer did not complete high school and married for the first time 
while still in his teens; he has been married three times, one less 
than Schroeder. By the early 1970s, he was living in a commune in 
Frankfurt, reading German philosophers voraciously and working with 
other members of Revolutionary Struggle toward a vision of a libertarian 
and egalitarian society Violence was not part of the movement's arsenal. 
But on one occasion, after the revolutionary leftist leader Ulrike 
Meinhof committed suicide in prison in 1976, street protests in Frankfurt 
became uncontrollable, and a policeman was severely burned. Fischer 
and 13 other members of his movement were arrested and held for 36 
hours. In the view of the author Christian Schmidt, who has written 
a book about Fischer, that experience marked a turning point. Fischer 
had been incensed by Ms. Meinhof's death, describing it as ``an annihilation 
in the truest sense of the word,'' but he now turned away from extremism. 
Within weeks of the incident, he spoke of how the best ideals and 
intentions could be ``turned upside down into crime'' if they proved 
unattainable, and urged a course of moderation and nonviolence. ``That 
was the start of the long march away from militancy,'' Schmidt said. 
``He now represents a whole general generation of Germans who were 
students with revolutionary thoughts and have become dentists and 
lawyers. At root, he is a highly gifted opportunist who has come to 
believe in the virtues of reliability.'' Fischer joined the Greens 
in 1982, convinced that they were the only political force capable 
of bringing real change to Germany. The experience of power _ he was 
environment minister in the state of Hesse _ completed his conversion 
to the merits of compromise. In recent years, he has persistently 
stood against the so-called ``fundamentalist'' wing of the party that 
is still committed to its pacifist roots. But even the many U.S. officials 
who are convinced that Fischer will, in the end, prove supportive 
on Kosovo and other issues worry about the party behind him. ``Can 
he deliver the Greens?'' an official said. ``That is what we need 
to know.'' The party is to meet on Oct. 23 to approve any coalition 
agreement, and some party members have already warned that an attack 
on Kosovo without an explicit U.N. mandate would be a serious obstacle 
to their support.
