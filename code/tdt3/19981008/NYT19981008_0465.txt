The Bank of England cut its benchmark interest rate by one-quarter 
of a percentage point Thursday, reflecting concern about global financial 
turmoil and fears of recession among British exporters and manufacturers. 
It was the bank's first such action since June 1996. The general response 
to the reduction, to 7.25 percent from 7.5 percent, however, was that 
it would make little immediate difference to Britain's economic slowdown. 
``What makes a difference is the signal that rates are coming down,'' 
said Holger Schmieding, an economist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``It 
was important in that those expectations were not disappointed.'' 
The reduction had little effect on currency trading and did nothing 
to halt the slide of British equity markets. London's Financial Times 
100 index slumped 2.7 percent Thursday, to 4,698.90 points. The British 
rate cut matched a similar quarter-point reduction by the Federal 
Reserve in the United States last week and coincided with indications 
that interest rates internationally are falling. Japan, Canada and 
Spain have also cut rates; Portugal and Ireland are expected to drop 
their higher rates to the average among the nine other nations preparing 
to introduce the single European currency on Jan. 1. The Bank of England's 
nine-member Monetary Policy Committee _ which is responsible for setting 
interest rates _ said it had taken the action because the worsening 
international climate had damaged business and consumer confidence. 
The bank's guidelines are primarily to hold down inflation to a target 
of 2.5 percent. Despite indications this week that British paychecks 
are soaring, the bank said Thursday that inflation might fall to less 
than 2.5 percent, making it ``appropriate'' to cut interest rates. 
The modest reduction disappointed some analysts who had been hoping 
for a reduction of half a percentage point. ``It's obviously a move 
in the right direction, and it's obviously part of what's necessary,'' 
said David Mackie, an economist at J.P. Morgan. ``But the Bank of 
England has a lot more to do. The economy is going to be very weak 
next year, and they'll need to react to that by cutting rates aggressively.'' 
Thursday's rate cut came after projections by Gordon Brown, the Chancellor 
of the Exchequer, that growth would be far slower next year than the 
government had first forecast _ possibly as low as 1 percent.
