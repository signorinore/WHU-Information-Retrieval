There is a mellow streak in the Cleveland Indians. The Indians are 
so laid back and patient they will wait for anything: paint to dry, 
a pot to boil or a crack to develop in a landmark. A fissure developed 
in the mighty Yankees and flaws were exposed on Wednesday night during 
Game 2 of the American League Championship Series. No matter how unsinkable 
the Yankees looked in Game 1, the Indians remained unfazed and were 
confident that an iceberg lurked around the corner. Chuck Knoblauch 
proved that. A ball sat on the dirt behind first base in the 12th 
inning while Knoblauch argued with the umpire, and Enrique Wilson 
kept running. Wilson scored the deciding run in the Indians' 4-1 victory. 
At the end, the controversy became the focus of the Yankees' loss. 
In fact, the sage Indians outsmarted and outplayed them. ``We did 
the little things,'' shortstop Omar Vizquel said Thursday as the Indians 
prepared for Friday night's Game 3 with a workout at Jacobs Field. 
``It's hard to do the little things when you have smart people like 
they have doing it the other way around. ``What were they thinking? 
They had Tim Raines bunting, and he couldn't bunt. They had Shane 
Spencer hitting with nobody out and he couldn't do his job. A stupid 
bunt meant three runs for us.'' Travis Fryman put down the fundamental 
bunt that started the bizarre ending and began the lambasting of Knoblauch. 
A day later, the Indians were only happy to revel in the misery of 
the Yankees. ``The way they were getting on Knoblauch, that can create 
dissension within their team,'' reliever Paul Shuey said. ``It can't 
be good for that team. But it's good for us. We'll take what we can 
get.'' Patience is the Indians' virtue. That's why their collapse 
in Game 1 at the feet of the Yankees, allowing five first-inning runs 
in a 7-2 loss, rolled right off their backs. Far be it from the Indians 
to panic. In their last eight playoff series _ dating to 1995 _ they 
have lost every Game 1. Four times they have come back to win the 
series. They have a fifth opportunity in front of them. ``We're a 
veteran team and we know each other,'' first baseman Jim Thome said. 
``We shrug off bad days and have confidence that we're good enough 
to come back.'' A team less self-assured _ and the Yankees have left 
many opponents searching for self-esteem this season _ might have 
been shaken by the dominance the Yankees displayed in Game 1. But 
the Indians have been around too long to be daunted. There is a core 
to this team, including Vizquel, Thome, Kenny Lofton, Sandy Alomar, 
Manny Ramirez and Charles Nagy, that remembers the resilience they 
showed in making it to the 1995 World Series. ``If you go to play, 
and you're afraid of a team, you're never going to beat them,'' Alomar 
said. ``You have to say, `You're here and you might as well show them 
you can play, too.' You can't fear anybody. If you lose a Game 1, 
it's out the window. Forget it. This is baseball. It's not predictable.'' 
Few would have predicted a series dead even after two games. A split 
in Yankee Stadium? It seemed improbable. At least in the afterglow 
of the Yankees' breakdown in Game 2, some of the Indians were chiding 
those who felt the men in the celebrated pinstripes were flawless. 
``Everyone wants the Yankees to win,'' Vizquel said. ``It doesn't 
matter whether it's ESPN, CNN or the FBI; everyone wants to see the 
Yankees win. ``We never thought the Yankees were unbeatable. We know 
we have guys who can do it under pressure, like the veterans you see 
around our clubhouse. We've been in situations before when it looked 
like we didn't have a chance. If the pitchers can keep us in the game 
_ like they did last night _ we always have a chance to win.'' Seven 
Indians pitchers, from Nagy to closer Mike Jackson, held the robust 
offense of the Yankees to just seven hits over 12 innings. One run, 
that's all they could muster. And yet, the Indians heard little, if 
any, credit offered to them for the victory. ``In the interview room 
yesterday, all they talked about was the call and the umpire,'' Vizquel 
said Thursday, referring to the Yankees' post-game comments. ``They 
did not talk about them anticipating the bunt by Fryman. They did 
not talk about driving in a run when they needed to. They did not 
say any of that. ``It's probably because they cannot take losing.'' 
The Indians can take it, but then they discard it like a paper wad. 
That is the nature of a mellow team that perseveres with uncommon 
patience. ``We do the little things,'' Vizquel said. ``We do the fundamentals. 
We were working on bunt plays after the playoffs started. We were 
like, `What on earth are we doing this for?' But just wait, and it 
pays off.''
