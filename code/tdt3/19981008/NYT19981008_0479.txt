In earlier eras in baseball, umpires felt they were doing a good job 
if no one noticed them or talked about them. In this year's playoffs, 
people everywhere have noticed the umpires and, oh, are they talking 
about them. Take Joe Brinkman, for example. Brinkman leaped out of 
anonymity in the second game of the division series between Cleveland 
and the Boston Red Sox, ejecting Indians' manager Mike Hargrove three 
pitches into the game, and then Dwight Gooden after he had faced only 
four batters and thrown 22 pitches. Gooden was irate over Brinkman's 
calls on some of those 22 pitches, and he disputed a Brinkman call 
at the plate that television replays showed was clearly wrong. This 
all happened only a couple of weeks after Marty Springstead, the American 
League's executive director of umpiring, wrote Brinkman a letter about 
his positioning behind the plate. It is a subject that the league 
has periodically discussed with Brinkman, who sets up farther from 
the catcher than other umpires. ``Obviously you can't see the plate 
from that far behind the catcher,'' a member of the Cleveland organization 
said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because umpires can strike 
back. ``I don't see how a call can be made up and down or in and out 
consistently that far back. It's totally unprofessional.'' If Brinkman 
caught people's attention with his calls in Cleveland on Sept. 30, 
Ted Hendry absolutely grabbed everyone by the lapels with his calls 
Wednesday in New York. A practitioner of the wide, wide strike zone 
that has been adopted by an increasing number of umpires, Hendry capped 
a controversial night of ball-strike calls by ruling that Travis Fryman 
did not interfere with Tino Martinez's throw to Chuck Knoblauch at 
first base in the 12th inning. ``He was calling some terrible pitches 
on both sides,'' said Cleveland shortstop Omar Vizquel. ``The whole 
thing was a joke.'' The fatter strike zone is a relatively recent 
development, only a few years in the making. Umpires long ago stopped 
using the rule-book strike zone, ignoring the part of the zone above 
the waist. But now some umpires call strikes on pitches that are several 
inches from either side of the plate. ``It's frustrating,'' Paul O'Neill 
of the Yankees said. ``I don't know if they're intentionally doing 
it to speed games up. But if the strike zone is here,'' he said, gesturing 
with his hand, ``they're going to throw it there. If it's here, they're 
going to throw it there. As wide as they go, the pitchers are going 
to continually throw wider and wider.'' O'Neill said batters would 
much rather see the high strike called than the wide strike. ``The 
high strike you can still hack at it, foul it off or something,'' 
he said. ``But that ball six inches off the plate sinking away and 
they force you to swing at it, you can't hit it.'' Some umpires call 
low strikes, some call high strikes, O'Neill added, ``but it seems 
like everybody likes the wide pitch now.'' Wide outside or inside, 
he was asked. ``Mostly outside,'' he said. ``If you give them both, 
you might as well go up there without a bat.'' Hargrove said players 
don't mind a different strike zone if umpires stick to it. ``It's 
our job to adjust to that strike zone,'' the manager said. ``Nobody 
has a problem with that. What's a problem is one time this is a ball 
and the next time it's a strike.'' John Hirschbeck, the umpire who 
will go down in history with Roberto Alomar, probably has the widest 
strike zone in the American League, Hargrove said. ``But he probably 
has less arguments because you know what his strike zone is going 
to be.'' No one knows for sure why the wider zone has emerged, but 
one American League manager offered a theory. ``I think the umpires 
hear people say that the reason games are too long is we need a bigger 
strike zone. I've heard an umpire say as recently as three weeks ago, 
`The more strikes I call, the less trouble I get into.' I think they 
listen to the criticism and they say: `Oh yeah? Watch this.' '' Compared 
with their predecessors, today's umpires are also generally more confrontational. 
Instead of walking away from a manager or a player who wants to argue, 
umpires often look for arguments, following a manager or a player 
back toward the dugout to continue the dispute. The same manager told 
of some umpires who make a ball or strike call, then look straight 
at him in the dugout ``waiting for me to say something.'' ``Umpires 
say, `Now don't you come out here,''' the manager related. ``I've 
got 25 players who have just heard him tell me I can't do something. 
I can't not go out.'' Yankee coach Don Zimmer recalled how umpires 
used to treat arguments. ''Years ago, if you had a beef, they'd listen 
to your beef if it was legitimate and you did it the right way. When 
they had enough, they'd say `Get away from me.' If you didn't get 
away, you were out. Today, with some of them, you say something from 
the dugout, off comes the mask and they cuss at you. If I cuss at 
them, I get fined. That just happened to me.'' Zimmer referred to 
the $300 fine he incurred from a brawl between the Yankees and the 
Toronto Blue Jays. The prevailing view among baseball people is that 
the umpires have turned more confrontational, in some cases vindictive, 
at the urging of their union leader, Richie Phillips, who has maintained 
a militant stance during his years in office. Phillips has had much 
to do with the method of selection of umpires for post-season games. 
In an earlier collective bargaining agreement, umpires were chosen 
strictly on a rotating basis. The leagues have long wanted a merit 
system, but the best they got was the compromise that exists in the 
current agreement. Under the system in use, all umpires are eligible 
for post-season series and the All-Star Game. However, an umpire cannot 
work more than one ``special event'' except he can work a division 
series and the World Series. Furthermore, no umpire can work two successive 
World Series. The American League staff has 32 umpires. Twenty-four 
are needed for the so-called special events. Selection was limited 
for this post-season, said league senior vice president Phyllis Merhige, 
because six umpires are hurt and unable to work. Yankees manager Joe 
Torre did not like Hendry's work Wednesday and said so publicly in 
uncharacteristically harsh and outspoken terms. ``I anticipate I'll 
get fined,'' he said Thursday. Hendry only got noticed.
