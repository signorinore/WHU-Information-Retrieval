The New York Yankees were hesitant to open the doors to the visiting 
clubhouse before their optional workout at Jacobs Field on Thursday 
afternoon. Just wait for some more players to arrive, they requested. 
It was a curious decision because Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankee virtually 
everyone wanted to interview, had already strolled in. Once the doors 
opened and minutes before Knoblauch finally blamed himself for not 
retrieving a very important and very loose baseball on a disputed 
play Wednesday night, a bunch of Yankees were methodically returning 
to work. There were 14 Yankees who worked out on the day after Knoblauch's 
brain cramp, 14 Yankees who did not want to sit in a hotel room, go 
see a movie or watch a sports highlight show and possibly see that 
devastating sequence again. The empty ball park was their refuge. 
``I think it's good for us to come back and keep doing what got us 
here,'' Tim Raines said. ``I don't think anyone is about to jump ship. 
We still think we've got the best team in the American League. We 
had opportunities to win that game and we didn't. No one in here thinks 
it's the end of the world.'' Paul O'Neill certainly looked relaxed 
in a T-shirt and sliding shorts, with his legs stretched between two 
folding chairs. O'Neill would have preferred to talk about Friday's 
Game 3 of the AL Championship Series against Cleveland, but the Yankees 
were forced to rehash the gory details of the 4-1 loss to the Indians. 
It was not as arduous for them as it obviously was for Knoblauch, 
New York's newest villain. Still, only a series victory will make 
the memories of this bizarre play fade. ``If there's a ball rolling 
around now, I'm sure nine guys will be running after it,'' O'Neill 
said. ``It's easy to say now. It's almost comical.'' But there was 
nothing comical about botching the chance to go ahead, 2-0, in the 
four-of-seven-game series. Now the Yankees, a mighty team that had 
some observers thinking sweep after burying the Indians, 7-2, in the 
opener, must hope that Andy Pettitte can pitch effectively for a second 
straight start and that their offense awakens against Bartolo Colon. 
This is a much stickier scenario for the Yankees since the series 
is tied and the next three games will be played in a park where the 
Indians have won 63 percent of their games in the last five years. 
``I don't think there was a huge momentum swing,'' Chili Davis said. 
``If I was in Cleveland's shoes, I would think there's somewhat of 
a momentum swing. Now they've got three games at home. If we play 
well, we'll beat them. If not, we're in trouble.'' The Yankees had 
initially announced Wednesday night that they would not hold a workout 
Thursday, but they changed plans after the AL reminded them that it 
is mandatory and that they would be fined if they did not have one. 
So manager Joe Torre called for the optional session. As it was, the 
Yankees were fined $25,000 for restricting the news media's access 
to the field before Game 1, and the Boston Red Sox were fined $25,000 
for not working out on an off day during the division series last 
week. The Yankees were at Jacobs Field on Thursday so there were no 
more fines. Just some one-liners from Torre, whose quips made it seem 
as if he had already forgotten Wednesday's ending. ``I told the guys 
to go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame today and then they all asked 
me for tickets and I couldn't get them,'' Torre said. ``Basically, 
a few guys wanted to hit so I allowed it to be just optional. So I 
really didn't change my mind.'' When Torre was asked if he wanted 
to bypass the workout so players could erase what had happened, he 
did not deny that he wanted to give them a mental holiday. ``That 
was the intention, but not because of the screwed-up game,'' Torre 
said. ``I think if we had lost the game in just the pedestrian way 
with a home run, I'd have felt the same way. It had nothing to do 
with trying to hide out from anybody.'' There will be nowhere for 
Pettitte to hide Friday night. He guided the Yankees to a 3-1 victory 
over Texas in Game 2 of the division series with eight dependable 
innings, cutting away some of the doubts about him after he slogged 
through August and September with a 3-5 record and a 6.14 ERA. Pettitte 
lost twice to the Indians in the 1997 division series, which will 
surely be on his mind. ``This time of the year, every win is sweet 
and every loss is tough,'' Pettitte said. ``This is for all the marbles 
and it's to go into the World Series, so much more intensity and so 
much more fire in the game and stuff. It's tough on you when you lose 
them and it's definitely a lot sweeter when you're winning them.'' 
What made Pettitte so dominant against the Rangers was a sneaky fastball 
and an ability to nick the corners with his off-speed pitches, and 
Pettitte said that he would pitch the Indians the same way. Colon, 
who struck out 10 in an 11-0 victory over the Yankees on June 21, 
also won the decisive Game 4 of the division series over Boston. For 
a few innings, Colon admitted he was ``scared'' against the Red Sox. 
``I didn't sense that,'' Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove said. ``And 
if he was scared in Boston, I hope he's scared to death tomorrow night 
because he threw the ball very, very well and was very focused.'' 
The focus shifts to Game 3 on Friday and the Yankees hope they do 
something special that makes the focus shift away from Knoblauch's 
gaffe. The glare remained on Knoblauch on Thursday, a day when most 
Yankees found it necessary to be at the park. They opened the clubhouse 
doors and went back to work, which is really all they could do. ``I 
don't think it deflated us,'' said Shane Spencer. ``It might have 
even woke us up.''
