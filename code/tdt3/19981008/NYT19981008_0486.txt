The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 9: If the 
New York Yankees needed any further incentive to beat the Cleveland 
Indians in the American League playoff series and move on to the World 
Series, Chuck Knoblauch has given it to them. Only a victory will 
allow forgiveness of Knoblauch's blunder that gave the Indians the 
winning run on Wednesday night. If the Yankees lose, Knoblauch will 
forever be remembered in the same company as Fred ``Bonehead'' Merkle, 
who failed to touch second base in a critical game in 1908. Knoblauch 
is a solid, Texas-raised second baseman who spent his formative professional 
years in Minnesota before coming to the Yankees last spring. Apparently 
this has given him just enough time to acquire the New Yorker's legendary 
appetite for disputation. When a Cleveland runner was called safe 
at first base, Knoblauch stood around arguing with the umpire while 
the ball rolled away. By the time Knoblauch had stopped litigating 
the matter and retrieved the ball, it was too late to stop the go-ahead 
run. Knoblauch's teammates were forgiving, including David Cone, who 
pitched well in a losing cause. When he was with the New York Mets 
eight years ago, Cone suffered a brainlock not unlike Knoblauch's, 
arguing a call at first base with the ball in his hand while two runners 
crossed the plate. Come to think if it, this could be a peculiarly 
local phenomenon. New York, after all, is a city where people argue 
over a cab while the cab pulls away with another fare. That is about 
what Knoblauch did, in front of 57,128 bystanders.
