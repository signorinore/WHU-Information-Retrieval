As the Yankees soar and stumble in their quest for the World Series 
championship, the team's best-known fan continues to do what he can 
to insure victory. He provides pitching analyses, sizes up opponents, 
even wears a team warm-up jacket to games. You half expect to see 
him in the dugout come game time, spitting out sunflower seeds and 
gesturing to the center fielder, Bernie Williams, to shade a little 
to the left. So immersed is Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in baseball culture 
that he has adopted his own version of the no-hitter protocol. (If 
a pitcher is in the midst of throwing a no-hitter, his teammates make 
no mention of it, for fear of jinxing the feat.) With the fate of 
Yankee Stadium now as unclear as any extra-inning ball game, the mayor 
and his aides are silent to the point of being glum. One reason given 
for keeping quiet is that the team has to concentrate on winning, 
as though pesky questions about ball parks might have caused Wednesday 
night's game-losing mental lapse by Chuck Knoblauch, the second baseman. 
Cristyne Lategano, the mayor's communications director, said, ``Right 
now, the best thing is for the Yankees to win the playoffs and then 
the World Series.'' Fair enough. But another reason for not discussing 
the matter is that it continues to vex a mayor known for having an 
answer for everything. How does he reconcile the overwhelming public 
support for keeping the Yankees in the Bronx with the team's intimations 
that it will leave _ possibly for New Jersey _ when its lease is up 
in 2002? The one proposal that the mayor has floated _ to help finance 
a stadium on Manhattan's West Side _ has relegated him to the far 
end of the dugout bench. And recent developments suggest that no Fan 
Appreciation Night is in his near future. There was Bronx Borough 
President Fernando Ferrer's recent release of a slick architectural 
plan to renovate Yankee Stadium. The mayor dismissed the proposal 
as rehashed nonsense without actually having read it, which only ceded 
the moral high ground to Ferrer. Then came this week's ruling by Justice 
Douglas McKeon of state Supreme Court in the Bronx that criticized 
the mayor for creating a charter revision commission with the express 
mission of coming up with a ballot proposal that, by law, would block 
a referendum question on his Yankee plan. To wit: whether public money 
should help finance a Manhattan stadium for the Yankees in Manhattan. 
McKeon's decision to let the referendum stand _ a decision that the 
city's lawyers say is heavy on passion and light on legal merit _ 
is being appealed. And Giuliani may be right in arguing that polls 
should not dictate policy and that the referendum is a vote-getting 
ploy by Peter Vallone, the City Council speaker and the Democratic 
candidate for governor. But the sentimental defense of Yankee Stadium 
that McKeon included in his ruling reflects the emotional tide that 
the mayor finds himself swimming against. All he could do was condemn 
the judge as a Democratic hack and Vallone as a political panderer. 
``To reduce the city's negotiating position at a critical time with 
the Yankees,'' Giuliani said Thursday, ``in order to get a couple 
of votes in a gubernatorial election _ I really think you should be 
ashamed of yourself.'' His is such a lonely position that not even 
his fellow Republican George Pataki, Vallone's opponent, has offered 
a teammate's pat on the back. ``They belong in the Bronx, period,'' 
the governor said of the Yankees two weeks ago. As for the West Side 
site, which involves state land that he controls, the governor said, 
``There are a great many factors that argue strongly against that 
site.'' On Thursday, Ms. Lategano sought common ground with the governor, 
saying that Giuliani also wanted the team to stay in the Bronx, and 
that no proposal was concrete. ``You have to keep both options open, 
the Bronx and the West Side, because what Steinbrenner has kept open 
is New Jersey,'' she said, referring to the Yankees' principal owner, 
George Steinbrenner III. Such tempered comments stand in contrast 
to the hoopla with which the Giuliani administration touted its West 
Side plan last spring. The Bronx, it seemed, was the past; Manhattan, 
the future. Now, in the postseason, there is a mayor, quite alone 
and enduring daily criticism, who is waiting for the games to end 
so that negotiations can begin. ``I'm a leader, not a follower,'' 
he said the other day, sounding like a baseball manager being second-guessed. 
``I can see, like, three steps ahead.''
