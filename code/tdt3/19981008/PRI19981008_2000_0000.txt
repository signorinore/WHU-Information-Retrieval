This is THE WORLD, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI, 
and WGBH Boston. It's Thursday, October 8th. I'm Tony Kahn in Boston. 
Today, NATO moves closer to military strikes against Serbia. We'll 
hear from Brussels and headquarters of NATO from London where major 
powers are meeting on the crisis, and from Belgrade, which is hanging 
tough. Also ahead, the international reaction to today's House vote 
to launch an impeachment inquiry, bored but concerned. And a new toy 
for kids, Leggos with brains. It's very important that education be 
fun, and so we don't think toy is a bad word. If anything, toy is 
a good word. First, this news. For THE WORLD, this is Alan Down in 
the BBC News. From National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm Frank 
Stachio.
