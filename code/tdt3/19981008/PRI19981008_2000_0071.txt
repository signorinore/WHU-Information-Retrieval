House Speaker Newt Gingrich announced the tally this afternoon as 
the House voted to launch the third presidential impeachment inquiry 
in U.S. history. The House approved an unrestricted probe that could 
range far beyond the president's affair with former White House intern 
Monica Lewinsky. NPR's Brian Naylor says the length of the inquiry 
is also indefinite. It's not quite clear how long it will go. The 
chairman of the Judiciary Committee Henry Hyde has said several times 
repeated again today that he has no intention of conducting a very 
wide-scale investigation. And several Republicans reminded lawmakers 
that Congress, this Congress will be in effect out of business by 
the end of the year so that if an inquiry were to extend beyond then, 
a new Congress coming in in January would have to reauthorize it. 
In the end, 31 Democrats joined Republicans in approving the first 
presidential impeachment proceeding since Richard Nixon's Watergate 
scandal in 1974. No Republicans crossed party lines, although one 
did not vote.
