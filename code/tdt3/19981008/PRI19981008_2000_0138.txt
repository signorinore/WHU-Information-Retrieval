Ethnic Albanian separatists fighting for independence in Kosovo had 
declared a unilateral cease fire. A statement from the Kosovo Liberation 
Army says the rebels have decided to refrain from all military activity 
beginning tomorrow. Serb forces have been fighting the rebels for 
the past seven months. NATO is threatening air strikes to end the 
crack down because of Serbian assaults against civilians. Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright accused Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
today of cosmetic gestures to meet international demands on Kosovo.
