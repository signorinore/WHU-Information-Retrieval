France is calling for a special meeting of the U.N. commission in 
charge of verifying Iraq's disarmament process. Paris denies a New 
York Times report that a French lab found traces of nerve gas on Iraqi 
missile warheads. Sarah Shayes reports from Paris. France is calling 
for a meeting between UNSCOM and chemical weapons experts foreign 
ministry spokesman say so the United Nations Security Council can 
get a correct appreciation of the results of tests by labs in the 
U.S., Switzerland, and France. U.S. findings say traces of the highly 
toxic nerve gas VX were detected on Iraqi warheads. Iraq has admitted 
to trying to develop VX gas but insists it never stabilized it sufficiently 
for use on a missile. Yesterday, the "New York Times" reported that 
French test results corroborated the U.S. findings and accused Paris 
of delaying release of the information to avoid damaging Baghad. French 
government spokesmen deny this account saying the lab results are 
inconclusive. For NPR News, I'm Sarah Shayes in Paris.
