A federal judge has rejected an emergency request that a feeding tube 
be reinserted into a Virginia man suffering from severe brain damage. 
NPR's Chad Pergram reports. Hugh Fenn lives in a suburban Washington 
D.C. nursing home and is believed to be in a persistent vegetative 
state after a car crash 3-1/2 years ago. Conservative Virginia State 
legislator Robert Marshall represents the district where Fenn's nursing 
home is located. Marshall appealed a court ruling made last week that 
allowed Fenn's feeding tube to be removed. Fenn's wife, Michelle, 
asked the tube be pulled saying she's confident her husband would 
never want to live in such a condition. Marshall argued that keeping 
Fenn from getting food and water broke Medicaid rules. U.S. District 
Judge Albert Brian heard the appeal by telephone then ruled quickly 
without a public explanation. Mercy killing is not legal in Virginia, 
but a lower court ruled that removing the tube is consistent with 
the natural process of dying. Doctors expect Fenn to live only another 
couple of weeks. Chad Pergram, NPR News, Washington.
