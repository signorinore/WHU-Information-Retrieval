According to a new report, the number of children killed by gun fire 
in the U.S. fell by 12 percent in 1996 to the lowest levels since 
1989. The National Center for Health Statistics said 4,643 children 
were killed by firearms in 1996. For the second year in a row gun-related 
deaths declined almost across the board in '96, including homicides 
and suicides.
