In London, I'm Mary Louise Kelly. After Brussels, Madeleine Albright 
touched down here and the arguments took off. Mrs. Albright and her 
counterparts from Britain, Russia, Germany, France, and Italy have 
gathered in London for an emergency briefing on Kosovo. Together, 
these countries form the contact group that oversees the Balkans, 
but no one's expecting easy answers from today's meeting. Russia's 
representative arrived here straight from Belgrade where he pledged 
support for Mr. Milosevic and threatened that if NATO bombs the Serbs, 
it would lead to a new Cold War. Italy, too, has expressed concern 
over whether military action is legal and whether it would work. Italian 
Prime Minister Romano Prody said today that political solutions in 
Kosovo have not been exhausted. And Germany finds itself in perhaps 
the trickiest situation. With the government in transition and a new 
prime minister on the way in, the German parliament can't meet to 
approve strikes until early next week. Meanwhile, the U.S., Britain, 
and France continue to argue there's already enough international 
support to justify strikes. They're hoping to use this contact group 
meeting to continue to push their position and give the West a chance 
to say they tried everything before being forced to take military 
action. For THE WORLD, I'm Mary Louise Kelly in London.
