And I'm Nened Shebek in Belgrade where Richard Holbrooke is due to 
see President Milosevic for the fourth time in as many days. It's 
far from clear what's new in Holbrooke's diplomatic medicine bag today, 
but analysts here say that Milosevic's regime seems set to stay on 
the same course. In Belgrade, people are becoming increasingly frustrated 
and angry as they stock up on staple foods, drinking water, and search 
the shops for portable gas fired cookers. Signs are appearing pointing 
to air raid shelters and sirens are being tested. But there is more 
a feeling of resignation rather than fear among Serbs who feel the 
West hasn't shown even a minimum of understanding for their views 
and actions in Kosovo. There's a rising tide of anti-Western sentiment 
as President Milosevic's government whips a siege mentality. Most 
Western embassies have evacuated all non-essential personnel, and 
today, even the U.N. Refugee Agency said it will do the same. For 
the first time ever, Belgrade's independent radio station, B-92, dropped 
its rebroadcasting of Radio Free Europe's program in Serbacracion 
today. The Serbian vice premier Voslov Scheche has accused the independent 
media of treason and warned Washington to withdraw its spies, his 
term for independent journalists and local correspondents working 
for the international media. Reporting for THE WORLD, this is Nened 
Shebek in Belgrade.
