For THE WORLD, I'm Andrew North. Still to come on THE WORLD, fun with 
duct tape. So stick around on PRI, Public Radio International. You 
are listening to THE WORLD on 91 FM. Coming up on tonight's program, 
the woman widely considered Indonesian's leading opposition figure 
promises hundreds of thousands of her supporters a more just government 
and better economic management. We'll hear that story next. Also, 
we'll learn about a new way of mining gold that is being developed 
by scientists in New Zealand. The forecast from the Franklin Institute 
calls for the rain to taper off into a drizzle tonight, low 58. Tomorrow, 
Friday, plenty of clouds; still could be a shower or two, high 67. 
This is THE WORLD. I'm Tony Kahn.
