And we have some other unlikely scientific research to tell you about 
today in New Zealand. Researchers have found a way to get gold from 
cabbage. Well, hang on there. The process is called phytomining. And 
here's how it works. Growing plants can soak up just about anything 
from the soil around them. In this case, the researchers simply add 
a little ammonium thiocyanate to what's left of an old gold mine. 
The chemical acts to make the gold soluble, and then the thirsty plant 
drinks it up like Midas. The preferred plants are chicory and Indian 
mustard, which is a relative of our good old friend, the cabbage. 
And how do they get that gold out of the plant? Well, easy. If not 
for the cabbage, they just burn the plants and they smelt the gold 
from the ashes. But don't head West with your cabbage seeds just yet. 
The New Zealanders have not yet found a way to make the process cost 
effective.
