There's concern about the state of the dollar. I'm Richard Griffis 
at the New York Business Desk. The dollars plunge against major currencies 
gathered speed today taking the greenback down to 112 yen for the 
first time since June last year. The fall means cheaper U.S. exports 
and there's concern that that could dent corporate profits elsewhere. 
The dollar's weakness today prompted heavy falls on stock markets 
worldwide. Currency analyst Mark Chandler explains. The dollar weakening 
is significant but it really becomes very significant, I think, if 
it's sustained. If it's not sustained, its impact is just fleeting 
momentary. Banks may get hurt a little bit, maybe some individual 
traders, maybe some investors get hurt, but the kind of move that 
we've seen, the largest single down move in the dollar yen in 25 years. 
It's worrisome I think if it's sustained, if we see more of that. 
I think it's almost a vote of lack of confidence in what's going on 
in the world.
