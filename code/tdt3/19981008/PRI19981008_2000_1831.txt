The House of Representatives has voted for only the third time in 
its history to launch an inquiry into whether to impeach the president. 
The House voted 258 in favor with 176 against. Thirty-one Democrats 
voted for the inquiry. Although the impeachment was expected to pass 
easily, the level of disagreement among Democrats will disturb supporters 
of the president. THE WORLD's Emily Harris reports. Before debate 
opened in the House today, President Clinton urged representatives 
to vote their principle and conscience when considering whether to 
open impeachment hearings. For 31 members of the president's own party, 
that meant breaking with the White House. They supported the Republican 
proposal to hold an open-ended and potentially wide ranging inquiry. 
Some Democrats said they voted for the inquiry because they felt Clinton 
had nothing to hide, and they did not want to appear to be obstructing 
a search for truth. The vote defies Democrat assertions that this 
process is falling victim to partisan politics. For THE WORLD, I'm 
Emily Harris in Washington.
