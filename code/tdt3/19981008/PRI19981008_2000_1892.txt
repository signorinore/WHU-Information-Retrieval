The United States has given its strongest warning yet that NATO is 
prepared to attack Yugoslavia. Special envoy Richard Holbrooke has 
flown back to Belgrade with specific demands and a final message: 
Time is running out for President Milosevic. President Clinton told 
Belgrade to withdraw its troops from Kosovo. Our goal is simple: It 
is full compliance with United Nations Security Council resolutions 
by President Milosevic. NATO must be prepared to act militarily to 
protect our interests, to prevent another humanitarian catastrophe 
in the Balkans.
