Japan has given its first direct apology to the people of South Korea 
for its actions in territory it occupied during World War II. Andrew 
Wood reports from Tokyo. This is the first time a Japanese prime minister 
has apologized in writing to a specific country for something Japan 
did during the second World War and the period immediately before. 
Japan suppressed the Korean language and forced many Korean women 
to be prostitutes for the Imperial Army. Other Asian countries which 
also suffered at the hands of the Japanese will no doubt be encouraged 
by the statement. Saying sorry to Korea will increase the pressure 
from them for Japan to make similar apologies. Andrew Wood, BBC News, 
Tokyo. South Korean president Kim Dae Jung who's in Tokyo accepted 
the apology. He told the Japanese parliament the two countries should 
now look to the future.
