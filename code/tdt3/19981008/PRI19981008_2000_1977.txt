A priceless collection of gold jewelry, masks, pottery, and mummified 
human remains has been handed over to the Peruvian government by the 
United States. Some of the relics date back 2000 years. They were 
found by customs officials at Miami International Airport in 1995 
in a crate marked Peruvian handicrafts destined for Switzerland. It 
thought the pieces were stolen from archaeological sites and museums 
in Peru.
