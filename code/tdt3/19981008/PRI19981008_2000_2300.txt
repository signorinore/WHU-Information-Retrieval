Well, as winter approaches, today's geography quiz may be just the 
answer to those blizzard blues and whites. We head to a small island 
in the Caribbean, only about 35 square miles. Unlike sister islands, 
it's not volcanic. It's formed from coral. The beautiful beaches, 
the diving, the snorkeling around the coral reefs make it an ideal 
tourist spot. And like many of its neighboring islands, the mystery 
spot was colonized long ago in 1650 by English settlers, in this case 
from St. Kits, and eventually became a self-governing dependency of 
the U.K. Few final clues: a large population of its residents are 
of African descent with some traces of Irish blood. And our mystery 
spot also just made the news recently with the arrival of the island's 
newest residents who drifted ashore uninvited. Where are we? Well, 
we'll bring you the answer in a moment.
