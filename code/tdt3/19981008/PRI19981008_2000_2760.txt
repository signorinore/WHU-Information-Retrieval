Now back to the answer to our geography puzzler, that Caribbean island 
made of coral. It's just 213 feet above sea level which may explain 
its newest residence. Here to give us the answer and to tell us about 
visitors is Sarah Griffis of the BBC Science Unit. And the answer 
is Anguilla, which is in the news this week because of a small band 
of surfing lizards. Now biologists have long been puzzled about how 
remote islands such as Anguilla are colonized by animals that can't 
swim or fly there. Experts have put forward many theories, and one 
of the simplest ideas is that the animals float across the water on 
rafts of vegetation, but this explanation was thought to be rather 
unlikely until local fishermen reported seeing about 15 rafting reptiles 
in 1995 shortly after two hurricanes struck the area. The animals 
were clinging to a matted locks and trees which had been uprooted 
by the abnormally strong winds. Having spent over a month at sea, 
the iguanas were then seen surfing ashore. Since then, they've bred 
and they're beginning to colonize Anguilla for the first time. So 
this band of surfing lizards seems to have solved the mystery of how 
remote islands are colonized. For THE WORLD, this is Sarah Griffis.
