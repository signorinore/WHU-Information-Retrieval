Whether it's surfing lizards or falling markets, let us know what 
you think. Call us at 617-868-5750. That's 617-868-5750. Or find us 
in cyberspace. Our E-mail address is theworld, that's one word, at 
pri.org. Again, theworld@pri.org. And on that note of hearing from 
you, we want to share this E-mail message from listener Timothy Kibben. 
Mr. Kibben writes, "This may sound silly, but as I listened to a journalist 
today reporting from Belgrade, I notice he speaks in a manner much 
like Charlton Heston, albeit an Eastern European Charlton Heston." 
In the interest of journalistic integrity, we thought we'd let you, 
the listener, be the judge of just how much alike Mr. Heston and our 
man in Belgrade sound. Here's Nanot Chebek reporting from Belgrade. 
It was warm and sunny in Belgrade today and the city's fashionable 
street cafes were as full as ever as people made... And here's Charlton 
Heston in his most commanding. Great Pharaoh, I stand in the shadow 
or your justice. I am the son of Amram and Yoshabell, Hebrew slaves. 
Well, you'll be the judge. Just ahead, Colombian Gen Xers. This is 
PRI, Public Radio International. You are tuned THE WORLD on 91 FM. 
After this program, stay tuned for "TALK OF THE NATION" with Ray Suarez 
and a remote broadcast from the National Maritime Center in Norfolk, 
Virginia. The center is home to a traveling exhibit about the Henrietta 
Marie, a slave ship that sank in the Florida straits. That's at on 
"TALK OF THE NATION." And then at 10:00, a discussion of paper money 
on "BEYOND COMPUTERS". With ideas like smart cards and digital cash 
still in the experimental stages, the fate of traditional currency 
has yet to be determined. That's on "BEYOND COMPUTERS" tonight at 
10:00. And at 11:00, listen for singer Paul Anka on the "CHARLIE ROSE 
SHOW." That's all coming up tonight here on 91 FM. This is THE WORLD. 
I'm Tony Kahn.
