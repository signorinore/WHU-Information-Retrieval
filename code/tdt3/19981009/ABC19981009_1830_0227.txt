In the midst of all this partisan bickering, what is getting done? 
What's not getting done? Democrats and republicans can't even agree 
on that. Here's ABC's John Cochran. There are some people who still 
think Washington moves quickly. Like credit card users who are deep 
in debt. They've been worrying that Congress was about to pass a Bill 
making it harder for them to declare bankruptcy. This couple rushed 
to a lawyer. We filed forever bankruptcy this month because we qualify 
for bankruptcy now and we won't when the new law passes. They may 
have chosen bankruptcy sooner than they needed to. It wasn't until 
today that the house passed the bankruptcy Bill and it still faces 
an uncertain fate in the Senate and a threat of a presidential veto. 
It's been a slow year for legislation. In the first half of this year, 
33 bills were enacted into law. That's about half the number, 64 during 
the same period in the last election year. Republicans are so worried 
about charges of a do-nothing Congress that they have new ads touting 
its accomplishments, like tax cuts, and the balanced budget. Or health 
insurance that goes with you when you get a better job. But all those 
laws were passed either last year or the year before that. The slowdown 
began in January, January 21st. And you know what happened then. Tonight, 
dark day at the White House. The scandal diverted attention from popular 
issues that might have received more debate and public support. When 
the Senate decided to kill reform, no one noticed, because the vote 
came the day after the Starr report was delivered to Capitol Hill. 
There's a whole host of bills that littlerally, I think, are not likely 
to make it in these last few days, because we just got to distracted 
by this mess. It's not just Congress that was distracted. So was the 
president. Who showed little of his usual skill in fighting for bills 
he wanted. Americans have made it clear they do not want the scandal 
to affect the nation's business, but it already has. John Cochran, 
ABC News, Washington.
