This scandal will be in the spotlight for some time to come, now that 
the house has approved a wide-ranging impeachment inquiry. Linda Douglass 
joins us from Capitol Hill. It has now been a day since the inquiry 
has been approved. Judiciary committee republicans have begun meeting. 
The committee must now decide which of Ken Starr's witness to -- democrats 
and republicans republicans -- but the witness republicans are most 
worried about is Monica Lewinsky and the potential for a spectacle 
in which members are asking her graphic questions about her sexual 
relations with the president. Some republicans would like the democrats 
to just agree to stipulate that Lewinsky's testimony in the Starr 
report is accurate, so therefore, they don't have to call her. It's 
unlikely that the democrats will agree to that. There's one other 
name you didn't mention. I know there's a big question on the hill 
as to whether or not kbk become, the president, would be called. No 
one is ruling out calling the president, inviting him up to testify 
I think is the way they would approach it. Today the lawyer for the 
Judiciary committee on the republican side called the White House 
counsel, said we should start talking and the White House says, that 
it expects its lawyers to begin talking to committee lawyers next 
week. All right. Day one. Linda Douglass, thanks very much.
