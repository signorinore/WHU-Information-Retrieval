More evidence that the global economic crisis is having some very 
local impacts. Namely, on mortgage rates. In just the past few days, 
people trying to get a mortgage or refinance, have discovered a rather 
substantial shift up. Here's ABC's Betsy Stark. There's never been 
a better time to be a home Buyer until this week. It makes it more 
attrae hop hou when th inrest rates are low. What happened this week 
illustrates how the huge sums of money moving frantically around the 
globe, with the touch of a keystroke, can affect what it costs you 
to buy a house. For weeks now, nervous investors looking for a safe 
place to put their money have been rushing to buy U.S. treasury bonds. 
When a lot of people buy those bonds, the rate of return goes down. 
And since banks use treasury rates to set mortgage rates, mortgage 
rates also went down. But this week those same jittery investors have 
been rushing out of treasury bonds, pushing up the rate of return, 
and, pushing up mortgage rates. On Tuesday a 30-year fixed rate mortgage 
averaged just over 6 1/2%. Today, the same mortgage was being quoted 
over 7%, if it could be quoted at all. Yesterday was such a crazy 
day. I had a price change at 11:00, 12:30, 1:30 and 3:45. The turmoil 
has created a mass of confusion for the 750,000 Americans who, right 
now are trying to get a mortgage or refinance one. Some mortgage brokers 
say once the dust settles on this week's volatility, rates will come 
down again. But for the moment, global turmoil means home buyers, 
who had hoped to cash in on the lowest mortgage rates in 30 years 
will have to settle for the lowest in 25. Betsy Stark, ABC News, New 
York.
