In Belgrade today, more negotiations, more warnings, but no action. 
American envoy Richard Holbrooke has arrived to meet again with Slobodan 
Milosevic, using the threat of air strikes, hol breek is trying to 
get the Serbs to pull out of Kosovo. But the Serbs say many of their 
forces have left, and those that remain, have a right to stay. ABC's 
Mike Lee is in Kosovo. These are Serb policemen patrolling villages 
that are mostly deserted now. Western governments are demanding they 
withdraw and allow ethnic Albanians who used to live here to return 
home. But the policemen say the outside world has it all wrong, that 
after all, it is their country too, that they need to be here to guard 
against rebel Albanian fighters who roam the countryside. From here, 
the Serb police can see Albanian gun positions only a few hundred 
yards away. They were ordered not to open fire first or to return 
fire. My men cannot walk freely because of a handful of bandits and 
terrorists. The world should condemn them, not protect them, said 
this lieutenant. These people are among the tens of thousands of ethnic 
Albanians. They are afraid to return, even though their village is 
just a few miles away. This police checkpoint is a symbol of terror 
to the Albanians, only a few dare to return to pick up belongings 
and rush back to the hills. "If we come back to the village to live", 
they will arrest us, they will beat us. Some of the help under discussion 
for Kosovo includes bringing in international ground troops to keep 
the peace. If foreign forces do arrive, they will face the difficult 
task of convincing the Albanians it's peaceful enough for them to 
come home, and convincing the Serb police it's peaceful enough for 
them to leave. Mike Lee, ABC News, Kosovo.
