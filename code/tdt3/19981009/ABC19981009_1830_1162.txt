The state of Montana, by nature, is a beautiful and rather remote 
place. It's where you go to get away from it all. In Glacier national 
park, near the Canadian border, there is one sight in particular you 
may want to visit -- when nature calls. After all, it cost $1 million 
of "your money." Here's ABC's Jane Clayson. 7,000 feet up, on a rugged 
trail, six and a half miles from the nearest road, the national park 
service has built an outhouse that cost you $1 million. Why is it 
so expensive? It has taken hundreds of horse rides and more than 800 
helicopter drops just to haul enough supplies to build the outhouse. 
It's not an outhouse. What is it? It's a whole septic system that 
you have back in your municipality. This old outhouse was not good 
for the environment and the park service was facing a legal challenge 
to fix it. But did taxpayers have to spend so much? The cost of concrete, 
say, is $60 to $80 a yard below, but by the time we get it up here 
it's close to $1800 to $2,000. That didn't stop the park service. 
And neither did the fact that the toilets will be used by hikers who 
stay at one of two privately operated historic chalets. They have 
also been renovated with your taxes to the tune of $3 million. Last 
spring, under pressure from Congress, the park service admitted it 
was wasting money on projects like this one and vowed to clean up 
its act in the future. Is it expensive? Sure. Would we do it again 
under the new system? If we looked strictly at the bottom line, perhaps 
not. But the money has already been spent on an outhouse that is accessible 
to a few thousand hikers only three months a year. This is $1 million 
of "your money." Jane Clayson, ABC News, Glacier national park.
