Syria has asked the United States to take what it called an objective 
stand in its dispute with Turkey, the official Syrian newspaper Al-Thawra 
reported Friday. Washington should ``take a balanced and clear position 
toward the provocative statements made by Turkish officials,'' it 
quoted Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa as telling U.S. Assistant 
Secretary of State Martin Indyk. The two spoke by telephone Thursday. 
Ankara has accused Syria of hosting and aiding Kurdish rebels who 
are fighting for autonomy in Turkey. On Wednesday, Turkey demanded 
that Syria expel the rebels or ``face the consequences.'' Syria denies 
the charges, but the row has sparked fears in the region of a war. 
Both Egypt and Iran have embarked on efforts at mediation. On a visit 
Thursday to Cairo, Egypt, Indyk urged Syria to ``take seriously'' 
Turkey's concerns and said they should be addressed on an ``urgent 
basis.'' He called on Turkey to show restraint.
