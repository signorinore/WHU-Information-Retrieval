An accord among the parties vying for a stake in Telecom Italia SpA's 
digital TV platform Stream appears one step closer, Italian newspapers 
reported Friday. Officials at Telecom weren't immediately available 
for comment. Italian financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported Friday 
that agreement has come on the size of the stakes. The question of 
how much Rupert Murdoch's British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC will 
own has been a sticking point. According to Sole, Murdoch will accept 
a 20 percent stake in Stream, considerably lower than his first request 
for a 40 percent stake. France's Canal Plus SA, which controls existing 
Italian digital provider Telepiu, will get a 15 percent stake which 
may later be turned over to Murdoch, the report said. State television 
RAI was expected to get a 14 percent stake. Telecom will retain 51 
percent of its digital pay-TV unit Stream. Telecom now owns 100 percent.
