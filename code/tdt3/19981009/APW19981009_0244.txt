Israel will withhold an award from an Italian insurance company that 
has refused to release information on Holocaust era policies, an adviser 
to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday. Bobby Brown, Netanyahu's 
adviser on diaspora affairs, said Assicurazioni Generali has not complied 
with requests to release information on 337,000 World War II policies. 
The company's president was to receive an award at an economic conference 
Wednesday for Generali's contribution to the Israeli economy. Generali 
could still receive the award if it agrees in writing before the conference 
to release the information, Brown said. ``My deepest wish is to give 
them the prize,'' Brown said. ``I've stated what we look at as the 
minimum for what we need to give the prize.'' Brown said Generali 
had not given any sign it would act before the prime minister's ``Jubilee 
Business Conference'' next week. Generali, Italy's largest insurer, 
had provided information on the policies about six months ago to Yad 
Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial and research institute. The chairman 
of the Yad Vashem, Avner Shalev, said last month that at least 100,000 
of those policies were taken out by Jews. Under the terms of the agreement, 
Yad Vashem cannot publish the information, but may only use it for 
its own research. Generali President Antoine Bernheim is among dozens 
of international business leaders are to receive the ``Jubilee Award'' 
on Wednesday. Generali spent dlrs 320 million in 1997 to acquire a 
majority position in Midgal, an Israeli insurance company.
