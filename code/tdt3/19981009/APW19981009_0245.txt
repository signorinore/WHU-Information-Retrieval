Police have allowed jailed former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim 
to meet with his wife and children, a family aide said Friday. Azizah 
Ismail, Anwar's wife, took their six children, aged 6 to 19, to federal 
police headquarters Thursday night to meet with the country's former 
No. 2 leader. The aide did not say how long the meeting lasted. Since 
his arrest Sept. 20, Anwar's family had been allowed to see him only 
once previously. Police allowed a brief private meeting before Anwar 
was taken to a courtroom for one of his pre-trial proceedings. The 
family made repeated pleas for another visit. Anwar, 51, was arrested 
under the Internal Security Act, which allows jail without trial, 
after two weeks of rallies around Malaysia, where he called for political 
reform and an end to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year rule. 
Mahathir fired Anwar as his deputy and finance minister on Sept. 2, 
saying the one-time heir apparent was morally unfit to lead. Anwar 
says he was sacked because of his rising popularity. Anwar has since 
been charged with corruption and illegal homosexual acts. He has pleaded 
innocent to all the charges and is to stand trial beginning Nov. 2. 
Meanwhile, Yaakob Amin, the head of Malaysia's criminal investigation 
department, said police would not allow Anwar's lawyers to meet him 
until they receive permission from the Attorney General's office. 
``To my knowledge, Anwar's lawyers have yet to meet with the Attorney 
General's office to discuss who among them should meet Anwar,'' Yaakob 
was quoted as saying in the Malay-language newspaper Utusan Melayu 
Friday. When Anwar appeared in the High Court Monday, a judge assured 
defense lawyers that any three of Anwar's eight lawyers could meet 
with the jailed dissident without restriction to prepare for the upcoming 
trial. Except for brief meetings in court, however, Anwar's defense 
team has been denied access to their client. On Thursday, his lawyers 
filed a habeas corpus appeal in the High Court demanding Anwar's release. 
``We claim that his detention is illegal and we'll prove that in court,'' 
one of Anwar's lawyers, Pawancheek Marican said, adding an early hearing 
date had been requested.
