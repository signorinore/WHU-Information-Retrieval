Seventy-five immigrants who paid dlrs 2,000 for passage to Italy on 
board what authorities described as ``a floating coffin'' were dumped 
on the beach of a British base in southern Cyprus, officials at the 
base said Friday. The immigrants, including a baby born on board the 
boat, arrived on the eastern Mediterranean island Thursday afternoon 
after drifting at sea, a statement from the base said. The group included 
10 women, 19 children and four other infants, the statement said. 
The boat left from an unidentified Lebanese port and the immigrants 
were of ``Middle East origin,'' base authorities said, but there were 
no further details on their nationalities. It was the second time 
in less than four months that a boat of illegal immigrants has arrived 
in Cyprus. In June, 112 people, most of them from Africa and the Middle 
East, paid about dlrs 4,000 for passage from the Lebanese port of 
Tripoli to Italy. They were rescued after their boat broke down off 
southern Cyprus. Most have been sent back to their countries of origin. 
The 75 people left the boat Thursday after it apparently broke down 
and pulled up near the Cypriot coast. Authorities at the base detained 
six other people on board the boat, the statement said. ``It is no 
exaggeration to call this vessel a floating coffin. It leaks badly, 
is mechanically unsound and would have foundered if the weather had 
been any worse,'' the statement quoted Andy Livingstone, the base's 
chief customs officer, as saying. The statement said each person paid 
dlrs 2,000 for passage. It was not immediately clear how long they 
were at sea or what caused the boat to break down. The boat was towed 
to the base's port. Cyprus usually deports illegal immigrants.
