Switzerland will publish the names of the 51,000 refugees it took 
in during World War II, the government said Friday. The names will 
appear on the Internet and in book form, the ruling coalition cabinet 
said in a written reply to a lawmaker's question. No date was given 
for the publication, which the government said would be ``useful to 
enrich the knowledge of Swiss history in this period.'' Swiss data 
protection law will have to be altered before it goes ahead. The list 
of names from police files between 1939 and 1945 is already available 
for historical research in a database at the Swiss Federal Archive. 
It also has been given to Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial and 
the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Full information is not yet available 
for the number of refugees taken in between 1933, when Adolf Hitler 
came to power in Germany, and 1939, the government said. Surrounded 
by Germany, Nazi-occupied France and Nazi-allied Italy, wartime Switzerland 
took in nearly 30,000 Jews. But it turned away an equal number, many 
of them to a certain death. The committee of independent historians 
set up to investigate Switzerland's wartime past will publish next 
spring a report investigating Switzerland's refugee policy during 
the period. The report follows the panel's studies on Swiss gold dealings 
with Nazi Germany, published in November and May.
