The NATO allies sought to pressure Russia into ending its opposition 
to using force in Kosovo Friday. The meeting of the 16 NATO ambassadors 
with the Russian envoy to the alliance came a day after Washington 
made another bid to end the Kosovo violence peacefully though Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
airstrikes were near. The allies were searching for an adequate legal 
basis for such strikes other than a new U.N. Security Council resolution. 
The latter would allow Russia to veto such strikes. But divisions 
remained within NATO on that point, too. Italy has cast doubts on 
the assertions of NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Albright 
that no new U.N. resolution was necessary. While insisting conditions 
were not ripe for a military strike, Italy's Premier Romano Prodi 
said any intervention must ``be legitimated'' by the council. ``We 
do not believe that the chances of a political solution have been 
exhausted,'' he said Thursday. And in Germany, the Greens party, which 
is about to enter the national government, also sounded hesitant. 
``We want to keep NATO from giving itself a mandate,'' according to 
Greens defense expert Angelika Beer said. Greece and Spain have also 
shown hesitation but appeared to have moved to the notion that no 
new U.N. decision was needed for an allied military campaign. On Friday, 
officials said the NATO ambassadors were bound to meet into the weekend 
to discuss a common ``legal basis'' for airstrikes. NATO military 
officials have repeatedly said the alliance is ready to launch an 
airstrike as soon as it gets the green light.
