Akira Kawamata shot a 2-under-par 70 Friday and took a one-stroke 
lead midway through the 50 million yen (dlrs 407,000) Japan PGA Senior 
Championship. The 51-year-old Kawamata, who has yet to win on the 
senior tour, shot four birdies and two bogeys for a two-round total 
of 3-under 141 on the 6,749-yard, par-72 Shimoakima Country Club course. 
Haruo Yasuda also shot a 70 and shared second place at 142 with overnight 
leader Teruo Sugihara, who carded a 72. Yasuda is in contention for 
his fourth victory on the senior tour, while Sugihara is seeking his 
seventh. Both players have yet to win this season. Another stroke 
back at 143 were Ichiro Teramoto, Taiwan's Kuo Chie-hsiung and Koji 
Nakajima. A total of 67 players survived the cut at 10-over 154. The 
winner will collect 7.5 million yen (dlrs 61,000).
