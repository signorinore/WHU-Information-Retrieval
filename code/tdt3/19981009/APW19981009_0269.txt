Deep sadness and outbursts of anger set the mood Friday for survivors 
of a pleasure boat tragedy in which 20 French tourists drowned in 
a lake in northeastern Spain. ``I don't really know what is going 
to happen now and I don't really care,'' said Jean Loulier staring 
at his breakfast at the tour group's hotel in this seaside resort. 
Loulier, 70, like many of the 141 vacationing retirees who opted for 
a boat trip around the nearby tranquil Lake Banyoles, had felt lucky 
when he won a discount price vacation. ``Most was free, but the excursions 
we paid, like the one yesterday,'' said the widowed former schoolteacher 
whose female traveling companion, who he did not identify, could not 
swim and drowned. The electric-powered catamaran was pulling away 
from its mooring for a half hour trip over the mountain-surrounded 
lake, 565 kilometers (350 miles) northeast of Madrid, when its stern 
began to sink. It went down fast. Officials said overloading appeared 
the most likely cause, as 141 tickets were sold for a boat only authorized 
to carry 80 passengers. In the provincial capital of Girona, a judge 
was to hear testimony from the directors of the La Carpa firm which 
owns the catamaran, while police underwater divers resumed work to 
bring the craft to shore. The search also continued for two people 
authorities believe may have gone on the doomed excursion but have 
yet to be accounted for. ``Just greed, greed'' said one survivor who 
also raged about the lack of consideration for the tourists in the 
wake of the tragedy. ``I had to go to a public phone box to call my 
daughter,'' he said before realizing he was talking to a reporter. 
``Journalist!'' he shouted, and began pushing this reporter out of 
the hotel and ripping her notepad into shreds. But some wanted to 
tell the story. ``It was like the Titantic, the way it went down'' 
said Evelyn Bengoechea, 52. She survived by grabbing a life preserver 
shaped like a ring after her husband, who could swim, pushed her out 
of the boat. ``I want to thank the people who helped pull us out,'' 
she said. Michel Evielle, 50, has been driving tourist buses for 17 
years. He was drinking coffee by the lakeside when the boat began 
to sink. ``It went down in 30 seconds,'' he said, recalling how he 
helped pull out the floundering passengers. ``Some of those who could 
swim were carrying others who couldn't, and then others would grab 
onto their backs.'' Meanwhile, French Tourism Minister Michele Demessine 
visited the 21 people remaining in hospital Friday and was to meet 
other survivors at their hotel. Two of the injured were said to be 
in serious condition, but the remainder were expected to be allowed 
to travel back to France on Friday. Repatriation of the corpses was 
also set to begin later in the day.
