Efforts intensified Friday to protect the wilderness coast of New 
Zealand's isolated Stewart Island from an oil slick as the first fouled 
wildlife was discovered, authorities said. The oil came from the South 
Korean fishing ship Dong Won 529, which sank Thursday, two days after 
running aground on rocks near the Breaksea Islands. Surging seas caused 
the rocks to rip a hole in the hull. The ship's 38 crew members were 
evacuated. Maritime Safety Authority officers said Friday that birds 
had been found covered in oil from the slick, which was up to 5 miles 
(8 kilometers) long and 2 miles (3 kilometers) wide, on the ocean 
surface. Oil also had washed up on Stewart Island, authority chief 
Russell Kilvington said. Penguins, thousands of muttonbirds, brown 
kiwis, seals and a wide range of other bird and sea life lived in 
the area where the ship sank. Fog rolled around the site Friday, forcing 
back helicopters that had been spraying dispersing agents on to the 
slick. Boats continued to spread the oil-fighting chemicals. ``While 
we're frustrated by the fog, what we have applied has had quite a 
positive impact,'' Kilvington said. ``It's certainly not a major ecological 
disaster at the present time.'' Divers had plugged holes in the wreck's 
hull, and little or no oil was now escaping, he said. The Dong Won 
had been carrying 360 metric tons of diesel and more than 100 metric 
tons of lubricating and hydraulic oil when it went aground. Kilvington 
said the immediate focus was on protecting the threatened Stewart 
Island dotterell and other wildlife. Only 100 of the rare birds are 
believed to remain in the area. He said the oil had reached the high 
tide mark on Stewart Island, but dispersants had succeeded in keeping 
most of the slick from reaching the coast. Dispersants were also being 
used to keep the slick from reaching nearby Patterson Inlet, which 
contains mussel, salmon and oyster farms, as well as paua (abalone) 
beds and crayfish fisheries. Kilvington said the Korean owner of the 
ship would be asked to pay for the anti-fouling operation, which had 
already cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Kilvington earlier 
warned that the wreck could lead to New Zealand's worst-ever shoreline 
pollution disaster. There has been no serious oil leak at sea in the 
country.
