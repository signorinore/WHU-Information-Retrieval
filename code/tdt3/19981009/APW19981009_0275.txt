Afghanistan's Taliban army declined an invitation Friday by the United 
Nations special envoy to come to Pakistan to negotiate an end to the 
standoff between the religious militia and neighboring Iran. The U.N. 
envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, said he can't go to Afghanistan citing security 
reasons and instead asked the Taliban to send a representative to 
Pakistan. ``We will not send a representative, he should come to Afghanistan,'' 
said Abdul Hai Mutmayan, a spokesman for the Taliban army reached 
at the militia's headquarters in southern Kandahar. Mutmayan rejected 
U.N. security concerns saying, ``that's a lie. It is secure in Kandahar.'' 
But Brahimi said Thursday when he arrived in Pakistan from Iran that 
the U.N. has forbidden all international staff from traveling to Afghanistan. 
The United Nations pulled its international staff out of Afghanistan 
on Aug. 21, after an Italian staffer was shot and killed in apparent 
retaliation for U.S. missile strikes a day earlier against suspected 
terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan. Since then the U.N. has been 
negotiating with the Taliban for its return.
