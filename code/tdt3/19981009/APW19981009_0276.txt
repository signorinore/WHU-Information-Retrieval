Sudanese rebels extended a cease-fire in parts of southern Sudan for 
three more months to allow humanitarian aid to continue to flow to 
their hungry countrymen. The Sudan People's Liberation Army said the 
cease-fire, covering the provinces of Bahr el-Ghazal and Western Upper 
Nile, would be extended from 3 p.m. (1300 GMT) Wednesday when the 
current three-month truce expires. The rebels said in a statement 
issued in Nairobi, Kenya late Thursday they made the unilateral decision 
because they were ``deeply concerned by the continuing humanitarian 
tragedy in Bahr el-Ghazal and other areas.'' There was no immediate 
comment from the Sudanese government on whether it would also extend 
the current cease-fire, which it has said applies to all of southern 
Sudan. The government canceled talks, scheduled for this week, on 
renewing the cease-fire, complaining the rebels had exploited it to 
shift forces to Eastern Equatoria, the scene of current fighting. 
State-run radio said Friday Sudanese forces have fended off rebel 
attacks on Juba, the second largest city under government control 
in the south. The government also regained control of the road linking 
it to a nearby army camp, Omdurman radio reported. The SPLA sustained 
heavy losses in the clashes Thursday near Juba, said an army communique 
read on the radio. It did not provide casualty figures for either 
side. ``Our forces were able ... to complete the cleansing and purging 
of this sector _ all of it _ by force and strong will,'' it said. 
The SPLA has been engaged in a new offensive with government forces 
in the southern province of East Equatoria since Sept. 14 and made 
repeated advances around Juba in recent weeks. The town is 1,200 kilometers 
(740 miles) south of Khartoum. The rebels, from mostly Christian and 
animist southern Sudanese, have fought the Islamic-controlled government 
for 15 years to gain greater autonomy. The civil war often has led 
to famine because rebels or government-backed militia burn or steal 
crops to deny food to their enemies. About 1.5 million people have 
died in the fighting and famines. David Fletcher, U.N. World Food 
Program coordinator for southern Sudan, welcomed the rebels' extension 
of the cease-fire, and expressed hope the government would follow 
suit. ``The cease-fire helps us with access and it also avoids population 
movements,'' which have worsened the famine, he said. The famine has 
subsided in recent months, but is not yet over, the United Nations 
has said. The World Food Program and other agencies are pushing for 
an expansion of the cease-fire zone.
