The Justice Ministry will release 10,000 people held in connection 
with the 1994 genocide whose files contain no concrete evidence against 
them, Radio Rwanda said Friday. The state-run radio quoted Justice 
Minister Faustin Ntezilyayo as saying prosecutors and defense ministry 
officials discussed the plan Thursday. The radio said 120,000 people 
were being held in connection with the extremist Hutu government-organized 
slaughter of half a million people, including minority Tutsis and 
politically moderate Tutsis. The International Committee of the Red 
Cross puts the figure at 126,000 detainees. Ntezilayayo was quoted 
by the radio as saying that those whose files contain only their names, 
date and places of birth and other personal information would be released, 
but he did not say when nor how many at a time would be set free. 
More than 330 people have been tried in Rwanda in connection with 
the genocide, and 116 have been sentenced to death. At least 22 have 
been executed. In the aftermath of the mass killings, many people 
were detained on a simple accusation. The country's legal system was 
in shambles after four years of civil conflict, and many of the judges 
and court officials had either fled or been killed. There has been 
strong international pressure on Rwanda to do something about the 
severe overcrowding in prisons where detainees in pink cotton shorts 
and shirts are packed into small spaces with no indication when or 
if they cases will ever come to trial. A U.N. International Criminal 
Tribunal on Rwanda based in neighboring Tanzania, which is trying 
some of the alleged masterminds of the genocide, has convicted one 
person, who has appealed. A second person pleaded guilty. The tribunal, 
whose harshest sentence is life in prison, is holding 31 people in 
custody.
