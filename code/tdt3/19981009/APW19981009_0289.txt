French lawmakers opened debate Friday on a controversial bill that 
would give legal status to unmarried couples, including homosexuals 
_ a move opponents fear will undermine the traditional family. Rightist 
deputies were expected to file up to 800 amendments in a move to trip 
up passage of the bill, sponsored by the Socialists who, along with 
their leftist allies, dominate the 577-seat National Assembly. The 
Civil Solidarity Pact, or PACS, ``is not a sub-marriage, a clone or 
a quasi-marriage,'' Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou told lawmakers. 
``It is not a solemn act like marriage,'' she said. PACS provides 
fiscal and social advantages to homosexual couples and unwed heterosexual 
couples. It reaches the National Assembly after a decade of lobbying 
by homosexual groups and heated debate over the issue. Religious leaders 
_ Roman Catholic, Jewish and Muslim _ oppose PACS, along with most 
rightist politicians and various associations in favor of the family 
or against abortion. They all fear such a law would diminish marriage 
by giving the state's blessing to non-traditional unions. Riding beneath 
the surface is the fear that PACS will open the door to adoptions 
by homosexual couples and artificial procreation for the benefit of 
homosexuals. Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin tried to reassure 
opponents of the proposal in a television interview on the eve of 
debate. ``Marriage is an institution ... and will remain so,'' Jospin 
said. ``Adoption (by homosexuals) is forbidden and will remain so.'' 
Homosexual couples will still be forbidden to have children through 
artificial procreation, Jospin said. Alternative lifestyles ``should 
not become, via the law, social references,'' Catholic bishops have 
said, calling the bill ``dangerous.'' The government ``has ceded to 
the homosexual lobby,'' conservative lawmaker Etienne Pinte said earlier. 
Pinte, echoing other opponents, expressed fears the legislation ``will 
upset the equilibrium of society which for thousands of years has 
been based on the family. And the family is a father and a mother.'' 
For Jospin, the bill simply ``takes into account the evolution of 
society.'' Today, in France, some 4.4 million heterosexual couples 
live together outside marriage. The figure for homosexual couples 
is not known. The bill is aimed at providing fiscal, social and inheritance 
benefits for those groups. Among other things, it would allow those 
subscribing to the Civil Solidarity Pact to file joint tax returns, 
diminishing the tax burden; bequeath more money to the partner through 
a lightening of the inheritance tax load; and provide all the benefits 
of married people at the work place. It also would allow a homosexual 
to benefit from his partner's social security coverage. Any two unrelated 
people, even friends, can enter a PACS union, which can be ended at 
will, by marriage or death.
