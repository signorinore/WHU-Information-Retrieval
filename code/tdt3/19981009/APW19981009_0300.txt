Thousands of Palestinians, some brandishing automatic weapons and 
chanting ``revenge,'' marched Friday in the funeral procession of 
a 20-year-old man killed a day before in clashes with Israeli troops. 
In the West Bank's Jordan Valley, an Israeli woman was stabbed to 
death by a Palestinian man outside the Jewish settlement of Tomer. 
Israeli troops shot and wounded the assailant. The violence overshadowed 
preparations by Israel and the Palestinians for next week's Mideast 
summit in Washington under the auspices of U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
In Hebron, funeral services for 20-year-old Amjad Natche were held 
in a small mosque overflowing with thousands of mourners. Many laid 
their prayer rugs in the dust outside the mosque as Koranic verses 
played over loudspeakers. After noon prayers, Natche's body was carried 
for several miles on a wooden pellet toward the cemetery. As the procession 
wound through hilly streets, mourners chanted ``Allahu Akbar,'' or 
``God is Great,'' and three brandished automatic weapons. One masked 
man, a follower of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah group 
who carried a mini-Uzi submachine gun, said he was sending a warning 
to Israel that Palestinians were armed and ready to rise up if Israel 
continued its hardline policies. Several mourners, activists in the 
Islamic militant group Hamas, chanted ``revenge, revenge.'' Natche, 
who belongs to one of the largest clans in Hebron, was killed Thursday 
in stone-throwing clashes with Israeli soldiers. Confrontations resumed 
Friday when several dozen Palestinians, some masked and twirling slingshots, 
threw stones and emtpy bottles at troops who fired a few rounds of 
rubber-coated steel pellets. One Palestinian was injured. In a leaflet, 
Fatah had called for ``a day of confrontations with the occupier.'' 
Tensions in the city of 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish settlers 
have been running high since Sept. 30 when an assailant, apparently 
a Palestinian, threw two hand grenades at Israeli soldiers guarding 
Jewish enclaves in the downtown area. Two dozen people, including 
11 Israeli soldiers, were injured. In response, Israel sealed off 
Hebron, barring Palestinians from entering and leaving the city. Israeli 
troops also clamped a closure on the Israeli-controlled downtown area, 
confining 30,000 Palestinians living there to their homes. The closure 
of the city was lifted Thursday, but the curfew remained in effect 
Friday. Palestinians have also be angered by the laying of a cornerstone 
this week in Tel Romeida, a tiny Jewish enclave of seven mobile homes 
wedged into a Palestinian neighborhood. The ceremony was attended 
by Israeli Transport Minister Shaul Yahalom. In response to the killing 
of a Tel Romeida resident last month, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
pledged to replace the trailers with permanent building. The Fatah 
leaflet cited the Tel Romeida construction plans as one of the reasons 
for renewed clashes.
