After months of haggling between Rome and Brussels, an accord ready 
for signing Friday contains a compromise allowing other EU countries' 
airlines to temporarily use Milan's more convenient Linate airport. 
Transport Minister Claudio Burlando and European Transport Commissioner 
Neil Kinnock reached the agreement Thursday night. The compromise 
allows airlines to keep 34 percent of their flights at Linate until 
transport links to Malpensa are complete. Malpensa is 53 kilometers 
(33 miles) from downtown Milan, while Linate is just 10 kilometers 
(6 miles) away. Airlines with fewer than 18 flights to Milan a week 
will be able to maintain all flights at Linate. The Commission, the 
EU's executive body, estimated that the Malpensa's road and rail links 
will be ready by the end of the 2000. Burlando's original decree, 
presented in February, was rejected by the EU Commission because it 
was seen as violating the European fair competition rules. Under that 
plan, foreign airlines flying in and out of Milan would be obliged 
to move next month from Linate airport to Malpensa. Only the Italian 
carrier Alitalia's shuttle flights between Rome and Milan would have 
been allowed to stay at Linate. Nine European airlines complained 
that poor road and rail links from Malpensa to downtown Milan would 
make their passengers switch to Alitalia.
