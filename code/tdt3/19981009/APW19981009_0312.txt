South Korean President Kim Dae-jung called Friday for a settlement 
between Japan and women forced to work as prostitutes in Japanese 
military brothels during World War II. The statement came as Kim wound 
up a trip to Tokyo aimed at promoting a revival in ties between the 
two countries. Later in the day, he went to the western city of Osaka 
to meet with ethnic Koreans. During Kim's visit, Japanese and South 
Korean officials have stressed efforts to put to rest the animosity 
stemming from Tokyo's harsh 1910-1945 colonial rule over the Korean 
Peninsula. At a tea party at the State Guest House, Kim said settling 
the accounts of the 20th century would include addressing the demands 
for compensation by the so-called ``comfort women'' of World War II. 
``It must be settled, for the sake of human rights and justice, in 
such a manner as to be accepted by the international community,'' 
Kim told about 100 dignitaries. An estimated 200,000 women from Korea 
and other Asian nations were forced by the Japanese army to work in 
wartime brothels. Survivors are demanding official compensation and 
an apology from the Japanese government, but Tokyo has refused direct 
payment, saying the issue has already been settled through peace treaties. 
A government-backed private fund has raised money to give to the women, 
but many still say they want official, direct compensation. Kim did 
not say whether Tokyo should pay the women or not. On Friday, the 
Tokyo District Court rejected claims from 46 Filipino women for 20 
million yen (dlrs 169,000) each in compensation. The presiding judge 
said the international law under which the plaintiffs sought damages 
did not permit compensation demands by individuals, Kyodo News agency 
said. The South Korean president, who arrived Wednesday on his first 
trip to Japan since taking office, was scheduled to return to Seoul 
Saturday. At a farewell meeting Friday with Emperor Akihito, Kim said 
he hoped the emperor could visit South Korea before the two countries 
stage the 2002 World Cup soccer tournament, Kyodo News reported. Kim 
said Thursday that it was ``unnatural'' that a Japanese emperor has 
not come to South Korea, considering the countries are neighbors and 
have had diplomatic relations for 33 years. Kim and Japanese Prime 
Minister Keizo Obuchi on Thursday signed a ``new partnership'' pact 
opening up new areas of cooperation between the two countries, including 
the Asian financial crisis and stability on the Korean Peninsula. 
The agreement also included Japan's clearest apology yet for its 35-year 
colonial rule of South Korea. In a departure from earlier Japanese 
statements of remorse _ which some South Koreans have considered lacking 
in sincerity _ the wording of Thursday's apology was negotiated between 
the two sides and printed in an official document. In a speech to 
Japan's Parliament later Thursday, Kim said South Korea and Japan 
should not forget their 1,500-year history of exchanges just because 
of Japan's decades-long aggression. Economics also played a key role 
in the summit. Japan offered Kim a dlrs 3 billion loan package to 
help Seoul overcome its severe financial downturn. Seoul is struggling 
to restructure its economy under a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the 
International Monetary Fund.
