A transport strike severely disrupted traffic on Paris commuter lines 
for a fourth day and the walkout spread Friday to the city Metro despite 
tough new measures to curb violence on public transport. On Thursday 
evening, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in an effort to calm striking 
train drivers who want protection from juvenile crime announced plans 
for tougher punishment for those who attack public transport personnel 
as well as greater surveillance. For the first time this week, the 
strike affected the Paris Metro, where drivers on the No. 10 line 
walked out after a driver was attacked Friday morning. The strike 
also hit northern France, where train drivers in Lille staged a surprise 
walkout Friday, tying up regional traffic and service on the high-speed 
TGV. In Paris, nearly all suburban traffic on both regular rail and 
high speed commuter lines were virtually at a standstill Friday. Traffic 
was backed up before dawn on highways leading to the city as people 
left home early to try to get to work on time. At the Maisons-Laffitte 
station west of Paris, commuters jumped on any train headed toward 
the capital. ``I don't know where this train is going _ as long as 
it gets to Paris,'' said Alice Longeuil, a secretary. Traffic jams 
stretched up to 20 kilometers (19 miles) outside Paris. The train 
authority, the SNCF, said there would be no trains Friday at four 
Paris stations _ Est, Nord, Lyon and Montparnasse, which serve most 
points of entry into the capital. Several other suburban lines also 
were affected by the walkout to varying degrees. Drivers at several 
stations, including Montparnasse, later voted to end the strike. Trying 
to defuse the conflict, the Socialist prime minister said said the 
penal code will be revised to deal more harshly with violence toward 
transport workers. Aided by police officers, inspectors who currently 
check tickets will be able to verify identities of passengers. He 
also said justice would be swift for suspected offenders. There was 
some relief in the capital with bus services resuming Thursday after 
a two-day walkout. The city's RATP transit system deployed two more 
companies of CRS elite police on their bus lines, prompting drivers 
to return to work. The walkout was triggered by an attack Monday on 
the RER C line, in which a worker was beaten with a spray can after 
he tried to stop youths from vandalizing a station. The attacks, in 
which drivers are jumped by gangs of youths, often happen in poor 
suburbs with high unemployment. Statistics show urban violence has 
risen by 400 percent in the past six years. About 9 million people 
in the Paris area use public transit daily.
