Days before a crucial meeting between their top negotiators, Taiwan 
President Lee Teng-hui on Friday reiterated a call for constructive 
dialogue with China and stressed gradual steps toward reunification. 
In a message released on the eve of Taiwan's National Day, Lee urged 
China to ``drastically reform its political and social systems.'' 
He also urged that China ``take a broad outlook to cultivate a peaceful 
and mutually beneficial relationship'' with Taiwan. ``Based on a respect 
for the reality of our separate rules, we hope both sides can begin 
construction dialogue ... and take gradual steps to seek reunification 
in the future,'' he added. Taiwan is the seat of the Nationalists 
driven from mainland China by Communist forces in 1949. China still 
claims Taiwan as a renegade province with no right to its own foreign 
relations. Taiwan's top negotiator with China, Koo Chen-fu, will visit 
the Chinese mainland Thursday to seek a resumption of dialogue that 
Beijing broke off in 1995 in anger over a Taiwanese drive for international 
recognition. He will meet his counterpart, Wang Daohan, in their first 
get-together since the two held a watershed meeting in Singapore five 
years ago to begin regular dialogue. China wants to move straight 
into talks on political issues, but Taiwan wants to restart negotiations 
on less contentious matters. At a news conference, Chang King-yuh, 
chairman of the Government Mainland Affairs Council, said Taiwan will 
persuade China to resume the dialogue on practical matters such as 
Taiwanese investors' safety on the mainland, before pushing for political 
talks. ``We remain deeply divided on political issues, and if we start 
with the more difficult issues, you can imagine what the chances of 
success will be,'' Chang said. ``The Koo-Wang meeting can be a starting 
point, and then we can start dialogue on all other issues step by 
step,'' he said. Earlier Friday, the government named 11 delegates 
who will accompany Koo to the meeting. The delegation includes Chang 
Jung-kung, a China expert of the governing Nationalist Party, and 
three other members of the National Unification Council, an advisory 
body. The inclusion of the unification council members is viewed as 
an indication Taiwan may be preparing for political dialogue that 
could take place in the future.
