The NATO allies and Russia on Friday jointly urged Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic to end the violence in Kosovo, but Russia remained 
opposed to using force to end the crisis in the Serbian province. 
At a meeting of the NATO ambassadors with Sergei Kisliak, the Russian 
envoy to the alliance, ``there remained a different perception on 
the use of force,'' said a NATO official, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. Russia held to the view NATO cannot force that compliance 
through airstrikes without first getting a specific U.N. mandate, 
according to the official. But, the official said, the allies and 
Russia agreed on ``the importance that (U.S. special envoy Richard) 
Holbrooke has gone back to Belgrade'' to continue his peace efforts. 
``We need to give Holbrooke some time now.'' Holbrooke held new talks 
with Milosevic Friday. The NATO ambassadors were to meet again later 
Friday and, possibly, again over the weekend, to discuss a common 
``legal basis'' for airstrikes. ``NATO and Russia expressed their 
full support for the ongoing diplomatic efforts aimed at securing 
a political solution to the crisis,'' The NATO ambassadors and their 
Russian colleague said in a joint statement after a two-and-a-half 
hour meeting. The NATO-Russia meeting came a day after Washington 
made another bid to end the Kosovo violence peacefully though U.S. 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned Milosevic that airstrikes 
were near. Hundreds of people have been killed and upwards of 300,000 
driven from their homes since Feb. 28 when Milosevic launched a crackdown 
against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting 
for independence from Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. Milosevic 
has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces from the province, 
maintaining they are needed to prevent new attacks by KLA ``terrorists.'' 
The allies were searching for an adequate legal basis for such strikes 
other than a new U.N. Security Council resolution. The latter will 
allow Russia to veto such strikes. But divisions, 4th graf pvs
