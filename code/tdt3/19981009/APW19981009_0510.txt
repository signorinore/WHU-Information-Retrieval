The Justice Ministry will release 10,000 people held in connection 
with the 1994 genocide whose files contain no concrete evidence against 
them, Radio Rwanda said Friday. The state-run radio quoted Justice 
Minister Faustin Ntezilyayo as saying prosecutors and defense ministry 
officials discussed the plan Thursday. The radio said 120,000 people 
were being held in connection with the extremist Hutu government-organized 
slaughter of half a million people, including minority Tutsis and 
politically moderate Hutus.
