Croatia and the Vatican on Friday signed an agreement obliging Croatia 
to return to the church all of its property confiscated during communism 
and to provide financial support for the church from the governments 
budget. Negotiations on the accord took a long time because the property 
seized by Communist authorities of former Yugoslavia _ to which Croatia 
belonged until 1991 _ is substantial. No concrete figures were disclosed, 
but Croatian independent media reported that the Communists confiscated 
apartments, office space and hundreds of millions of square meters 
of fields and forests. In the capital Zagreb alone, the church owned 
dozens of downtown buildings, including one of the universities, ashospital 
and a theater, hundreds of apartments and much real estate on which 
the new residential parts of the town were built, the Croatian church's 
attorney, Zvjezdana Znidarcic-Begovic, said recently. In the late 
1940s and in the 1950s, post-World War II Communist authorities ``nationalized,'' 
or proclaimed as state property, thousands of previously privately-owned 
assets. They particularly targeted suspected members of the World 
War II pro-Nazi Croat government and the church. Communists sought 
to suppress national and religious feelings of all nations within 
the old Yugoslav federation. About 80 percent of Croatia's 4.7 million 
people are Roman Catholics. Signing the agreement, Croatia promised 
to return the property to the church, or to compensate for what cannot 
be returned. The government is also obliged to support the work of 
the church with a certain amount of money, which was not immediately 
disclosed. Last weekend's visit of Pope John Paul II _ who beatified 
Croatia's controversial World War II Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac _ 
likely accelerated conclusion of the accord.
