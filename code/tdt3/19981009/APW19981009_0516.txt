A United Nations agency threatened Friday to stop the process of returning 
ethnic Ossetian refugees to their homes in Georgia unless kidnappers 
release a U.N. official abducted in January, a news agency reported. 
Vincent Cochetel, a French aid worker who headed the U.N. High Commissioner 
for Refugees office in North Ossetia, was seized by three masked gunmen 
in his apartment in the region's capital of Vladikavkaz. North Ossetia 
is located in the Caucasus Mountains of southern Russia, near breakaway 
Chechnya. The UNHCR has been assisting the return of Ossetian refugees 
to Georgia and its breakaway region of South Ossetia, which borders 
Russia. Thousands fled South Ossetia early in this decade, starting 
from the time it declared itself an independent republic within the 
former Soviet republic in 1990. ``The process of the return of refugees 
to their homes in South Ossetia and Georgia became irreversible,'' 
Hasan Mahmut, acting head of the UNHCR in the Northern Caucasus told 
the ITAR-Tass news agency. But he noted the UNHCR curtailed its activities 
in the region after Cochetel's abduction, and may cease altogether 
unless he is released, ITAR-Tass said.
