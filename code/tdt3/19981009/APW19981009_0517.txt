Outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl will fly to Rome this weekend to meet 
with the pope and attend the canonization of Edith Stein, a German 
Jew who converted to become a nun and was killed in the Holocaust. 
Kohl was to fly to Rome on Saturday for an afternoon audience with 
Pope John Paul II, Kohl's office said Friday. He will attend Sunday's 
elevation of Stein to sainthood at the invitation of the Vatican. 
Stein's beatification in 1987 drew criticism from some Jews, who said 
the Nazis sent her to the gas chamber because of her Jewish heritage, 
not because she later embraced Catholicism. She became a nun in 1933 
and died at Auschwitz in 1942.
