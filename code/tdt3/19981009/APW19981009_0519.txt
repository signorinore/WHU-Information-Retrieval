About 5,600 Indonesian illegal immigrants have been sent home under 
a government amnesty since Aug. 31, a news report said Friday. The 
amnesty ends Oct. 31. Illegal immigrants caught in the ensuing crackdown 
will be fined 3,000 ringgit (dlrs 715) and detained in holding centers 
until they are deported. There are about 1 million foreign workers 
in Malaysia, and about 200,000 lack the proper permits. With the deadline 
approaching, ``between 400 and 500 immigrants are expected to be deported 
daily to Dumai in Indonesia from Malacca port this month,'' the Bernama 
news agency quoted Che Mamat Abdullah, the Malacca director of immigration, 
as saying. During Asia's boom years, about 2 million foreign workers 
came to to work in Malaysia's construction and plantation industries. 
Now with rising unemployment and a sinking economy, they are no longer 
welcome. Most came from Indonesia. Others included Bangladeshis, Filipinos 
and Nepalese. Che Mamat said 823 foreigners had been detained in Malacca 
in this year's first nine months for various immigration offenses.
