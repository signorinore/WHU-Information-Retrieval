Four rare black Swans have been killed by hunters while migrating 
over France, the League for the Protection of Birds said Friday. Two 
of the birds, Lea and Hynek, were wearing electronic tags and their 
progress southward was being monitored as part of an international 
scientific study. Two birds were from Czechoslovakia, one of which 
was identified by a band around its leg. The fourth black swan survived 
its wound but died after its wing was amputated. The birds were killed 
in August or September. The League said that the birds, who are easily 
recognizable by their striking black coat of feathers, were shot deliberately. 
There are about 30 pairs of black swans in France. They spend their 
winters in Spain.
