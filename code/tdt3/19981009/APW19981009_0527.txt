The two Libyans suspected of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 
say that they are ready to stand trial, but insist they first receive 
guarantees for their safety. ``We are confident of our innocence. 
We are ready to appear before court because we ... have nothing to 
be afraid of,'' Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi, one of the two suspects, 
told the London-based Arab satellite channel MBC on Thursday. The 
United States and Britain have accused al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa 
Fhimah of the bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people. 
Both men are under house arrest in Libya. Their statements were the 
latest hitch in their proposed trial. The United States and Britain 
have demanded that the two men, who they say are Libyan agents, be 
handed over. In an attempt to break a nearly decade-long deadlock, 
the two countries agreed to an earlier Libyan proposal the two men 
be tried in a third country by a panel of Scottish judges under Scottish 
Law. Libya has accepted the idea in principle, but Libyan leader Moammar 
Gadhafi is demanding negotiations to ensure the safety of the suspects 
and prevent their extradition from the Netherlands, where the trial 
is to be held. Gadhafi wants the men, if convicted, to serve their 
sentences in Libya. Britain and the United States have refused to 
negotiate. ``We are sticking to our rights,'' Fhimah said. The U.S.-British 
proposal ``made us realize we are going to be in danger,'' he said 
in the interview, the suspects' first televised appearance in four 
years. ``Why don't they give us guarantees? What's the problem with 
that?'' Al-Megrahi complained the two had already been convicted by 
Western officials and journalists. Libya was placed under U.N. sanctions 
in 1992 to force it to hand over the defendants. The sanctions include 
an air embargo, an arms ban and a partial ban on the sale of oil equipment. 
In recent months, Gadhafi has said that venue selected for the trial 
_ Camp Zeist, a Dutch air base 20 miles (32 kilometers) southeast 
of Amsterdam _ would leave the suspects susceptible to kidnapping. 
The U.S. Air Force used the base from 1954 to 1993.
