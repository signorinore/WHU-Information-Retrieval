In a major victory for the gay rights movement, South Africa's highest 
court on Friday struck down apartheid-era laws banning homosexual 
sex. The constitutional court upheld an earlier lower-court ruling 
that the sodomy law was illegal, and said men charged or convicted 
of sodomy since 1994 could demand monetary damages and erasure of 
their records. ``Gay men who have been persecuted for hundreds of 
years in this country now have the right to (file) claims from the 
state,'' said Zackie Achmat, director of the National Coalition for 
Gay and Lesbian Equality, which sought the ruling. ``We welcome this 
judgment as an extension of the rule of law.'' Gay rights have been 
protected since the 1994 provisional constitution paved the way for 
a final document approved in 1996. South Africa was the first country 
to ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in its constitution. 
But the laws that criminalized sex between men remained on the books 
until Friday's court ruling. Sex between women was never officially 
banned, but was stigmatized by extension, the court said. Under apartheid, 
sodomy could be punished with up to seven years in prison. Men were 
not even allowed to have casual contact at social gatherings that 
could be construed as homosexual behavior. The former South African 
military practiced so-called ``aversion therapy'' on gay men, applying 
electric shocks to victims while they viewed images of naked men, 
a report on human rights abuses released last year said. ``Just as 
apartheid legislation rendered the lives of couples of different racial 
groups perpetually at risk, the sodomy offense (built) insecurity 
and vulnerability into the daily lives of gay men,'' the 11-judge 
panel said in its ruling. Panel-member Judge Albie Sachs wrote in 
the opinion that the ruling should be seen ``as part of a growing 
acceptance of difference in an increasingly open and pluralistic South 
Africa.'' Since the first all-race election ended apartheid in 1994, 
President Nelson Mandela's government has pushed to end all forms 
of discrimination. The country's military protects the rights of gay 
and lesbian soldiers. Earlier this year, the police were ordered to 
include a lesbian partner under one of its female officer's medical 
insurance. Achmat said the ruling could open up possibilities for 
adoption and marriage rights for gay couples.
