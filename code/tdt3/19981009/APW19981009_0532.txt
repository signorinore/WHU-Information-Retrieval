Nearly 1,000 Islamic extremists took to the streets after Friday prayers 
to call for the death of controversial author Taslima Nasrin. The 
protest was intended to maintain pressure on the authorities to find 
and arrest Nasrin on blasphemy charges. Conservative Islamic groups 
began the campaign after the essayist and poet ended a four-year voluntary 
exile to care for her ailing mother. ``Hang the enemy of Islam to 
death,'' chanted the protesters as they emerged from Dhaka's main 
Baitul Mukurram mosque wearing white prayer caps. They belonged to 
Islami Oikya Jote, an alliance of conservative Islamic groups, which 
has offered 2,000 takas (dlrs 5,000) to anyone who kills 36-year-old 
Nasrin. Nasrin was targeted after a newspaper quoted her as saying 
in 1994 that the Koran, the Islamic holy book, should be rewritten. 
She later said she was misquoted, but she openly called for changes 
in strict Islamic laws to give more rights to women. Nasrin has been 
in hiding since returning in September from Europe and America. She 
is on bail from charges brought by the state, but she is wanted in 
a civil suit that accuses her of offending sentiments of Muslims in 
her book, ``Nirbachito Column'' or Selected Columns, a compilation 
of her newspaper writings. ``I fear I'll be killed by the extremists 
if I appear in public,'' she told The Associated Press in a telephone 
interview on Thursday from her hide-out. Bangladesh Prime Minister 
Sheikh Hasina has said the author should surrender to court and answer 
the charges. Nasrin said she was exploring the possibility of her 
attorneys representing her during court hearings. ``I'm definitely 
going to stay here until my mother dies,'' she said in the telephone 
interview.
