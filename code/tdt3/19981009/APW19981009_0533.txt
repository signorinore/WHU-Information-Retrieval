BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Friday denounced the 
``deterioration'' of the human rights situation in Myanmar and urged 
the military junta to open talks with the opposition led by Aung San 
Suu Kyi. In a statement, the 15 EU countries called for the immediate 
release of all political prisoners and said Suu Kyi should be allowed 
to travel freely around the country. Suu Kyi was under house arrest 
between 1989 and 1995. She has been stopped several times in recent 
months from leaving the capital Rangoon to meet supporters. Earlier 
this week, the military government said it had arrested 54 people 
for staging anti-government demonstrations. Hundreds of opposition 
members have been detained by the government in recent months. The 
NLD won a landslide victory in 1990 elections, but the military never 
allowed parliament to meet. Last month, Suu Kyi and party members 
formed a committee to replace the parliament that was never convened. 
The EU said it hopes ``the Burmese authorities will respond to this 
initiative by engaging in a real dialogue with those parties which 
won democratic support.'' EU foreign ministers are expected Oct. 26 
to vote to extend the Union's sanctions against Myanmar, which include 
a visa ban for government officials, the suspension of high-level 
government visits, an arms embargo and the suspension of non-humanitarian 
aid . The EU last year also ended trade privileges enjoyed by Myanmar 
under a system aimed at helping developing nations.
