Significantly raising the toll from summer flooding, a senior Chinese 
official has been quoted as saying more than 3,656 people died, more 
than 20 percent higher than the previously announced figure. Niu Maosheng, 
vice director of China's flood control bureau, issued the revised 
casualty count before 1,300 people attending a meeting arranged by 
the Communist Party's Propaganda Department in Beijing Thursday, the 
Shanghai-based Xinmin Evening News reported in its Thursday editions. 
Economic losses exceeded 248 billion yuan (dlrs 30 billion), with 
more than 5.6 million houses destroyed and nearly 25.8 million hectares 
(64 million acres) of land inundated, Niu was quoted as saying. More 
than 230 million people _ a fifth of China's population _ were affected 
by the flooding; the worst hit provinces were Jiangxi, Hunan and Hubei, 
which lie along the Yangtze River in central China, and Xinjiang in 
the northwest and Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia in the northeast, 
the newspaper said. The flooding, which lasted for more than two months 
in some areas, was the worst in 44 years on the Yangtze River and 
in decades in the northeast. But the government often appeared reluctant 
to divulge damage assessments, prompting speculation that the true 
number of casualties was much higher. In the last official damage 
report, given six weeks ago after the worst of the flooding was over, 
Vice Premier Wen Jiabao said 3,004 people had died, 5 million houses 
were destroyed and 21 million hectares (52 million acres) swamped 
for economic losses of 166.6 billion yuan (dlrs 20.2 billion). The 
flooding was made worse by years of environmental neglect and forced 
Chinese leaders to confront some of the costs of breakneck economic 
development. The government banned logging in the western half of 
Sichuan province starting Sept. 1 to stop soil further soil erosion 
along the upper Yangtze and its tributaries. Guangxi in the south 
has announced a regionwide ban on logging as of Oct. 15, also because 
of widespread soil erosion, the official Xinhua News Agency reported 
Friday. The widespread flooding forced China to move 50,000 prisoners 
out of harm's way, but not one escaped, Xinhua quoted Minister of 
Justice Gao Changli as saying Friday. ``This can be regarded as a 
miracle'' in the history of criminal rehabilitation, Gao was quoted 
as saying.
