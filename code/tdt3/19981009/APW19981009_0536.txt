BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke tried to 
wring concessions out of a defiant Slobodan Milosevic on Friday, holding 
new talks aimed at getting him to comply with international demands 
on Kosovo or face NATO airstrikes. While top Western officials declined 
to call it Milosevic's last chance to avoid attack, U.S. Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright had warned in dispatching Holbrooke back 
to Belgrade that ``time is all but gone'' for a peaceful settlement. 
Divisions remained among the 16 NATO allies on the use of force, however. 
Germany and Italy, among others, are reluctant to proceed without 
a stronger legal basis for action. Alliance ambassadors failed at 
a meeting in Brussels on Friday to pressure Russia into dropping its 
opposition to airstrikes. Holbrooke, who arrived from London where 
he met with officials of the six-nation Contact Group on the Balkans, 
said Friday that movement toward authorizing the use of force by NATO 
continues ``in a sustained and intense manner.'' ``The situation remains 
just as serious at it has been before,'' he said shortly before the 
start of his fourth meeting with Milosevic in five days. There was 
no indication how long the talks would last, or whether Holbrooke 
would stay into the weekend. Hundreds of people have been killed and 
upwards of 300,000 driven from their homes since Milosevic launched 
a crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation 
Army, which is fighting for independence from Serbia, the main republic 
of Yugoslavia. Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial 
forces from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new 
attacks by KLA ``terrorists.'' The international demands Holbrooke 
was presenting to Milosevic are an immediate end to hostilities, a 
withdrawal of forces and heavy armaments to pre-March levels, allowing 
unhindered work by humanitarian organizations, cooperation with the 
International War Crimes Tribunal, facilitating refugees' return to 
their homes, and the start of negotiations with ethnic Albanian leaders 
on possible self-rule. In addition, Holbrooke was expected to press 
for an international monitoring force to be allowed to oversee compliance. 
The KLA announced a unilateral cease-fire throughout Kosovo starting 
Friday _ a move that will add to the pressure on Milosevic to reciprocate. 
There were no immediate reports on new gunfire or shelling. Milosevic 
has refused to openly declare a cease-fire, even though there has 
been no major fighting in Kosovo during the past week and the KLA 
has been largely routed. He considers the Kosovo rebels ``terrorists 
and bandits,'' and any cease-fire on his part would legitimize them 
as a negotiating partner, one of his associates said on condition 
of anonymity. The Serbian and Yugoslav governments showed little sign 
that they are prepared to bow to international pressure, apparently 
gambling that Russian opposition to a NATO attack will persuade key 
alliance members, including Germany and Italy, to block any action. 
Dismissing any talk of a rift within NATO, Albright said she thinks 
the alliance will agree on an activation order ``in the next few days'' 
that would authorize an attack. On Friday, the NATO allies and Russia 
jointly urged Milosevic to end the violence in Kosovo, but Russia 
remained opposed to using force. At a meeting of the NATO ambassadors 
with Sergei Kisliak, the Russian envoy to the alliance, ``there remained 
a different perception on the use of force,'' said a NATO official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said the allies 
and Russia agreed on ``the importance that Holbrooke has gone back 
to Belgrade'' to continue his peace efforts. ``We need to give Holbrooke 
some time now,'' the official said. The NATO ambassadors were to meet 
again later Friday and possibly again on Saturday and Sunday to discuss 
a common ``legal basis'' for airstrikes. The allies are warning that 
they envision not just one strike against Yugoslavia but a series 
of air attacks, gradually intensifying. ``We have made it perfectly 
plain that NATO's planning is not for one rap over the knuckles,'' 
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told the British Broadcasting 
Corp. on Friday. ``NATO's planning is for, if necessary, successive, 
coordinated attacks which would make sure that President Milosevic 
could not continue to deploy the heavy military that he has in Kosovo,'' 
he said.
