The Russian parliament urged President Boris Yeltsin on Friday to 
reconsider the government's plan to discard the Mir space station 
next year, saying that would finish Russia as a space power. Parliament's 
lower house, the State Duma, demanded that the government keep Mir 
in orbit until a new international space station becomes operational. 
The Russian Space Agency had initially planned to keep a crew on Mir 
until the end of 1999, but decided to abandon it next June because 
of a severe shortage of funds. ``The decision to discard Mir causes 
bewilderment and protests of scientists and experts throughout the 
world,'' a statement by the Duma said. Lawmakers said up to 100,000 
Russian space workers would be left without jobs if Mir is discarded, 
fomenting unrest and destroying high-tech industries that could be 
a base for economic growth.
