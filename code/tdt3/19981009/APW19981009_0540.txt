With attendance and sponsorship falling far short of game point, organizers 
of the Pilot Pen International tennis tournament said Thursday the 
men's portion of the event has been sold for dlrs 1.7 million (U.S.) 
to a promoter in Austria. Tournament chairman Butch Buchholz said 
in a written statement that financial losses for the past two years 
left the organization with no other option. Investors have not reaped 
a penny, tournament president Mike Davies said. ``Our investors felt 
that they did not want to put more money into this event because it 
was bleeding too badly,'' Davies said. ``We did not get the numbers 
right. We obviously spent more money on the event than we took in 
in income. You don't have to go to Yale to know that you're on a losing 
ticket if that keeps happening.'' For the past eight years, the tournament 
has served as a warm-up to the U.S. Open. But in addition to the financial 
losses, the men's event also was facing scheduling problems. The ATP 
Tour planned to shuffle the dates, making it less likely to draw big-name 
players. The selling price will allow the tournament to pay off its 
debts, which amount to less than dlrs 2 million. Davies said that 
when investors came on board in 1997, they expected losses, but no 
more than about dlrs 500,000. The men's tournament will go to Kitzbuhel, 
Austria, where a clay court event was played this year from July 27-Aug. 
2. The women's event, planned for Aug. 23-28, will now take center 
court. Davies said putting on both a men's and women's event cost 
dlrs 6 million, but that it would only cost about dlrs 2 million to 
play host to the women alone. Besides, the women's event drew higher 
attendance this year. ``We are bullish about the women's event making 
it,'' Davies said. ``We certainly think that the public and the community 
supports women's tennis. Women's tennis is very, very hot worldwide. 
There's great demand for tournaments on the women's game right now.''
