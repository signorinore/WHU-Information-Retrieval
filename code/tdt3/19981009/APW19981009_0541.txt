The proposed WBA welterweight bout between Andrey Pestrayev and James 
Page remained in doubt Friday after a legal challenge from a Mexican 
boxer who claims that he should be fighting for the vacant belt. Russian 
Pestrayev is the No. 1 contender for the WBA crown. But after the 
WBA paired him with the No. 3 contender, Pittsburg, Ca.-based Page, 
the No. 2, Jose Luis Lopez, mounted a legal challenge. On Tuesday, 
a New Jersey state judge ruled that the WBA could not award the title 
to the winner of Saturday's Paris bout. ``We are hopeful that the 
fight will go ahead as a world title bout,'' Nathalie Cristol, a spokeswoman 
for the fight's organizers told The Associated Press on Friday. ``The 
WBA had no choice because Lopez was suspended for taking banned drugs. 
Under WBA rules he will have a chance to fight for the title within 
90 days,'' Cristol said. The WBA is expected to rule on the matter 
late Friday. Whatever its decision the fight will go ahead, with Pestrayev, 
the 1997 European welterweight champion, as favorite. The 29-year-old 
from Ufa turned pro after the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, and Saturday's 
bout would likely be his last crack at a world title. Page, 27, is 
21-3 and fighting for his first world title. Spectators at the Paris' 
Bercy arena Saturday will definitely see one world title bout, with 
Khalid Rahilou of France defending his WBA super lightweight crown 
against Washington D.C.-fighter Sharmba Mitchell. Rahilou, 32, is 
a former kickboxing world champion, and defends the title he won from 
American Frankie Randall in January, and retained in July against 
another U.S. fighter, Marty Jakubowski. Mitchell, 28, is 42-2 and 
fights in Don King's stable. Saturday's fight will be his first shot 
at a world title. ``I don't know a lot about Rahilou,'' Mitchell said. 
``But he has never faced a man as quick or as tough as me. Of course, 
I would have preferred to confront him in the United States but my 
victory over him in France will be even more valuable.'' Marvin Smith, 
his manager, said Rahilou is Mitchell's toughest opponent to date. 
``Rahilou has much better movement than the fighters Sharmba has faced 
before. He isn't going to just stand there and wait to get hit,'' 
he told The AP.
