A Dutch court plans to try a former Surinamese guerrilla leader on 
cocaine smuggling charges in absentia if he doesn't show up, an official 
said Friday. The trial of Ronnie Brunswijk, 36, has been scheduled 
for Dec. 10 despite fruitless attempts to extradite him and doubts 
that he will come to the Netherlands on his own. Brunswijk, a one-time 
bodyguard of former Suriname dictator Desi Bouterse who later tried 
to overthrow him, faces multiple charges of cocaine smuggling in 1996 
and 1997, said spokeswoman Tina Zwiers of the public prosecutor's 
office. According to the Dutch daily De Telegraaf, one of the shipments 
contained up to 53 kilograms (116 pounds) of cocaine. Brunswijk, who 
allegedly enlisted carriers for the transports from Suriname to the 
Netherlands, has denied all charges. At the request of Dutch prosecutors, 
Interpol issued an arrest warrant last summer for Brunswijk. But authorities 
have been unable to secure him for trial because there is no extradition 
treaty between the Netherlands and its former colony. They can only 
hope for his voluntary surrender. Falling short of that, the district 
court in the western Dutch city of Haarlem will conduct the trial 
in absentia. ``He knows when he needs to be here,'' Zwiers said. Brunswijk 
led the Jungle Commandos, a group that waged a guerrilla war against 
Bouterse in 1986 and 1987. Bouterse, who ruled Suriname for seven 
years after leading a military coup in 1980, has also been charged 
with drug trafficking by Dutch prosecutors. He has not been turned 
over for trial.
