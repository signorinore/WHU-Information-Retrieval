Iran's foreign minister held talks with Turkish officials in Ankara 
Friday in a bid to defuse a mounting crisis between Turkey and Syria 
over Kurdish rebels. Turkey issued an ultimatum to Syria this week, 
demanding that Damascus expel Turkish Kurdish rebels from its territory 
or ``face the consequences.'' Turkish reports suggested air strikes 
on suspected rebel bases in the Syrian controlled-Bekaa Valley of 
Lebanon were possible. Syria denies the accusations. Turkey's warlike 
rhetoric has raised fears of a regional conflict. Later on Friday, 
Turkey's chief of general staff, president, prime minister and foreign 
minister were scheduled to meet on the crisis. Syria's Kamal Kharrazi 
held talks with his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem and President Suleyman 
Demirel. ``If everything goes right, there may soon be a peaceful 
settlement of the situation,'' Kharrazi told reporters after having 
a lunch with Cem. ``But it is early to speculate on that.'' On Thursday, 
Kharrazi discussed the problem with Syrian President Hafez Assad in 
Damascus. Private NTV television said on Friday that Kharrazi could 
be bringing a message from Assad. Kharrazi said in Ankara that ``the 
important thing is to search for a peaceful solution to the crisis. 
It is the wish of all Muslim countries.'' Iran entered mediation efforts 
in its role as the head of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, 
a 55-member group that includes Syria and Turkey. Egyptian President 
Hosni Mubarak also shuttled between the two countries earlier this 
week. But Turkey has accused Iran of also turning a blind eye to the 
Kurdish rebel presence on its territory along the Turkish border. 
``The rebels enter Iranian territory from northern Iraq and stage 
cross-border attacks from there,'' Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit told 
reporters on Thursday. Cem thanked Iran for its ``brotherly efforts.'' 
Turkish authorities have made clear their preference for a diplomatic 
solution, but Premier Mesut Yilmaz said ending the tension was up 
to Syria. Relations between Syria and Turkey have always been troublesome. 
Syria is concerned by Ankara's plans to build dams on the Euphrates 
River _ a main source of water for Syria. The recent boost in Israeli-Turkish 
military and diplomatic relations has also angered Damascus, and several 
Arab countries. The Turkish-Kurdish war has claimed some 37,000 lives 
since 1984. Ankara has asked Syria to extradite rebel leader Abdullah 
Ocalan, who resides in Damascus according to Turkish intelligence 
reports. Turkey also wants Syria to put an end to its support to the 
rebels, who are fighting for autonomy within Turkey.
