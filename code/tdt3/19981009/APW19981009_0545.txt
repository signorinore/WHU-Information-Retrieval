Thousands of Palestinians, some shooting in the air from automatic 
weapons and chanting ``revenge,'' marched Friday in the funeral procession 
of a 20-year-old man killed a day before in clashes with Israeli troops 
Fifteen Palestinians were injured in confrontations Friday between 
stone throwers and Israeli soldiers who fired rubber bullets. In the 
West Bank's Jordan Valley, an Israeli woman was stabbed to death by 
a Palestinian man outside the Jewish settlement of Tomer. Israeli 
troops shot and wounded the assailant. The violence overshadowed preparations 
by Israel and the Palestinians for next week's Mideast summit in Washington 
under the auspices of U.S. President Bill Clinton. In Hebron, funeral 
services for 20-year-old Amjad Natche were held in a small mosque 
overflowing with thousands of mourners. Many laid their prayer rugs 
in the dust outside the mosque as Koranic verses played over loudspeakers. 
After noon prayers, Natche's body was carried for several miles (kilometers) 
on a wooden pellet toward the cemetery. As the procession wound through 
hilly streets, mourners chanted ``Allahu Akbar,'' or ``God is Great,'' 
and three brandished automatic weapons. One masked man, a follower 
of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah group who carried a mini-Uzi 
submachine gun, said he was sending a warning to Israel that Palestinians 
were armed and ready to rise up if Israel continued its hard-line 
policies. Several mourners, activists in the Islamic militant group 
Hamas, chanted ``revenge, revenge.'' Natche, who belongs to one of 
the largest clans in Hebron, was killed Thursday in stone-throwing 
clashes with Israeli soldiers. Confrontations resumed Friday when 
several dozen Palestinians, some masked and twirling slingshots, threw 
stones and empty bottles at troops who fired a few rounds of rubber-coated 
steel pellets. Fifteen Palestinians were injured. In a, 10th graf
