Russia, upset 3-2 by Ukraine last month as qualifying for the 2000 
European championship began, can't afford to stumble again. Trouble 
is, the opponent this time is World Cup champion France, which was 
also humbled last month in a 1-1 draw with Iceland. And Russia is 
nagged by injuries. England will be another side trying to get out 
of trouble _ 2-1 losers to Sweden last month _ as 20 qualifying matches 
fill Europe's soccer schedule on Saturday. In Turkey, Germany unveils 
its new generation, and in Italy new coach Dino Zoff is wondering 
when Alessandro Del Piero will score again. The pick of the 20 matches 
are: _ Denmark vs. Wales _ Italy vs. Switzerland _ Turkey vs. Germany 
_ Russia vs. France _ England vs. Bulgaria _ Portugal vs. Romania 
In Group 4, new Russian coach Anatoly Byshovets has injuries to strikers 
Igor Kolyvanov and Sergei Kiryakov and will probably field Vladimir 
Beschastnykh and Oleg Teryokhin. Midfielders Andrei Kanchelskis and 
Ilya Tsymbalar will also miss the match in Moscow's Luzhniki stadium. 
``I am hoping for a positive result, our backs are to the wall and 
that is why we will play to win,'' Byshovets said. For France, new 
coach Roger Lemerre gets midfielder Emmanuel Petit back after missing 
the Iceland match with illness. Defenders Laurant Blanc and Marcel 
Desailly return from suspension. In Group 1, Italy comes off a 2-0 
win over Wales with new coach Dino Zoff needing to replace two injured 
regulars against Switzerland: goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi and forward 
Christian Vieri. AC Parma's 20-year-old Gianluigi Buffon is likely 
to be in goal with Alessandro Del Piero and Filippo Inzaghi teaming 
up front. Del Piero is mired in a career-slump with only one goal 
in 16 games for Juventus and the national side. ``Based on what they 
expect from me, people say that I am not at my best,'' Del Piero said. 
``It's normal that people would be waiting for me to score, given 
that it has been awhile. But physically I'm fine.'' Swiss coach Gilbert 
Gress has called up Sebastien Jeanneret to replace Murat Yakin. Striker 
Marco Grassi is also out with a thigh injury. In Group 3, Germany 
opens its qualifying in Turkey as new coach Erich Ribbeck fields the 
new generation with 14 of the 22 with 10 caps or fewer. Strikers Oliver 
Bierhoff and Ulf Kirsten are ready after injury worries. Among the 
likely new starters are: Lars Ricken, 22, Carsten Ramelow, 24, libero 
Jens Novotny, 24, midfielder Jens Jeremies, 24. Ribbeck didn't mean 
to start such a young side but was forced to by injuries and withdrawals 
by old names like Lothar Matthaeus, Andy Moeller, Mario Basler and 
Stefan Effenberg. In Group 5, England is smarting from a 2-1 loss 
to Sweden with coach Glenn Hoddle wondering why strikers Alan Shearer 
and Michael Owen have not jelled. ``It's going to take time to get 
it right and we have been working at it on the training ground,'' 
Hoddle said. Bulgaria, beaten by Poland 3-0 last month, is a shell 
of the club that took fourth in the 1994 World Cup. Coach Hristo Bonev 
resigned after this year's World Cup failure and new coach Dimitar 
Dimitrov this week saw another veteran _ Luboslav Penev _ drop off 
the team. In Group 7, Portugal is fresh from a 3-1 win over Hungary. 
The Portuguese are near full strength for the Romania match with midfielder 
Paulo Sousa back from injury. The only worry is at right back where 
Abel Xavier will probably fill in for injured Carlos Secretario. Elsewhere, 
Italian defender Paolo Maldini will play his 94th national game, putting 
him in a tie for second all-time behind former goalkeeper Zoff's 112 
appearances. Injured goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel is likely to miss 
Denmark's game in Copenhagen against Wales, his first absence in 10 
years. Mogens Krogh is likely to start. Forward Mikkel Beck is also 
back with Denmark after being left off the World Cup team.
