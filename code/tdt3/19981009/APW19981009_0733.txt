An international arbitration panel on Friday ruled in favor of Yemen 
in its dispute with Eritrea over three Red Sea islands, a quarrel 
that had threatened a major shipping route. Eritrea said it will abide 
by the decision. The official Yemeni news agency SABA said Prime Minister 
Abdel Karim al-Iryani sent a message of congratulations to President 
Ali Abdullah Saleh over the decision by the International Court of 
Arbitration, which is based in the Hague. A court official declined 
to give details of the verdict. In the Eritrean capital of Asmara, 
Yemen's acting ambassador, Ahmed Hassan, called the decision a ``victory 
for Eritrea and Yemen.'' ``You may lose something but you win something 
more important: living together in peace as good neighbors and setting 
an example for others in the region,'' he said. Yemen and Eritrea 
both claimed the three islands, one of which, the Greater Hanish, 
was captured by Eritrea in a brief battle in December 1995. Yemen 
retained control of the other two islands, Lesser Hanish and Zuqar. 
An Eritrean government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said Eritrea will now withdraw its troops from Greater Hanish. An 
Eritrean Foreign Ministry statement said the tribunal gave Eritrea 
control of three minor islands and four islets. ``This is the only 
civilized way of settling disputes,'' New Eritrea, a government newspaper, 
said. The islands, where Yemen has granted oil concessions, sit across 
one of the world's major shipping lanes, 160 kilometers (100 miles) 
north of the Bab el-Mandeb strait at the southern entrance to the 
Red Sea. Shipping security in the area is of vital importance to Saudi 
Arabia, which has an oil export terminal in Yanbu further north, and 
to Egypt, whose revenues from the Suez Canal linking the Red Sea to 
the Mediterranean are crucial to its economy. Eritrea and Yemen decided 
in May 1996 to have the dispute settled by the International Court 
of Arbitration, a low-profile panel of international experts. The 
court's decisions are legally binding. The ICA, which arbitrates behind 
closed door, is considered a more discreet arena to settle disputes 
than the better-known International Court of Justice, which is housed 
in the same Hague building. The ICA's arbitration on the Yemen-Eritrea 
dispute was held in London. Hassan, the acting ambassador, said the 
decision leaves Yemen free to develop the islands for tourism, scuba 
diving, oil and other enterprises.
