President Yoweri Museveni Friday urged Ugandans to be vigilant in 
the fight against terrorism after an alleged plot to blow up the U.S. 
Embassy and the bombings of several buses later in August in which 
30 people were killed. ``Terrorism is a weapon of the weak and dispirited. 
Our opponents have resorted to terrorism, and it is an indication 
that our opponents cannot fight government by military means or by 
the ballot,'' Museveni told thousands of people celebrating Uganda's 
36th anniversary of independence from Britain. ``I ask of each Ugandan 
to be at each other's keep. Report anyone who jeopardizes security. 
When our opponents are desperate, they adopt terrorism. They cannot 
get power democratically and begin to strike innocent people using 
terrorism,'' Museveni said. Meanwhile, East African defense officials 
stressed the importance of security as a pre-condition to regional 
unity, peace and stability at the end of a one-day meeting Thursday 
night in Kampala. In a joint statement, they recommended that the 
heads of state of Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania meet at a summit in three 
weeks to discuss the security situation in Congo where a two-month 
rebellion has drawn in at least six outside countries. Uganda maintains 
two army batallions in northeastern Congo to flush out rebels who 
attack western Uganda, but Museveni says no Ugandan troops are involved 
in the Congolese rebellion. On Aug. 7 bombs exploded at the U.S. embassies 
in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing 224 people, 
including 12 Americans. Ugandan officials and FBI agents said several 
weeks later they had uncovered a plot to bomb the U.S. Embassy in 
Kampala.
