The Russian postal service will pay its overdue shipping bills by 
the end of the year to resolve a dispute that has all but stopped 
mail delivery, a news agency said Friday. Russian railways stopped 
carrying most mail Sept. 20 to protest the State Communications Committee's 
failure to pay 160 million rubles (dlrs 10.1 million) in shipping 
costs. The dispute halted 1,000 of the country's 1,200 rail cars carrying 
mail, and left many stranded and stuffed with letters and packages. 
Russians rely heavily on mail as their main method of communication, 
especially in far-flung regions where there are few telephones. Few 
Russian TV networks broadcast throughout the country, so people also 
depend on newspapers delivered by mail for news. Russia's 17 railways 
charge the State Communications Committee, which is responsible for 
the postal service, cheap rates for delivering mail. It said it was 
owed about 210 million rubles (dlrs 13.2 million). The post office, 
which is chronically in debt, says it is owed money by the government 
and others. The problem is part of the overall crisis in Russia where 
a tangled web of non-payment of bills and wages has all but paralyzed 
the economy. The government is the largest debtor, failing to pay 
wages and pensions to millions of Russians or pay for goods and services. 
The postal service will seek bank loans to help pay its debt, Vladimir 
Shelikhov, deputy chief of postal services for the State Communications 
Committee, told the ITAR-Tass news agency. It will also ask the government 
to consider raising postal rates, Shelikhov said.
