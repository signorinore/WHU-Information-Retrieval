Palestinians battled Israeli troops with rocks and firebombs in the 
divided West Bank town of Hebron on Friday just after burying a young 
Palestinian fatally shot with a rubber bullet a day earlier. Twenty 
Palestinians were hurt, including one who was arrested. In the West 
Bank's Jordan Valley, meanwhile, an Israeli woman soldier, 19-year-old 
Cpl. Michal Adato, was stabbed to death by a Palestinian man outside 
the Jewish settlement of Tomer, where she lived. Israeli troops shot 
and wounded the assailant. The violence overshadowed preparations 
by Israel and the Palestinians for next week's summit in Washington 
under the auspices of U.S. President Bill Clinton. In Hebron, near 
the tiny Jewish enclave of Tel Romeida, masked stone-throwers torched 
a car and tried to roll it downhill toward Israeli troops, who fought 
them off with a volley of rubber bullets. Palestinians were enraged 
by the announcement of plans to enlarge Tel Romeida, a cluster of 
mobile homes in the heart of a Palestinian neighborhood. An Israeli 
Cabinet minister, Shaul Yahalom, attended a cornerstone-laying ceremony 
earlier this week. The enclave was the scene of the fatal stabbing 
of an elderly rabbi six weeks ago, and settlers said the expansion 
was in retaliation for that. Thousands of Palestinians marched through 
a hilly Hebron neighborhood in a funeral procession for 20-year-old 
Amjad Natche, who was shot in the head with a rubber bullet during 
a clash on Thursday. He belonged to one of the largest Palestinian 
clans in the city. At the mosque where funeral services were held, 
a crowd of hundreds spilled out into the street. Mourners formed themselves 
into rows and spread prayer rugs in the dusty street as Koranic verses 
rang out from the mosque's loudspeakers. Carrying the body on a wooden 
pallet, the marchers wound through several kilometers (miles) of hilly 
streets, chanting ``Allahu Akbar!'' or ``God is great!'' Several masked 
marchers brandished weapons. One young man, his head wrapped in a 
black-and-white-checked keffiyeh, waved a mini-Uzi submachine gun, 
saying the display of weaponry was meant as a warning to Israel that 
the Palestinians were armed and ready to rise up if Israel continued 
its hard-line policies. At the cemetery, mourners fired volleys of 
shots into the air and burned Israeli and U.S. flags, screaming, ``Revenge, 
revenge!'' Afterward, scores of stone-throwers attacked Israeli troops 
guarding Jewish settlements in the center of Hebron, but the soldiers 
kept them at bay with rubber bullets, and the disturbances died down 
after several hours. For the 10th straight day, troops kept Israeli-controlled 
areas of Hebron under curfew, confining 30,000 Palestinians living 
there to their homes. However, a closure of the city as a whole was 
lifted Thursday.
