Landslides unleashed by heavy rains and floods killed eight people 
in northern Iran, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Friday. 
The deaths occurred on Thursday in Gilan and Mazandaran provinces 
where the raging waters and landslides damaged roads, bridges, farm 
lands, homes and other buildings, the agency quoted an official with 
the Natural Disaster Headquarters as saying. He said more than 400 
families were stranded in the northern towns of Rudsar, Rezvan Shahr 
and Masaleh after floods cut all road links. In April, a landslide 
killed 55 people in a remote village in central Iran.
