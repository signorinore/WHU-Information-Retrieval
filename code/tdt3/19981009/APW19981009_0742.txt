German auto clubs were united Friday against speed limits proposed 
by the incoming government's likely junior coalition partner, the 
environmental Greens. Three national clubs all said that limits would 
not improve safety. The Greens party is proposing a limit of 130 kilometers 
(78 miles) an hour on the famed German autobahn to cut down on emissions 
and accidents. The Frankfurt-based Automobilclub von Deutschland (AvD), 
said only 10 percent of the country's accidents occur on the autobahn, 
and that a blanket speed limit would only increase traffic jams _ 
not increase safety or environmental conditions. AvD said that 75 
percent of Germany's 11,246 kilometers (6,987 miles) of superhighways 
already have speed limits, set by the states. Allgemeiner Deutscher 
Automobil Club in Munich said a general speed limit was unnecessary, 
noting that many stretches already were posted with a 130 kilometer 
(78 mile) an hour limit. And the Auto Club Europa in Stuttgart said 
it has sent a position paper to the new government negotiators against 
the limits. ``People won't stick to it anyway,'' said spokesman Rainer 
Hillgaertner.
