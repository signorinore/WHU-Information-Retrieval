Retiring ski star Alberto Tomba will run his very last race in December 
at the venue where he captured his first World Cup victory 11 years 
ago. Organizers announced Friday that the 31-year-old Italian skier, 
who announced his official retirement from skiing last Saturday, will 
compete in a giant slalom exhibition at Sestriere on Dec. 30. A huge 
crowd was expected to pay Tomba a tribute in occasion of his last 
show on skis. Tomba, Italy's most successful and popular skier, won 
his first World Cup race at Sestriere, in Italy's eastern Alps, in 
1987. Since then the man nicknamed La Bomba (the Bomb) because of 
his explosive style piled up 50 World Cup wins, one overall World 
Cup title, three Olympic golds and two world titles. Tomba, who plans 
an acting debut later this year, will be competing in the Sestriere 
exhibition against seven top ranking World Cup skiers. The race, in 
three runs, will award victory on the basis of the combined time of 
the two fastest heats.
