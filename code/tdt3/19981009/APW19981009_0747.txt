Within three days, forensic experts have found more than 170 bodies 
in one of the biggest mass graves discovered in Bosnia so far, officials 
said Friday. ``We anticipate to find maybe one hundred more'' bodies, 
said U.S. pathologist Dr. Jill Gould, a forensic pathologist from 
Wichita, Kansas, and a member of the exhumation team . Also on Friday, 
forensic investigators exhumed 25 bodies from a mass grave in Vukovar, 
an eastern Croatian city formerly held by rebel Serbs. In cooperation 
with Physical Human Rights (PHR) and the state-run Commission for 
Missing Persons in Bosnia, an exhumation team found the new mass grave 
in the village of Donja Glumina, about 35 kilometers ( 22 miles) east 
of Tuzla, on Serb-held territory. Experts have found civilians clothes 
so far, ``but we have to open some more bags,'' said Gould. The bodies 
were believed to be Bosnian Muslims killed at the very beginning of 
the Bosnian war in 1992. Amor Masovic, the head of the Commission 
for Missing People, said it was believed that the remains found were 
of some of several thousand people missing since 1992 from neighboring 
villages. He also said that the grave was found with the help of people 
who witnessed the burial by soldiers of the former Yugoslav Army. 
One of the witnesses, a 51-year-old man of Donja Glumina identified 
only by his initials R. M., said that in May 1992, he saw trucks with 
bodies in bags and soldiers placing the bodies in the prepared grave. 
Most of the bodies discovered are in military plastic bags, orderly 
placed in the mass grave. About 1, 800 bodies have been dug from different 
mass graves in this area, most of them believed to be victims killed 
after Bosnian Serbs overran the town of Srebrenica in July 1995. In 
Croatia, the 25 bodies were discovered in Celije, a suburb of Vukovar 
near the Croatian border with Yugoslavia, some 355 kilometers (220 
miles) east of Zagreb. Ivan Grujic, who heads a national commission 
for prisoners and missing persons, told Croatia's state-run HINA news 
agency that the victims whose remains were found in Celije were killed 
while the area was controlled by rebel Serbs following their rebellion 
against Croatian independence in 1991.
