Germany's Social Democrats and Greens try to crack some of the toughest 
nuts _ how much to raise energy taxes, and how fast to abandon nuclear 
power _ when talks on forming a new center-left government resume 
Sunday. Both issues are vital to the environmentalist Greens, the 
junior partner in the negotiations. But chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, 
who campaigned promising a business-friendly approach to politics, 
has already signaled he won't agree to anything that might jeopardize 
economic growth. After a visit to Washington on Friday dominated by 
foreign policy, Schroeder heads into Sunday's talks focused on tough 
domestic questions of taxes and energy policy. The platforms of both 
parties call for shutting down Germany's 19 atomic energy plants _ 
a prospect that has electric companies already threatening to sue 
the government for billions of marks. Business leaders also warn that 
abandoning nuclear power would cost jobs in research. ``I think it's 
almost cynical to withhold German nuclear technology from humanity,'' 
said Hans-Olaf Henkel, head of the Association of German Industry. 
Schroeder says he wants to try to reach an agreement with the nuclear 
industry to begin decommissioning atomic plants. Greens leaders though 
are looking for a definite timetable _ and a quick one. Also on the 
agenda is attaching a figure to the energy tax increase to promote 
energy conservation and finance cuts elsewhere. The future partners 
agreed to the tax on Thursday. The Greens argue raising taxes on oil, 
coal and natural gas could create jobs in two ways: forcing industry 
to modernize and seek alternatives, and by financing cuts in non-wage 
costs employers must pay for government-mandated employee benefits. 
``It's not just a symbolic project for us, something to satisfy the 
Green heart,'' Greens party co-chair Gunda Roestel told German radio. 
Yet industry leaders warn higher fuel costs in Germany would make 
German products more expensive and hurt the export-dependent economy. 
``We could end up with a crisis,'' Michael Fuchs, president of a German 
wholesalers and retailers association, told German television Friday. 
Social Democrats insisted Schroeder would not allow a gas tax increase 
of more than 6 pfennigs (3.75 cents) per liter, which is much less 
than the Greens want. ``Schroeder has made himself clear,'' party 
chairman Oskar Lafontaine said. A 6 pfennig increase raises 4.3 billion 
marks (dlrs 2.7 billion). But 15 billion marks (dlrs 9.4 billion) 
would be needed to lower non-wage labor costs _ now at 42.3 percent 
of a worker's income _ by just one percentage point. The center-left 
coalition has said they want to get the costs down to less than 40 
percent of the average-earner's wage. Roestel said other energy taxes, 
such as on electricity production, were still on the negotiating table. 
On Saturday, the Social Democrats' executive committee was to meet 
Saturday to unite behind a candidate for parliamentary faction leader. 
The incumbent, Rudolf Scharping, was expected to get the nod.
