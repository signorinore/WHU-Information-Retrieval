Tajikistan's Supreme Court on Friday sentenced a rebel warlord to 
death for several hostage-takings and bombings in the Central Asian 
country, a news agency said. Bakhrom Sadirov kidnapped 23 people in 
December 1996 and 16 people in February 1997. In both cases, most 
of the hostages were United Nations workers. All were released unharmed 
after the government freed some of Sadirov's supporters. Sadirov and 
an ally, Kiroatsho Nasyrov, were both sentenced to death on charges 
of terrorism and hostage-taking, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. 
Bakhrom Sadirov and his brother Rezvon Sadirov opposed a peace settlement 
reached last year by the government and main opposition groups in 
the impoverished former Soviet republic. The agreement between President 
Emomali Rakhmonov's hard-line government and the mainstream Muslim 
opposition ended the civil war raging since 1992, but sporadic clashes 
with rebel commanders who opposed the settlement have continued. Bakhrom 
Sadirov was arrested in February 1997. His brother Rezvon Sadirov 
was killed late last year in a crackdown on his fighters by government 
forces.
