ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton's special 
envoy to the Horn of Africa left Ethiopia for Washington Friday instead 
of returning to Eritrea as expected for a second round of meetings 
on the simmeering border dispute between the two countries. Former 
national security adviser Anthony Lake and his four-member team arrived 
in the Ethiopian capital Thursday from Eritrea where he began the 
second U.S. attempt to find a peaceful solution to the conflict that 
turned violent May 12. Lake had arrived in Asmara, the Eritrean capital, 
Tuesday afternoon for talks with Eritrean President Isias Afwerki, 
and he had been expected to return after meeting Ethiopian Prime Minister 
Meles Zenawi. There was no explanation for the apparent change in 
plans. The United States and Rwanda attempted to resolve the conflict 
with a round of shuttle diplomacy in June, but the peace plan they 
proposed reportedly annoyed the Eritreans, who were called on to withdraw 
from disputed territory before any negotiations could begin. Eritrea 
has called for internationally monitored demilitarization of three 
contested areas before any talks can begin. Several hundred people 
were killed during cross border air strikes and shelling in early 
June. Both sides have been observing a June 14 Clinton-brokered moratorium 
on further air strikes. Eritrea, a former Italian colony annexed to 
Ethiopia in 1962, fought a 30-year war with Ethiopia and gained independence 
in 1993. The border separating the two countries was drawn up by Italy 
in the early part of the century, but it has not been formally demarcated 
since Eritrean independence.
