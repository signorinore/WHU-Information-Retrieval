The European Commission said Friday that it was taking Greece to court 
for failing to protect rare Mediterranean sea turtles which lay their 
eggs on the island of Zakynthos. In a statement, the European Union 
executive body said the Greek government had infringed EU laws on 
protection of natural habitats by allowing ``disturbances due to tourist-related 
activities'' on beaches favored by the turtles. The Ionian island 
of Zakynthos lies some, 290 kilometers (180 miles) northwest of Athens. 
In a separate case, the Commission said it was taking Greece to the 
European Court of Justice for not introducing tougher penalties for 
smugglers trading in rare animals and plants. The Commission also 
said it was also lodging a complaint at the EU high court against 
Germany for not setting up enough protected areas for wild birds. 
If the European Court finds against them, the two countries will be 
told to fully implement EU rules or face fines.
