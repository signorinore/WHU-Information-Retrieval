A Turkish boy who became an election-year symbol for Germans demanding 
action against ``criminal foreigners'' faced a new deportation threat 
Friday after being convicted of robbery. Although born and raised 
in Munich, the 14-year-old boy, known as Mehmet, remains Turkish because 
of German citizenship laws. Conservative officials in Bavaria created 
a nationwide stir this summer by seeking to deport not only Mehmet, 
who has a long record of juvenile delinquency, but also his law-abiding 
parents, who have lived and worked in Munich for 30 years. Bavarian 
officials charged the parents with endangering public safety by failing 
to properly raise their son. Mehmet's lawyer, pointing to September's 
elections, accused the government of making a campaign issue out of 
a family tragedy. A state court has since blocked the deportation 
of the parents, but Munich officials refused to renew Mehmet's residency 
permit, meaning he could theoretically be sent back to Turkey. That 
likelihood was strengthened by Friday's conviction and sentence to 
one year in prison _ his first after turning 14, the age at which 
youths can be prosecuted. Mehmet and three other German youths were 
convicted of robbery and causing bodily harm stemming from a July 
3 fight with a 19-year-old student. German law allows deportation 
of any foreigner sentenced to a year or more in prison.
