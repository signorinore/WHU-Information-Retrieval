President Boris Yeltsin, who has made few foreign trips in recent 
months, heads to Central Asia this weekend in hopes of increasing 
cooperation with two former Soviet republics, officials said Friday. 
Yeltsin plans to sign a package of economic agreements and discuss 
joint measures to prevent a spillover of violence from Afghanistan 
during his visits to Uzbekistan and Kazakstan on Sunday through Tuesday. 
Despite Russia's economic crisis, Yeltsin has maintained a low-profile 
since the summer and has spent much of his time at a country residence 
outside Moscow. His last foreign trip was to Britain in May, when 
he attended summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. 
Yeltsin plans to meet Uzbek President Islam Karimov on Sunday and 
sign agreements aimed at boosting bilateral trade, cooperation in 
the oil industry, and expanding economic ties, Uzbek officials said. 
``The work in all these directions is going on,'' Yeltsin said in 
an interview Friday with Russian news agencies. ``But,'' he added, 
``we need to work in a more coordinated way,'' Yeltsin goes to Kazakstan 
on Monday, where he and Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev are expected 
to sign agreements on economic, science and technical cooperation 
and on combating drug trafficking. Yeltsin said he also planned to 
discuss the situation in Afghanistan with his Uzbek and Kazak counterparts. 
Russia and the former Soviet republics in Central Asia fear an influx 
of refugees and weapons across their borders from Afghanistan, and 
possibly a spillover of fighting. The situation ``naturally disturbs 
us, and even more so, Afghanistan's immediate neighbors,'' Yeltsin 
said. Uzbeksitan shares a border with Afghanistan. The talks will 
also touch on ``specific measures that we should take together to 
neutralize the threats to safety and stability in the region that 
are coming from Afghanistan,'' Yeltsin said. Yeltsin and Nazarbayev 
are also expected to discuss Russia's offer to build a nuclear power 
plant in Kazakstan, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies reported. 
Under the proposed dlrs 2 billion project, the plant would be built 
near Lake Balkhash in southern Kazakstan. Yeltsin and Nazarbayev are 
also expected to discuss the division of oil-rich Caspian Sea floor 
_ an issue that has divided the five Caspian countries for years. 
The two presidents signed an agreement this summer to divide the northern 
part of the Caspian seabed into separate Russian and Kazak sectors. 
The deal recognized Kazakstan's claim to the oil near its coast and 
set a precedent for future agreements. Yeltsin praised the agreement 
Monday, and called for work on additional agreements. The three countries 
with oil near their coastlines _ Kazakstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan 
_ want the Caspian divided into national sectors so they can claim 
the oil for themselves. Russia and Iran, two countries with little 
or no oil near their Caspian coasts, have wanted the sea's resources 
shared by all. But Russia has been softening its stance recently.
