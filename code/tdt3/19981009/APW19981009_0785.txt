Zurich Financial Services said Friday it is selling its British-based 
Eagle Star Reinsurance subsidiary to GE Capital of the United States. 
Eagle Star Re will operate as part of GE Capital's Employers Reinsurance 
Corp, Zurich announced. Terms of the sale weren't made public. It 
excludes most business undertaken by Eagle Star before 1993. Eagle 
Star Re's net assets as of Dec. 31 totaled 232.8 million pounds. Zurich 
Financial Services, the operating company of Zurich Allied AG and 
Allied Zurich PLC, said the deal is part of a shake-up of its London 
reinsurance operations, which also includes a reorganization of Zurich 
Re London. Zurich Re London's specialities business will be tied to 
Zurich Financial Services' similar operation in the United States. 
Zurich Re London's reinsurance business will be folded into similar 
entities in Zurich Financial Services. Discussions about a possible 
management buyout of Zurich Re London were called off, Zurich said. 
For GE Capital's Employers Reinsurance, the addition of Eagle Star 
Re will boost its position in the British broker market, the announcement 
said. GE Capital is a subsidiary of General Electric Company of Stamford, 
Connecticut in the United States. One of the main activities of reinsurance 
businesses is insuring insurance companies.
