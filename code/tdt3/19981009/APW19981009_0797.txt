The president of Moldova will make a one-day visit to neighboring 
Romania on Saturday to present a book he has written to an international 
fair and to hold bilateral talks, a news agency said. President Petru 
Lucinschini is scheduled to meet with his Romanian counterpart, Emil 
Constantinescu, Interfax said Friday. He will also present his book 
``The Last Days of the U.S.S.R.'' at an international fair, it said. 
The book discusses the failed August 1991 coup against the last Soviet 
leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, and the collapse of the Soviet Union later 
that same year. Moldova was part of Romania before it was annexed 
by the Soviet Union in 1940.
