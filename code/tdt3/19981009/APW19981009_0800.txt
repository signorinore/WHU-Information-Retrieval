Lindsay Davenport, ending a months-long chase, finally claimed the 
No. 1 ranking in women's tennis Friday when Martina Hingis was beaten 
at the Porsche Grand Prix. Hingis, who needed to win to hold off the 
charging American in the computer rankings, lost a 3-6, 7-6 (7-4), 
6-4 quarterfinal struggle to Belgium's rising star, Dominique Van 
Roost. Davenport, the U.S. Open champion, will officially end the 
Swiss teenager's 80-week reign at the top in the new rankings to be 
released Monday. Hingis, slowed by a a taped ankle from a jogging 
injury suffered earlier in the week, battled back several times before 
Van Roost blasted a forehand down the line to end the two hour, 18 
minute battle. ``I had a lot of confidence out there. When you have 
nothing to lose and the other player has a lot to lose it's easier 
for you,'' said Van Roost. Van Roost, ranked 12th, constantly caught 
the 18-year-old Hingis flatfooted or moving in the wrong direction 
with her disguised strokes. Davenport would have taken away Hingis' 
top ranking, even if the Swiss teenager had won, if she beat France's 
Nathalie Tauziat in her quarterfinal match to be played later in the 
day. Hingis fought from behind the whole match against Van Roost, 
who blitzed Venus Williams in straight sets in her previous match. 
She trailed 1-4 in the final set, pulling even at 4-4 and then fought 
off two match points with hard serves before falling to Van Roost. 
``I think I played the best match of my life,'' said Van Roost, 25, 
who will break into the top 10 in next week's ranking. Spain's Arantxa 
Sanchez-Vicario, the fourth seed, became the first player to reach 
the semifinals after she rallied from 1-4 down in the second set to 
beat Lisa Raymond of the United States, 1-6, 7-5, 6-2. Raymond, ranked 
16th, dominated the Spaniard with hard strokes and by attacking the 
net until her forehand errors began mounting late in the match. Sanchez-Vicario 
completed her comeback by closing out the match in one hour, 57 minutes 
when Raymond double faulted. Hingis' top ranking had been in danger 
for months from the improved Davenport and her own slipping game. 
Last year, at this time, the Swiss player had a whopping 3,095 point 
lead over then No. 2 Jana Novotna in the computer rankings. But after 
winning three of the four Grand Slam tournaments last year and reaching 
the final of the fourth, the French Open, Hingis has only captured 
the Australian Open to open this season. Since then, she has won only 
three more titles while compiling a 54-10 record in singles. Once 
completely dominant, Hingis has been beaten three times this season 
by Davenport and once each by Venus Williams and Monica Seles.
