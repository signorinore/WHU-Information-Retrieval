Amid increased American pressure on on Serbia to end the Kosovo bloodshed, 
U.S. diplomats are also pushing for acceptance of a reworked political 
plan on giving Albanians there some self rule, sources said Friday. 
The U.S.-drafted reworked plan reportedly has been presented to both 
Serbian government and ethnic Albanian politicians in Kosovo but neither 
side has publicly reacted, said the sources, ethnic Albanians close 
to the negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The revised 
plan appears to have taken some Albanian demands into consideration, 
like stripping the Serbian and Yugoslav governments of any say over 
local Kosovo policy decisions. U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke was meeting 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for the fourth time in five 
days Friday to convince him to end the conflict or face NATO strikes. 
The sources said the draft would give the majority Albanian province 
of Serbia its own parliament and government, an acting president and 
an ombudsman _ presumably a foreigner _ in charge implementing the 
plan. Kosovo police, now Serbs in the tens of thousands, would be 
reduced to no more than 2,500 _ most of them Albanians _ and be headed 
by an ethnic Albanian with a Serb deputy. The reworked version of 
the plan gives the Serbian and Yugoslav government no say in the work 
of the local Kosovo authorities. Only international issues would be 
controlled by the federal government. Kosovo would also have its own 
judicial system. Army units would be deployed only at the borders 
of the province. It was not clear whether the two sides would agree 
to the plan. Milosevic rose to power a decade ago by revoking the 
province's autonomy, citing alleged harassment of Serbs by majority 
ethnic Albanians.
