For the first time, all five World Cup ski circuits will stage their 
finals at the same Alpine area _ Bormio and neighboring resorts _ 
in March 2000. The U.S. venue of Salt Lake City will host the finals 
of a possibly expanded World Cup program in 2004, the newly elected 
president of the International Ski Federation (FIS) announced Friday. 
Gianfranco Kasper said that the ``mini Olympics'' _ including Alpine, 
cross-country, Nordic combined, freestyle and snowboard _ will be 
held every four years when neither the Olympic Games nor World Championships 
are scheduled. The purpose is to draw attention of ski fans and boost 
television audiences. Salt Lake City will host the next winter Olympics 
in 2002. Vail and St. Anton will organize the World Championships 
in 1999 and 2001. Kasper said Salt Lake City organizers will rely 
on the Olympic infrastructures to host the World Cup finals in 2004. 
In March 2000, the encompassing World Cup finals will be held in Bormio, 
Santa Caterina, Livigno and St. Moritz. St. Moritz, which will host 
the Nordic combined, is in Swiss territory but less than 50 kilometers 
(30 miles) from Bormio, the Italian Alpine resort north of Milan. 
Santa Caterina and Livigno are within 25 kilometers (15 miles) from 
Bormio. Kasper, in Milan to attend a ski conference, said World Cup 
finals of biathlon and telemark may be added to the Bormio program. 
The tentative date for the 2000 finals is March 15-19, organizers 
said. Until now, the difference World Cup circuits all have organized 
their own finals. Bormio staged the World Alpine Championships in 
1985 and is the yearly site of a World Cup downhill.
