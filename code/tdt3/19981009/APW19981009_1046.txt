Commonwealth ministers called on member nations Friday to begin lifting 
sanctions against Nigeria as a reward for its promise to return to 
civilian rule next year. But Nigeria may not fully rejoin the Commonwealth, 
the 54-nation association of Britain and its former colonies, until 
the ministers are assured that Nigeria's Feb. 27 presidential elections 
succeed in creating a democratic government, said Commonwealth Secretary-General 
Emeka Anyaoku. Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth in 1995. 
``We want to give you encouragement to continue along the correct 
path you now have chosen,'' Anyaoku said to Ignatius Olisemeka, the 
foreign minister of Nigeria who attended the eight-nation meeting 
of Commonwealth ministers in London. Nigeria's new government, led 
by Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, has moved quickly to end the country's 
international pariah status. Abubakar came to power in early June 
following dictator Gen. Sani Abacha's sudden death by a heart attack. 
Abubakar has freed political prisoners, welcomed in foreign envoys, 
invited exiles to return and committed his military government to 
elections next year. In return, Abubakar has continually appealed 
for the international community to recognize the changes and lift 
economic sanctions. The U.S. has said it is willing to give military 
aid to Nigeria if Abubakar follows through on his pledge to hand over 
power after the election. Britain also has said that it expects the 
15-nation European Union, which imposed an arms sale ban, a sports 
boycott and blocks on some development aid in November 1995, to lift 
all embargoes soon, except on arms. Most of the sanctions against 
Nigeria were imposed after Abacha's regime hanged nine dissidents, 
including playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa. By calling for Commonwealth nations 
to begin lifting sanctions, the committee said they were ``recognizing 
the progress made by Nigeria so far.'' Olisemeka said he was pleased 
by the committee's recommendations and assured them, ``we know where 
we are now.'' The committee is made up of three of Nigeria's fellow 
African nations _ South Africa, Zimbabwe and Ghana _ as well as Britain, 
Canada, Malaysia, Jamaica and New Zealand.
