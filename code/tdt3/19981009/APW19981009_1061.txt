A military base in southern Italy is stepping up security for fear 
of Yugoslav retaliation for any NATO strikes, a newspaper reported 
Friday. Italy is just across the Adriatic from Yugoslavia; Italians 
have yet to say whether they would take part in a proposed NATO attack 
over Yugoslavia's treatment of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Italy's 
military has flown in warplanes from bases elsewhere in the country 
to boost its strength at the base at Bari, on the Adriatic Coast, 
Milan's Il Giornale daily reported. The military drew up defense plans 
for the base Thursday, the newspaper said. The base also is running 
drills to prepare for any enemy attack, Il Giornale said. ``These 
are the normal security procedures that are adopted in these cases,'' 
the paper quoted Col. Mirko Zuliani as saying.
