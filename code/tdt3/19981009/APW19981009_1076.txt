The United Nations is awaiting clarification from Chile on allegations 
that a top military officer working for a U.N. mission committed human 
rights abuses during the Pinochet dictatorship. Based on what the 
government says, the United Nations would decide whether or not to 
ask that Chile remove Brig. Gen. Sergio Espinoza Davies as chief of 
the U.N. Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan, spokesman 
Fred Eckhard said Friday. Human Rights Watch is urging his removal, 
saying in a letter to the U.N. chief that Espinoza's documented participation 
``in the worst human rights abuses in his home country'' renders him 
unfit to lead the U.N. group that patrols the tense Kashmir province. 
Espinoza, then a captain, was a member of at least one of Chile's 
notorious war councils, which issued a number of death sentences against 
leftists after Augusto Pinochet staged a military coup in 1973, Human 
Rights Watch said. Chile's National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation 
later found that judges on the tribunals had an unsatisfactory level 
of basic legal knowledge and concluded that many proceedings were 
used to justify otherwise illegal executions, the organization said. 
Espinoza on Friday refused to answer reporters' questions about the 
charges. ``I don't talk to the press,'' his secretary in Lahore, Pakistan, 
quoted Espinoza as saying. According to a report by the civilian government 
that succeeded Pinochet, 3,197 people were killed for political reasons 
after Pinochet came to power, including 1,102 who disappeared. Thousands 
more were tortured, forced into exile, or both. Pinochet relinquished 
most of his powers to a civilian government in 1990. He is still a 
senator. The United Nations has known about the Espinoza allegations 
for over a month, after the widow of socialist leader Freddy Taverna, 
executed on Oct. 30, 1973, sent Secretary-General Kofi Annan a copy 
of his death sentence. Jenny Arancibia said her husband was sentenced 
by a tribunal on which Espinoza was a member. Since then, the United 
Nations has repeatedly sought clarifications from Espinoza and Chile. 
Espinoza denied the charges and Chile hasn't provided a satisfactory 
official response, Eckhard said. The United Nations was waiting for 
such a response before taking any action. Several calls to the Chilean 
U.N. mission were not returned Friday. While stressing that he has 
no proof of the charges, Eckhard noted that the United Nations doesn't 
conduct background checks on people offered by member states to participate 
in missions. ``We don't second-guess governments,'' Eckhard said. 
``We expect governments to give us honorable, reputable people to 
serve in peacekeeping missions, and most of the time they do.'' While 
not defending Espinoza by name, the Chilean army on Friday re-released 
a communique defending the war councils on which he served. Criticism 
of Espinoza was aimed at ``damaging the image of the institution (the 
army) and of the officers in an unfair manner, since all they did 
was to carry on their duties,'' said the communique, dated Sept. 4 
after the first allegations began to surface. The councils, the communique 
said, worked in accordance with Chile's military justice code, which 
dates from 1925. Officers ordered to sit on the councils had to obey 
because ``that was a military obligation,'' it said.
