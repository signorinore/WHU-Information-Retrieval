BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO allies and Russia on Friday urged Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to end the violence in Kosovo, but Russia 
remained opposed to NATO's plan to try to end the crisis with air 
strikes. At a meeting of NATO ambassadors with Sergei Kisliak, the 
Russian envoy to the alliance, ``there remained a different perception 
on the use of force,'' said a NATO official, who spoke on condition 
of anonymity. The official said the allies and Russia agreed on ``the 
importance that (U.S. special envoy Richard) Holbrooke has gone back 
to Belgrade'' to continue his peace efforts. ``We need to give Holbrooke 
some time now.'' Holbrooke held new talks with Milosevic on Friday. 
Meanwhile, the NATO ambassadors were to meet through the weekend to 
finalize details of the planned air strikes against Serbia, including 
targeting and rules of engagement. They will also seek to find consensus 
on the ``legal basis'' for raids, an issue about which NATO officials 
expected agreement soon. The United States and Britain say NATO needs 
no authorization from the United Nations to launch air raids, but 
other European allies have doubts. If agreement is found, and Holbrookes' 
mission to Belgrade fails, NATO officials say the next step will be 
approval of an ``activation order'' which would authorize the allied 
military to launch an air strike within days. However, NATO officials 
acknowledged the political situation in two leading European allies 
- Germany and Italy, could delay that decision until next week. The 
Italian government collapsed Friday and Germany is negotiating to 
form a new government after last month's election. After a two-and-a-half 
hour meeting, the NATO ambassadors and their Russian colleague issued 
a joint-statement that expressed ``full support for the ongoing diplomatic 
efforts aimed at securing a political solution to the crisis ... and 
stressed the need to see immediate, full and irreversible compliance 
with U.N. Security Council resolutions.'' NATO officials said Russia 
agreed with the allies that Milosevic' compliance with U.N. demands 
to end the violence ``has not been enough.''
