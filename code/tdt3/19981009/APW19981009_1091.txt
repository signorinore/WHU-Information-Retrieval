American Andre Agassi and Britain's Tim Henman were the only seeded-players 
to book places in the semifinals of the dlrs 1 million Swiss Indoors, 
each posting solid wins in Friday's quarterfinals. Left untouched 
by the early round massacre, which saw world No. 1 Pete Sampras and 
world No. 2 Patrick Rafter crash out, fourth-seed Agassi marched through 
to the quarterfinals unhampered before trampling Sweden's Magnus Gustafsson 
6-3, 6-3. While sixth-seed Henman went to three sets in both opening 
rounds, the Briton needed just two sets to dispose of Nicolas Kiefer 
in the quarterfinals, defeating the German 6-3, 6-4. After a nine-minute 
first game, Agassi took control of his quarterfinal, breaking Gustafsson's 
second serve with a love game to go up 2-1. Then leading 5-3 with 
Gustafsson serving, the American broke again to clinch the set. Agassi 
continued his dominance in the second, breaking the Swede's opening 
serve. However, faced with a similar situation as in the first set, 
leading 15-40 at 5-2 on Gustaffson's serve, the American went on the 
squander three match points, giving the Swede the game. But the American, 
who reached the quarterfinals without dropping a set, refused to let 
a second opportunity slip by, closing the match on his next service 
game. ``Magnus is a really tough opponent,'' said Agassi, the winner 
of four tournaments this season. ``He's a veteran who knows how to 
play the big points. ``But my game has seen a lot of improvement and 
I'm feeling more and more confident. I'm more ready to step up and 
take control of the match.'' Agassi will face home favorite Marc Rosset 
in the semifinal, after the Swiss player won his semifinal match 6-3, 
7-6 (7-2) against German qualifier David Prinosil. ``The people in 
Switzerland are going to hate me if I beat three Swiss,'' joked Agassi, 
who defeated Swiss players Roger Federer and Ivo Heuberger in the 
first two rounds. ``But when Rosset is on, he's hard to beat. ``He's 
is a big guy with big serves, and he's not scared to take risks.'' 
Henman was similarly serving big and taking risks in his quarterfinal 
match against Kiefer. Leading 4-3 on Kiefer's serve, Henman broke 
then held to quickly take the first set. In the second set, the Briton 
again grabbed the advantage, breaking to take a 3-2 lead. Henman then 
simply held serve, sealing the match with a pair of aces, extending 
his winning streak to 10 consecutive wins. ``I have no complaints,'' 
said the 24-year-old Henman, who reached the top 10 in the ATP rankings 
this season for the first time in his career. ``I served extremely 
well and put pressure on my opponent, which was the key to the match.'' 
In Saturday's semifinals, Henman will meet Thomas Johansson of Sweden, 
who defeated France's Fabrice Santoro 6-3, 6-3 in his quarterfinal. 
Later in the day home-favorite Marc Rosset played German qualifier 
David Prinosil in the last quarterfinal.
