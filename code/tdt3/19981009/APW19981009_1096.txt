Germany's Sabine Bau won the women's foil title Friday at the world 
fencing championships, marking the first time in nine years that neither 
an Italian or Romanian has lifted the crown. Bau, runner-up at last 
year's worlds, defeated Russia's Svetlana Bojko 14-8 in the gold medal 
final, to become the fifth German woman in history to claim the title, 
and the first since Anja Fichtel-Mauritz won in 1990. Failing to defend 
her crown, two time world champion and Olympic gold medalist Giovanna 
Trillini of Italy was forced to settle for bronze, which she shared 
with compatriot Valentina Vezzali. Also a world champion in 1991 and 
Olympic titlist in 1992, it was widely expected that Trillini would 
be in the fight over gold with Vezzali. Instead the World Cup leader 
went out in the semifinals, after a narrow 15-13 loss to Bojko. Bau, 
silver medallist at the Seoul Olympics in 1988, defeated Vezzali 15-9 
in the semifinal to book her place in the gold-medal duel. Poland 
won the men's team foil title, defeating titlist France 45-40 in the 
gold-medal showdown. The Polish team, which included individual bronze 
medallist Piotr Kiepikowski, edged Cuba 4Qt-mk/FX|B?}iA{Rko#L{c)i

while South Korea bested Cuba for the bronze medal. Competition continues 
Saturday with the men's team sabre and teams epee finals.
