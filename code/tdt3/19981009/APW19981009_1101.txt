Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat warned Friday that the Middle East 
will be thrown into confusion if the peace process fails, and said 
that the success of next week's talks in Washington depends on Israel. 
``The most important thing is that if we do not do our best, all of 
us, to protect ... the peace process, then confusion will happen in 
the whole area of the Middle East,'' Arafat told reporters on a short 
visit to Helsinki. ``We have to wait and see how the Israelis will 
react to the American initiatives which have been declared and which 
we have accepted,'' he said. Arafat said he had the right to declare 
an independent state for the Palestinians next year but stopped short 
of saying he would do so. ``According to the (Mideast peace) agreement 
I have the right to declare the independence of a Palestinian state 
at the end of the five years of the interim agreement,'' Arafat said. 
``And, no doubt, on the fourth of next May '99 we have the right to 
declare our independent state,'' he added, but declined to comment 
further. Arafat arrived in Finland after talks with President Boris 
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov in Moscow, where he invited 
Russia to the U.S.-sponsored meeting next week as a co-sponsor of 
the Mideast peace process. Yeltsin said his government might be interested 
in participating in the talks, scheduled to open outside Washington 
on Oct. 15. But he said Russia first wants to know the views of Israel 
and the United States on the plan. Russia is officially a co-sponsor 
of the peace process launched by a conference in Madrid, Spain, in 
1991. But the United States has played a far greater role. Arafat 
declined to say whether Israel and the United States would welcome 
a more active Russian role, but he said he had also invited the European 
Union and ``Arab countries, including Egypt,'' to the talks. Reacting 
to the appointment of Ariel Sharon as the new Israeli foreign minister, 
who has been placed in charge of the negotiations with the Palestinians, 
he said, ``It's up to them (the Israelis).'' ``This is a pure interior 
Israeli affair. We don't interfere,'' Arafat said, adding that he 
would be prepared to shake hands with Sharon in Washington if the 
feeling was mutual. Arafat met with Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari 
before he left for Oslo, Norway.
