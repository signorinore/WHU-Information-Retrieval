Apartheid-era laws banning homosexual relations were struck down on 
Friday by South Africa's highest court, which ruled men convicted 
of sodomy since 1994 could demand monetary damages and have their 
criminal records cleared. The constitutional court's decision formalized 
guarantees granted in 1994, when white minority rule ended and a provisional 
constitution banned discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, 
race or gender. The National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality 
said Friday's ruling could open up adoption, marriage and other rights 
for homosexuals. ``The court has said that lesbians and gay men ... 
have a right to equality and dignity and privacy,'' said Zackie Achmat, 
the group's director. South Africa was the first country to ban discrimination 
on the basis of sexual orientation in its constitution. But the laws 
that criminalized sex between men remained on the books. Sex between 
women was never officially banned, but was symbolically stigmatized 
by the old laws, the court said. Under apartheid, sodomy could be 
punished with up to seven years in prison. Men were not even allowed 
to have casual contact at social gatherings that could be construed 
as homosexual behavior. The former South African military practiced 
so-called ``aversion therapy'' on gay men, applying electric shocks 
to victims while they viewed images of naked men, a report on human 
rights abuses said last year. ``Just as apartheid legislation rendered 
the lives of couples of different racial groups perpetually at risk, 
the sodomy offense (built) insecurity and vulnerability into the daily 
lives of gay men,'' the 11-judge panel said in its ruling. Panel-member 
Judge Albie Sachs wrote in the opinion that the ruling should be seen 
``as part of a growing acceptance of difference in an increasingly 
open and pluralistic South Africa.'' Since apartheid ended, President 
Nelson Mandela's government has pushed to end all forms of discrimination. 
The country's military protects the rights of gay and lesbian soldiers. 
Earlier this year, the police were ordered to include a lesbian partner 
under a female officer's medical insurance.
