Pakistani lawmakers on Friday gave the government sweeping powers 
to impose laws based on its interpretation of the Muslim holy book, 
the Koran, a giant step toward creating a new Islamic order. With 
opposition politicians chanting ``shame, shame,'' the National Assembly 
voted 151 to 16 to pass the constitutional amendment _ drawing widespread 
criticism from human rights groups and accusations of political power 
plays from the opposition. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had promised 
a new Islamic order for Pakistan, but some said the amendment was 
more an attempt to consolidate his power. He also was trying to defuse 
pressure from Islamic hard-liners that mounted after U.S.-led economic 
sanctions were imposed on Pakistan for its nuclear testing in May. 
``I congratulate the nation on the passage of the bill, which will 
help create a truly Islamic system,'' Sharif said after the vote. 
Under the amendment, the government would be ``obliged'' to enforce 
prayers five times a day and collect annual tithings. The amendment 
also says that it would override the ``constitution, any law or judgement 
of any court.'' The opposition, led by former Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto, has warned that the amendment could pave the way for a strict 
Islamic regime similar to that of neighboring Afghanistan, where the 
Taliban religious militia rule with an iron hand. Information Minister 
Mushahid Hussein, however, has said the government was a ``liberal 
Muslim'' government that opposed fundamentalism. Pakistan's army, 
which maintains behind-the-scenes influence on policy, has remained 
silent about the bill. But sources said the generals were unhappy 
because it concentrated more power in the government's hands and could 
fuel already rampant sectarian tensions. To become law, the amendment 
requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate _ something Sharif may 
have difficulty acquiring. While his ruling Pakistan Muslim League 
controls a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly, it does not 
have the Senate votes to pass the amendment. Some political analysts 
said Sharif may seek a vote in a joint session of the two houses, 
where he would likely be able to muster the required votes. It is 
unlikely Sharif could force a vote before next week. Human rights 
groups and women's activists have strongly condemned the amendment, 
warning that it would embolden militant members of rival Islamic sects 
and threaten the rights of women and minorities. Lawyer Asma Jehangir, 
a champion of Pakistan's minority religious groups, accused Sharif 
of pushing through the amendment ``for their limited power-hungry 
purposes'' and warned that it wronged Islam and threatened the country's 
fragile democracy. The opposition also said the amendment effectively 
supersedes Pakistan's constitution and the government could use it 
to overturn laws passed by Pakistan's four provincial governments. 
Sharif promised to protect the rights of Pakistan's minority religious 
groups, barely 5 percent of the country's 140 million people. ``Islam 
is a religion which has always recognized the rights of minorities,'' 
he said. The amendment includes a clause that protects ``personal 
law religious freedom, traditions or customs of non-Muslims and their 
status as citizens.'' But minority religious groups were unconvinced. 
``It is a weapon in the hands of fundamentalists, which would be misused 
against religious minorities,'' said Shahbaz Bhatti, a leader of the 
Christian Liberation Front, an advocacy group for minority Christians, 
who number about 2 million in Pakistan. Naveed Qamar, a spokesman 
for Ms. Bhutto's party in Parliament, said government ministers have 
already questioned the Islamic credentials of those who oppose the 
bill. ``We don't need any certificate to be a Muslim ... this bill 
is going to put you into total confusion,'' said Asfandyar Wali Khan, 
a member of the Awami National Party and a strong opponent of the 
amendment.
