"Headline News," I'm David Goodnow. One democrat called it the saddest 
vote he has ever cast. Thursday, the House of Representatives voted 
to begin a far-reaching impeachment inquiry of President Clinton. 
The vote came after more than three hours of sometimes bitter debate. 
In the end, the am inquiry was approved by a vote of 258 yes which 
included 31 democrats and 176 no, 175 democrats and one independent. 
Earlier, the house rejected an alternate plan by democrats, which 
would have limited the scope and duration of the inquiry. Both democrats 
and republicans made impassioned pleas during the debate. Closing 
our eyes to allegations of wrongdoing by voting no, or by limiting 
scope our time constitutes a breach of our responsibilities as members 
of this house. So let history judge us as having done our duty to 
uphold that sacred rule of law. If we don't apply that constitutional 
standard, hence, forth now and hereafter, impeachment will be a popularity 
contest. It won't be a constitutional contest, and we will be involved 
in an impeachment process for every single time regardless of whether 
this is a republican president or a democratic president because there 
will always be people out there who morally or politically think the 
president should be removed. Here is what happens next -- first, the 
investigation will begin immediately. The chief republican investigator, 
David schippers will determine the scope of the probe which can go 
beyond the limits of independent counsel Ken Starr's report. Hearings 
could begin shortly after the November elections and would have no 
formal deadline for completion. House Judiciary chairman Henry Hyde 
has said he hoped to wrap up the investigation by the end of the year. 
He says the house won't drag its feet. We're fighting the clock, as 
you know, because there's an election November 3rd. We don't believe 
we should do anything over it, that is to say, have hearings or anything. 
We don't want to be accused of politicizing this. But we will be doing 
a lot of planning and interviewing and whatever is necessary to get 
ready to have hearings after the election and try to get them completed 
as expeditiously as possible.
