President Clinton says he has surrendered to the process and will 
try to remain focused on his job and regaining the public's trust. 
John king has details. The president was in a sober mood after the 
historic vote, suggesting he's now little more than a bystander in 
the impeachment debate. It is not in my hands. It is in the hands 
of Congress and the people of this country. Ultimately, in the hands 
of God. There is nothing I can do. Mr. Clinton was in no mood to detail 
his strategy to say whether he would volunteer to testify, or challenge 
Monica Lewinsky's account of their relationship. Let me say again, 
on that, I will do what I can to help them ensure that this is constitutional, 
fair and timely. In the meantime, he vows not to be deterred from 
his work. Personally, I'm -- I am fine. Sticking to popular middle-class 
themes is a major element of the president's anti-impeachment strategy. 
We have got to pass a budget that protects the surplus and still will 
save social security, that keeps the American economy going. But the 
president is increasingly isolated, even from leaders of his own party. 
What the president did is wrong and he should be held accountable. 
The White House promises to cooperate with the inquiry, but won't 
back away from attacking the republicans running it. This is a situation 
and a process that's become injected with politics. Preparing an impeachment 
defense is a daunting challenge and the president is reaching out 
to old friends for advice. Participate in the process, testify, do 
whatever you have to do to follow the law. But get up every morning 
and do the business of being president. And you'll prevail. Hearings 
won't begin until after the November elections, time to plan, knowing 
all the while independent counsel Ken Starr will be watching closely. 
The president says his top priority is restoring the trust of the 
American people. But even many close allies wonder how effective, 
how persuasive a leader he can be, under the cloud of impeachment. 
John king, CNN, the White House.
