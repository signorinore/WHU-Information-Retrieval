U.S. district judge Susan Webber Wright will begin releasing evidence 
from Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit against President Clinton 
within two weeks. She says videotape of the president and of witnesses 
will remain under seal. Last month Mr. Clinton's attorney sent judge 
Wright a letter saying Monica Lewinsky's affidavit in the Jones case 
was misleading and not true. Jones' lawyers mentioned portions of 
the letter when they filed a motion against the president with the 
U.S. court of appeals. Earlier Thursday, New York developer abe hirschfeld 
agreed to pay Jones $1 million to settle her suit against President 
Clinton. That's the amount Jones initially wanted from the president.
