The centers for disease control and prevention says smoking rates 
among teens rose dramatically over the last decade. A study shows 
the number of adolescents who became daily smokers before they turned 
18 went up 73%. It says every day an average of 6,000 adolescents 
try their first cigarette. And, overall, at least 4.5 million kids 
aged 12 to 17 are smokers. Researchers are again recommending an increase 
in tobacco prices and limiting youngsters' access to them to combat 
the problem.
