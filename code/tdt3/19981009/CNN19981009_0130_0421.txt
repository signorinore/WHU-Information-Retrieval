President Clinton says, if they become necessary, initial NAto air 
strikes to end the bloodshed in the Kosovo region of Yugoslavia will 
send a very clear signal. Secretary of state Madeleine Albright is 
warning Yugoslavia it only has a few more days to stop the violence 
in Kosovo, before NATO orders the air strikes against Serb forces. 
Albright is sending U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke back to Belgrade 
in an attempt to persuade Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to 
comply with the international community. Albright says time is of 
the essence. It was very clear from all the people who spoke that 
we understood that time is running out. That the humanitarian situation, 
which we've all discussed, is not improving. That winter is coming 
on and that there has to be some action. U.S. officials say if NAto 
is called into action the American contribution would be limited to 
air power and no American ground troops would be used.
