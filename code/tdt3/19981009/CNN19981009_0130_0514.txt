With a look at your "Headline News weather," I'm Karen McGinnis. Temperatures 
will be quite mild across the central United States. Readings rebound 
into the 70s. Across the Canadian border states, look for temperatures 
in the 60s, but 50s can be found into the northeast and New England 
and much of the pacific northwest, in Alberta, Canada, and into British 
Columbia. Lots of 90s can be found in the desert southwest. It'll 
be unsettled for the next several days for the pacific northwest. 
Washington and Oregon will pick up some showers and some thunderstorms 
are possible. Finally, a frontal system makes its way mostly off the 
eastern seaboard. Still some lingering showers for sections of New 
York and into Maine. It'll be another round of breezy conditions across 
the Hawaiian islands and cooler in portions of the Caribbean. In the 
extended forecast, chillier temperatures can be expected into the 
northern Rockies. That continues for Sunday's forecast where plenty 
of rain and wind will occur going into the midwest by Monday and into 
the lower Mississippi river valley. For more weather information, 
you can log on to CNN.com.
