A genetic defect may be responsible for causing colon and lung cancer. 
Dr. Steve Salvatore reports. Yankee slugger Darryl Strawberry is fighting 
colon cancer. Former Orioles player and coach Cal Ripken Sr. Is battling 
lung cancer. Now, doctors believe they've uncovered a powerful new 
tool to fight the nation's number-two killer. We know it's involved 
in colon and lung cancer, and there's very strong suspicion that it's 
involved in breast cancer, cervical cancer, head and neck cancer, 
and maybe some others as well. Researchers at the University of Texas 
southwestern medical center at Dallas discovered a Gene that works 
to control the growth of cancer cells. Here's how it works -- the 
Gene produces a protein that removes phosphate from molecules that 
regulate cell growth, keeping the cells under control. When the Gene 
does not work properly, phosphate builds up, the cells divide out 
of control and develop into cancer. Now that scientists have discovered 
this Gene, and know how it works, they hope to use it to suppress 
tumor growth. If we can figure out how to stop that or how to remove 
those phosphates and get that balance back into normal levels, that 
should turn off the tumor. And researchers say it might be possible 
to test if someone's at risk within the next two to three years. If 
you identify a population at risk for death, it's much, much easier 
to get them to change their behavior. Both to never start smoking 
in the beginning, and to stop if they are smoking and have this high-risk 
Gene. Scientists are currently undertaking a massive effort called 
the human genome project to identify all 70,000-80,000 human genes 
in the next two to three years. Once that's done, they say all of 
the cancer genes will be identified. And that will lead to better 
treatments, prevention, and possibly even a cure. In the long run, 
it's very clear that we will discover how to cure cancer. It's a question 
of time and a question of complete understanding. This is a major 
step in that direction. Dr. Steve Salvatore, CNN, New York.
