The first American to orbit the earth is getting ready to return to 
space 36 years later. Senator John Glenn is back at Kennedy space 
center for his first flight rehearsal since February 1962. At 77, 
he will become the oldest person in space when the shuttle discovery 
blasts off on October 29th. Glenn will participate in medical experiments 
comparing the effects of aging with the effects of weightlessness.
