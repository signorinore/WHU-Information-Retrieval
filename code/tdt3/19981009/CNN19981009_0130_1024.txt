Regardless of what the stock market does, people will always head 
off to the elite business schools in the hopes of winning in the financial 
world. But which big name schools are worth going into debt for? Fred 
Katayama reports. To students at business schools, Wall Street is 
more than just a case study. Fall has seen the markets tumble. And 
like investors who buy bonds in a flight to quality, more students 
may flock to brand-name business schools than ever before. Tough times 
when there are corrections in either the marketplace or slowdown in 
the economy. This trend or flight to quality is likely to increase 
rather than decrease. And so getting into an elite school may become 
even tougher than before. "Business week's" top ten schools admit 
an average of just 12% of applicants. Wharton ranked number one, Kellogg 
moved up a notch to second. Chicago jumped from eighth to third. What 
we tend to see is that when things cool off, you think, "you know, 
I don't wanna be in the job market. It might make more sense for me 
to go, get my degree, get my training and in two years things might 
look a lot better. But the big names get bad grades on return on investment, 
considering the high tuition costs of roughly $25,000 a year. Schools 
offering the quickest paybacks -- University of Pittsburgh, Clark 
and South Carolina, where graduates take four years or less to get 
back the cost of tuition and foregone earnings. But some students 
wouldn't dream of anything but a prestigious University. You come 
to a top school, number one, senior executives in fortune 500 companies 
are heavily weighted with graduates of these top ten schools. So the 
alumni network is very strong. But those elite schools may limit admittance. 
Columbia's dean says the school doesn't want to feed too many MBAs 
into a declining economy, insuring applicants will have a tougher 
time getting in. Fred Katayama, "CNN Financial News," New York.
