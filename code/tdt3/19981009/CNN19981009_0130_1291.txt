The championship series was the Kevin brown show. While Tom glavine 
was uncharacterically waublging six in six-plus innings, brown went 
the distance allowing only three hits while striking out eleven. E 
also went 2-4 at the plate and scored in the 3-30 final. The padres 
head home for the next three games with a commanding 2-30 lead in 
the series zblit was a real moral victory to come in and play against 
this team and facing the pitching we were going to face. It speaks 
to the heart and soul of this team to come out and not be intimidated 
and not discouraged and to keep scrapping and fighting. I saw him 
pitch a no hitter on television and he had the stuff this night and 
his did that night.
