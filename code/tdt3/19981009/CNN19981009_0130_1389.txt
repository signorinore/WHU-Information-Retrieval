Dog, thinking: T-bone! T-bone! Looking for a T-bone! Chewy, meaty 
T-bone! At the big T-bone store! There's one! No, that's not one. 
Over there! no! no! On that shelf! ahh! Too green! Wait a minute! 
There! A whole package of little chewy, meaty T-bone steaks! Ya-hoo! 
I'm waking up! Mama brought you some T bonz dog snacks. Made with 
real meat, so dogs think... It's a T-bone! Resealable T bonz brand 
from Purina. It's a T-bone!
