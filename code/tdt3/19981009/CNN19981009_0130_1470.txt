A Boeing engineer is claiming a new world's record for keeping a paper 
airplane aloft. Ken blackburn of St. Louis kept his paper plane airborne 
for 27.6 seconds. The flight took place inside the Georgia dome in 
Atlanta. Blackburn needed four tries to beat the previous record of 
20.9 seconds, which was set in England. The record was serious business. 
Two timers were present to authenticate the feat.
