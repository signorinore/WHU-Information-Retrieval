Eddie Murphy goes shopping in his latest movie, spoofing the cable 
shopping networks in "holy man." Paul Vercammen reports. You want 
me to sell things for you on television? Eddie Murphy took on the 
role of "G", a spiritual guru in "holy man," and was drawn into the 
cult of home shopping. It's inescapable. If you live in this country, 
you know, it's everywhere. And I'm -- I'm a night owl. So I'm always 
seeing that stuff when you flip through the channels. Surprise! He's 
electrocuting Morgan Fairchild. You ever bought anything? no. I almost 
bought those knives, the ginsu knives, years ago. That looked like 
a good buy. I like music. Sometimes I see those record things, but 
I don't buy any of those things. Enter that dancin' machine, Jeff 
Goldblum, as a slick, custom suit-wearing TV huckster, who's fighting 
for Kelly Preston's love, his job and his sanity. But the futility 
of selling and -- and materialism. That's one of the ideas in this 
movie. It's about making people feel that they have to have it, when 
they don't really want it. Veteran Robert loggia plays the dastardly 
head of the shopping channel, and recalls another era of selling on 
the tube. Well think back to the days actually, when -- and the live 
television days, when the actor was called upon to sell cigarettes 
and coffee and all of that. I think it was quite demeaning to play 
a detective, say, in a series. And then come on and say, "and by the 
way, smoke camel cigarettes." Come on, talk about the ultimate huckstering. 
He's chain-sawing our happy time Redwood picnic table. Now Murphy 
had some options for other projects, and he chose "holy man" and thus 
no wardrobe changes. I got offered "rush hour" and "holy man," and 
it was like, I could go do "rush hour," run around California for 
12 weeks, and do karate with Jackie Chan, and get my ass whipped, 
or I could wear pajamas and be bald in Florida. "holy man." Look at 
this wonderland of things. Look at this. All for sale. But a moral 
here -- money can't buy happiness. It's not like we're preaching, 
but it's saying something. You know, stop wasting time. You're only 
on this planet for a little while, no matter who you are, you know, 
no matter what University you go to, no matter what circles you travel 
in. Amen, Eddie. Paul Vercammen, "CNN Entertainment News," Hollywood.
