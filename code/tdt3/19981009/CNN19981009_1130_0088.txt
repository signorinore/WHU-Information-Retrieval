Recent events in Washington have politicians from both parties planning 
their spin as they head into November elections. Candy Crowley takes 
a look. What will the constituents think? Wisconsin's Jay Johnson 
was explaining his vote to his district even before he cast it. Hello, 
this is congressman Jay Johnson with a statement on the impeachment 
inquiry of President Clinton. a freshman democrat with a mostly moderate 
record, Johnson won with 52% last time around. Now he fights for his 
career in his conservative, Catholic district. Johnson voted against 
the inquiry. "Conscience," he said, "not politics." Still, the politics 
are important enough for the congressman to begin reframing the answer. 
I voted for an impeachment inquiry. I voted for a limited impeachment 
inquiry with a time date. Voting for the democratic proposal, an inquiry 
with time clock, sounds so much better than voting against the republican 
plan. Connecticut's Jim Maloney, the most endangered of the endangered 
democrats, is another freshman with a moderate record -- 52% of the 
vote last time -- now in a toss-up race in a republican-leaning district. 
So after Maloney voted "yes" for the time-limited democratic proposal, 
he also voted "yes" for the republican open-ended one, too. I didn't 
look at this, and I don't think the American people look at this as 
something that should be decided on a partisan basis. This is a constitutional 
duty. Filling out the list of the top-five endangered democrats -- 
Lane Evans from Illinois. "Yea" to the republican-backed open-ended 
inquiry. Ohio's Ted Strickland, "nay." Iowa freshman Leonard Boswell, 
"yea." That was candy Crowley reporting. We apologize for the technical 
difficulties.
