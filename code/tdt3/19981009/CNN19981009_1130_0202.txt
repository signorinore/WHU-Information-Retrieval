Congress has until midnight to pass spending legislation to avoid 
a partial government shutdown. A temporary federal funding Bill runs 
out tonight. The new fiscal year began October 1st, but action is 
still needed on 8 of the 13 spending bills for the new year. The lawmakers 
are expected to pass another stopgap measure to keep federal agencies 
functioning for at least two more days. That will allow weekend negotiations 
with the Clinton administration over budget disputes.
