For John Glenn has climbed aboard a rocket ship for a rehearsal for 
the first time in 36 years. The flight is scheduled to happen in three 
weeks. For the first man who orbited the earth, worries about what 
can go wrong is nothing new. I'm scared I'm going to catch a cold 
an be replaced. I felt that way 36 years ago. We're ready to go three 
weeks from today. In about an hour from now, I guess it is, three 
weeks from today, that thing will light off back there. I'm really 
looking forward to this, as you can imagine. At 77, senator Glenn 
will become the oldest person ever in space. Some 83 experiments are 
planned for the nine-day mission.
