Four workers at a computer industry plant in central Washington state 
are in critical condition after an explosion and fire. Last night's 
blast released a cloud of potentially lethal silicon tetrachloride 
gas. Emergency officials ordered residents living within a mile of 
the plant to stay indoors. The company advanced silicon materials 
incorporated says no hazard to the community has been detected. Authorities 
blame the explosion on equipment failure.
