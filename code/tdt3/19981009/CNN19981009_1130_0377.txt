Take a couple of hundred kids, a thousand prize-filled balloons and 
pretty soon things are popping. But a promotional event at a New Jersey 
Wal-Mart store soon ballooned out of control when parents also went 
for the prizes. One woman who brought five children to the event says

minor injuries. One adult was hurt.
