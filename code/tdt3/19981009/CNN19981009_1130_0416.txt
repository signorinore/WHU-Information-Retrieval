I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "Headline News weather." It's 
going to be another cool day in the northwest and portions of the 
northeast, with 50 degree high temperatures in the forecast. A wedge 
of warmer air back through the plains, though, will push temperatures 
into the 70s and the 80s. Look for some 90s in the southwest. Forecast 
calling for more wet weather in the northeast both today and on into 
tomorrow, as lingering showers will remain in New England tomorrow. 
Showers will be moving out of the pacific northwest into the northern 
Rockies, where we'll even see some higher-elevation snows as cooler 
weather filters in through much of the southeast over the next several 
days. A look now at the extended forecast. On Sunday, rain and thunderstorms 
through the upper midwest back through the plains. Showers in the 
pacific northwest, and some lingering showers in the northeast. On 
Monday, cool temperatures filter in through the upper midwest. Rain 
will continue. Scatter thunderstorms will continue as well, back through 
the plains states. As temperatures warm up in portions of the west, 
on Tuesday we'll find a pretty good chance of showers in the pacific 
northwest and rain will continue from the Great Lakes and extending 
into the southeast. For more weather information, you can log in to
