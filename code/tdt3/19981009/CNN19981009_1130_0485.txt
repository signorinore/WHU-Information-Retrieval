Investigators are reportedly looking at the checklist used by the 
crew of Swissair flight 111. One step in the list might have sent 
power through damaged wires and then caused an electrical failure. 
Rob Gordon has an update on the investigation. These experts are working 
on a puzzle. A puzzle missing 90% of the pieces. What caused Swissair 
flight 111 to crash? Why did a routine flight go so wrong? No answers 
yet, but a few more clues. Faults recorded by the black box 0 seconds 
before they stopped recording. The sequence and type of data anomlys 
could provide potentially important clues about electrical components 
and power sources, and could later help us reconstruct the events 
that were happening within the aircraft. One of the first indications 
there was problem was when the autopilot shut down. And there's more. 
The TSB won't talk about it, but American ABC News says 11 minutes 
before the plane crashed, the pilot smelled smoke. The smoke got thicker, 
a few minutes later the lights were turned out in the passenger cabin. 
Six minutes later, flight 111 crashed into the sea off Peggy's cove. 
The TSB won't discuss the ABC story. They say it's protected information. 
Recovery work will begin again on the weekend when "the sea corercess" 
heavy lift barge arrives. That job could take weeks. Meanwhile, the 
province's medical examiner says he's identified the remains of the 
plane's pilots, stephan loew and captain urs zimmermann. Rob Gordon, 
in Halifax.
