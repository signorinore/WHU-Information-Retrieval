The FAA is considering ordering inspections and repairs on older versions 
of the most popular passenger plane in the world. The agency is concerned 
about the forward pressure bulkhead on Boeing 737s. A crack in the 
bulkhead could trigger the rapid depressurization of the aircraft. 
A final ruling is expected in early 1999.
