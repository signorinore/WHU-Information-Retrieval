Researchers say they've found the ruins of the oldest home site ever 
uncovered in western north America. The University of Oregon scientists 
discovered the remnants in central Oregon. What they found was a hearth 
and five posts that were originally part of a grass-covered, tepee-like 
structure. The site's believed to date back 10,000 years, 4,000 years 
older than previous finds.
