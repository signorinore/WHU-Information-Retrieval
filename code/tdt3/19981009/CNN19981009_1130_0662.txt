Many college students are doing more than just hitting the books -- 
they're hitting the bars and drinking until they're drunk, something 
called binge drinking. The first touch of independence, being away 
from home, being somewhere your parents aren't watching. And I guess 
it's a little bit exciting. Excessive drinking on college campuses 
remains a serious problem all across the country, according to researchers 
from the Harvard school of public health. Binge drinking can lead 
to serious health problems, and even death in some cases. A recent 
survey by the Harvard group found an increase in binge drinking on 
campuses. Among drinkers, drinking behavior intensified, so there 
was more drunkenness. There was some good news in the study. The number 
of students who don't drink any alcohol is on the rise, indicating 
some are getting the message about the dangers of drinking too much.
