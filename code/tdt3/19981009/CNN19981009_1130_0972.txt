Cautious investors steering stocks on a choppy course on Wall Street. 
Let's turn to Valerie Morris and get all the details. They're up, 
they're down. Now they're up again. Undecided investors are bouncing 
stocks around the markets. This in the wake of gains on most overseas 
stock markets with one main exception, Tokyo. On Wall Street today, 
the Dow Jones industrial average are revisiting the plus column that 
after sufrjing at the open and then retreating. We have a 1,000 point 
downside risk, we have a 7,000 upside potential over the next five 
years. Don't sell anything that's really a good name here, don't panic 
out. We still have some rough shredding ahead of us for the next several 
weeks.
