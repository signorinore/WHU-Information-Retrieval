Bid farewell to the American eagle. Bid hello to Georgia peaches and 
if beloved oak tree will adorn newly minted quarters next year. They're 
just two of five new images chosen by the first five states to ratify 
the U.S. constitution. Georgia chose the peach and Connecticut chose 
the depiction of an oak tree which hid the state's charter from the 
English in 1687. New Jersey's coin will feature the words, "crossroads 
of the revolution" while's Pennsylvania chose its motto -- "liberty, 
independence, virtue" and Delaware chose to honor revolutionary war 
figure, Caesar Rodney. Under a plan approved by Congress, all 50 states 
will redesign the tails side of the quarter. First father George Washington 
will stay on the top side.
