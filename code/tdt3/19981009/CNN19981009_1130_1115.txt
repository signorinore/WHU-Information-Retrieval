The Braves head to San Diego and it's uphill all the way. Sports is 
next. My dad always said: as soon as I get a computer you'll come 
out with something better. So, to make sure people like dad have the 
latest computer we invented Your:)Ware-- technology that grows with 
you. For just $49.95 a month you can buy a computer with an Intel 
Pentium II processor Internet access and in two years you can trade 
it in towards the purchase of a new one. What do you call this thing? 
Your:)Ware. Call 1-800-gateway and let's talk about your:)ware. Taz! 
taz! Looks like taz just got his AT&T phone Bill. Taz, don't you make 
a lot of calls on Sunday? Yes, taz call, taz call. Then use MCI five 
cent sundays. It's just five cents a minute. every Sunday. AT&T charges 
three times as much. Uh-oh. taz! Just call 1-800-sundays and become 
an MCI customer. Yeah!
