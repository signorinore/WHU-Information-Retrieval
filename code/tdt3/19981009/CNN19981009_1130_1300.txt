To baseball -- where the padres are two wins away from reaching the 
world series following last night's 3-0 win over Atlanta. Kevin brown 
held the Braves to only three hits while striking out 11 to give San 
Diego a 2-0 lead in the national league championship series. Attention 
Braves fans, no team has ever won a seven-game nlcs after dropping 
the first two games at home. I think I threw everything but the kitchen 
sink at 'em out there, so you know -- just winging it, just making 
stuff up as you go, really. The American league championship series 
continues tonight, with the Yankees and Cleveland even at one game 
apiece. Andy pettitte faces bartolo colon. I think we're pressing 
a little bit swinging the bats. I think if we lost the game in just 
the pedestrian, you know, with a home run and over and out, I'd have 
felt the same way. Mike Sammond, "Headline Sports."
