It looks like universal studios is headed back to the silent era, 
at least at night. A county commission has asked the studio to keep 
it down while filming scenes before dawn with explosions, shootouts 
and helicopters. The noise restriction was recommended while the commission 
was considering universal's plans for a massive explosion on its 415-acre 
site overlooking the San Fernando valley. If approved, universal will 
become the first southern California studio with noise restrictions.
