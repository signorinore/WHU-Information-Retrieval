If you're looking for ideas on how to design the perfect haven, you 
may want to consider one designer's hideaway that boasts a turn-of-the-century 
flair. Elsa Klensch takes a look. a place where time stands still 
for New York interior designer Stephen shadley coming to his weekend 
catskills country home is like taking a trip into the past. His 13-room, 
queen Anne-style brick house was built in 1891. It's situated on property 
with a 200-year-old stone bridge and a rich history to go along with 
it. The land once belonged to the mohican Indians, then transferred 
to early Dutch settlers in the 1600s. Shadley says he was especially 
attracted by the lush and peaceful natural surroundings. The view 
from that Porch, when you look at the Creek and the bridge is just 
stunning. You have the catskills mountains in the distance looking 
west, so you can sit on the Porch and watch the sunset over the catskills 
mountains. It's lovely. You built your own garden? I had no idea what 
I was doing. I started planting trees 'cause I knew that was important 
initially, and then I planted shrubs, and I finally got around to 
gardens, and slowly sort of developed a plan for the property. The 
front Porch door creates the look of an entrance, but it's actually 
an illusion. It's one of these houses where you really can't enter 
from the front door. I think carriages used to bring you to that. 
And now, of course, we have to kind of come in the back door. Shadley's 
love of history shines through in the entrance, particularly along 
the staircase. I had always been fascinated by Indian or early American 
and native American sort of culture. I've got photographs, postcards, 
pictures of trees everywhere, but it just sort of symbolized the area 
for me, because that's what this was. It was an Indian land originally. 
Shadley says he believes in preserving the authenticity of the turn 
of the century. So he fills his living/dining area with victorian, 
American empire, and arts and crafts pieces of furniture. Mattress 
ticking is a theme for the master bedroom. The iron bed is from the 
1800s. Somehow was okay to put in an American house. The chest of 
drawers is a victorian era furniture. How would you describe the house 
in one word? A fairy tale, like some place that never really existed, 
maybe it only existed in your mind, but to some degree, I have been 
able to sort of make it happen, in my life. That's Steven chadley, 
Elsa Klensch.
