"Headline News," I'm Sachi Koto in for Chuck Roberts. Those stories 
in a moment, but, first -- the Washington scramble to finish writing 
the federal budget is in full swing. Congress was supposed to have 
finished the job October 1st. A temporary spending measure has kept 
the government open since then, but it expires tonight at midnight. 
Congress and the White House are blaming each other for the stalled 
negotiations. This budget is purely and simply a test of whether, 
after nine months of doing nothing we are going to do the right thing 
about our children's future. Members of Congress should not go home 
until they pass a budget that will strengthen our public schools for 
the 21st century. Congress is expected to approve legislation to keep 
federal agencies open for at least two more days. Once the temporary 
spending measure is passed, lawmakers must settle scores of spats 
of remaining spending bills for fiscal 1999, which began October 1st.
