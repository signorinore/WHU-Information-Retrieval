The house has passed legislation that would make it tougher for the 
overextended to erase their debts. President Clinton is threatening 
to veto the proposed changes in bankruptcy law. Opponents say they 
would plunge financially strapped families into debt for the rest 
of their lives, while coddling credit card companies. Supporters say 
the changes will clamp down on bankruptcy abuse. Personal bankruptcy 
filings have jumped 300% since 1980.
