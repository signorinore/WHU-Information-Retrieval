Tensions in the Kosovo province of Yugoslavia remain high as NAto 
prepares to take military action within a matter of days. Relief organizations 
have pulled their staffs out of Kosovo in the event of NATO strikes 
and retaliation for them. The alliance is ready to use force if Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic doesn't comply with U.N. demands to end 
violence against ethnic Albanians. Brent Sadler has more. Back to 
Belgrade. United States envoy Richard Holbrooke pushing hard to find 
a peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis, talks which are set to have 
a decisive outcome. But it's unclear how many hours or days he'll 
keep on trying. A countdown to possible NATO military action is in 
place. There's been no change in the situation since I saw you last. 
It remains extremely serious. NATO continues in intensifying, planning 
and preparation for action. And we're continuing in intensifying diplomatic 
effort to see if that is going to be necessary or not. This will almost 
certainly be the final phase of diplomatic efforts to reach a peaceful 
solution. U.S. officials are under no illusion as to the difficulty 
of the task they are facing. The Yugoslav and Serb authorities are 
showing no sign of buckling under pressure, insisting that military 
operations in Kosovo are over and that refugees are safe to return 
home. But the west rejects those assertions and demands immediate 
action to break the deadlock. A six-point plan formulated by a big 
power contact group has been handed to President Milosevic. It includes 
-- an end to all violence from both sides in Kosovo. The withdrawal 
of Serbian security forces and heavy weapons. And the safe return 
of refugees coupled with a start to negotiations on self rule for 
Kosovo's ethnic-Albanian majority. President Milosevic shows every 
willingness to continue talks, but, so far, gives no indication he's 
about to take undertake the international community's key demands.
