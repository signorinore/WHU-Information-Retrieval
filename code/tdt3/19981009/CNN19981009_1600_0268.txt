Members of the house Judiciary committee say they might ask Monica 
Lewinsky, Linda Tripp and Vernon Jordan to testify at the impeachment 
inquiry of President Clinton. The house voted yesterday to authorize 
the probe. Committee chairman Henry Hyde says the hearings will begin 
after the November elections. He says it is not likely the president 
will be asked to testify. White House officials say lawyers from both 
sides are meeting next week to discuss details of the inquiry. Well, 
we've begun a dialogue with the committee, but we haven't reached 
the point of negotiations. What we want to do is make sure we establish 
a process that's fair, that's expeditious, that's nonpartisan, that's 
constitutional. And then we will see where that process takes us. 
The White House engaged in a very active campaign to convince democrats 
that they shouldn't vote for the resolution. And I think that had 
some impact. But I think it's significant that 31 members on the democratic 
side of the aisle understood that our resolution needed to go forward. 
It's also very important to understand that there was a virtual unanimous 
agreement that the House of Representatives has an obligation to review 
these matters. Even the democratic alternative recognized the president's 
conduct requires our further review.
