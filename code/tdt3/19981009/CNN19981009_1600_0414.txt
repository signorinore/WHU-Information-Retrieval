36 years after he first went into space, John Glenn is about to go 
into orbit once again. The 77-year-old senator from Ohio and his six 
crew mates aboard shuttle "discovery" conducted a full dress rehearsal 
today, ending with an emergency evacuation of the spacecraft. Glenn 
says some things haven't changed since 1962. Back then, I was scared 
to death I might get a cold or something like that and might be replaced. 
I feel the same way right now. We're ready to go just three weeks 
from today. And three weeks from today and about an hour from now 
that thing will light off back there. And I'm really looking forward 
to this, as you can imagine. "Discovery" is scheduled to launch October 
29th.
