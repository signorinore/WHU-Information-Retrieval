Palestinians are criticizing the appointment of ariel Sharon as the 
new Israeli foreign minister. The former general is considered a hard-liner 
in the negotiations over withdrawal from the West Bank. Prime minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu made the announcement only days before he meets 
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Washington. There has been 
renewed violence in recent weeks. An Israeli soldier was stabbed to 
death today, and 32 Palestinians were injured by Israeli troops.
