Italian prime Minster Romano Prodi resigned today after his center-left 
government lost a confidence motion by one vote. It's the first time 
an Italian government has fallen on a confidence vote. Typically, 
a prime minister resigns rather than face that test. The Italian president 
has asked Prodi to stay on as a caretaker until a new government is 
formed.
