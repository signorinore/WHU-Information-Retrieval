This look at your "Headline News weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for Saturday morning. Really a nice day is expected on 
Saturday throughout much of the U.S. we will still see rainfall lingering 
in the New England states and stretching southward along the front 
down across the Florida peninsula. But much of the rest of the country 
will be in good shape. Nice cool temperatures throughout much of the 
nation, although it does begin to warm up a little bit in the plains 
states as you can see. 80s will find their way through Texas, Oklahoma, 
as far north as Kansas. And the southwest continues to be quite warm. 
We move ahead now and take a look at our extended forecast. On Sunday, 
look for rain showers associated with a weather system coming in through 
the northwest to move in through the northern plains states along 
with some cooler temperatures. As we move ahead to Monday, the work 
week begins with rainfall filling most of the Mississippi river valley. 
And as you head on into Tuesday, the cold weather associated with 
that system moves through the Great Lakes area, into the New England 
states, and the rainfall continues to slide on to the east through 
the Ohio valley. And the northwestern corner of the United States 
sees a new cold front approach. For more weather information, log 
onto CNN.com. four-day forecasts for 6,100 cities.
