Coast guard investigators are employing high-tech methods to track 
down leaky oil tankers. Lab tests, satellite imagery and shipping 
logs led authorities to a liberian tanker this week. The coast guard 
says the tanker is responsible for two spills off the California coast 
last month. The owner of the vessel could face civil and criminal 
penalties. A formal investigation is under way.
