"Dollars & Sense." And still ahead, your heirlooms may be worth more 
than you think. A popular road show separates the junk from the treasures. 
Good afternoon, heaven. My daughter's marrying a musician. I'll transfer 
you. Heaven. I'm on fire! Oh, I'll put you right through. Heaven. 
I need a 1,000 digital color copies, A.S.A.P. oh, sorry. Need a copying

telecommunications boundaries that separate local from long distance... 
voice from data... domestic from global. And force you to accept separate 
carriers separate networks, a blizzard of bills. Ah, but there is 
a way through those barriers. Right through here. The port of entry 
to a seamless global network that lets you have one carrier one contact, 
one Bill. And makes it seem as though the old boundaries no longer 
exist. Because for you, they won't. On-net. From MCI Worldcom.
