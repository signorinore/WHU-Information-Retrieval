The University of Pennsylvania's Wharton school took first place in 
a new list of best schools to receive a graduate business degree. 
The biannual survey by "business week" magazine sent questionnaires 
to about 9,600 graduating MBAs at 61 schools and 350 companies that 
actively recruit. This was Wharton's third straight time at the top. 
Northwestern University's Kellogg school of management placed second. 
Rounding out the top five -- the University of Chicago, the University 
of Michigan and Harvard.
