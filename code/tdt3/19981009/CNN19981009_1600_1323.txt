In college football, Marcus Ray will miss two more games for violating 
NCAA rules. This kid obviously, his career here at Michigan, has been 
impacted by a man who knowingly violated the rules. This experience 
has humbled me. I now realize that I have to use good judgment at 
all times. My use of poor judgment allowed me to be taken advantage 
of, and as a result, I lost some precious games from my senior season.
