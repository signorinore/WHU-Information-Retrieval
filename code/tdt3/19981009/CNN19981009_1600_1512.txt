Dust off your family heirlooms. "The antiques road show" is traveling 
across the country to appraise your personal belongings. It may turn 
out what you consider junk is someone else's treasure. Gloria Hillard 
reports. They've arrived, thousands of them. A population of a small 
town looking a bit like refuges with their meager belongings, bags 
and suitcases. But at a closer look and they've brought -- It's a 
blow dart gun. Malachite. These are the figures from Oz -- dorothy, 
the straw man, tin man. A lamp from my grandmother. Mickey -- he's 
been in the family as long as I can remember. And she's hoping it's 
worth a small fortune. Welcome to the touring "antiques road show." 
It's become hit on PBS. I purchased a trunk of linens, and inside 
that trunk I found -- Boy, did you make a lucky find. I think there's 
a lot of human drama on the show. That's why we watch it. It's where 
you can learn that what you've found at the yard sale -- I've had 
her for about 20 years. -- might be worth a treasure. It sort of has 
that lottery also, you know? You never know what you might have. This 
was a mother-in-law gift. Hopefully, it will turn out to be something 
relatively worthy. This woman is hoping her painting is a picasso. 
The frame says "original." I don't know anything about it. I've had 
it for a couple of years. So after waiting hours in line, this is 
the first stop -- I would take that over to glass, please. Have a 
vase and pitcher. With your treasure and a ticket, you hit the appraisers' 
table. Somewhere between $75 and $100. Maybe $500 to $700 for the 
bracelet. Somebody had told us that they had bought it over in England 
and that it was turn of the century. Turns out it's value is decorative, 
or it's a fake. This little boy paid a dollar for a cookie jar at 
a yard sale. Well, you've got a good eye. It's worth $100. So you've 
got the bug now, huh? Yeah. And this vase that this man kept in the 
hallway is worth $25,000. So, time to bring out my stuff -- Okay. 
Okay, and so this guy here -- Well, I have a matching one. You have 
a matching one? Sure. My matching pigs, my chicken tea cup and that 
old green bottle I dug up, altogether, $45 dollars. Now, you'd think 
the pigs would be worth more than that. Gloria Hillard, CNN Entertainment 
News, Los Angeles.
