"Headline News." I'm kimberley Kennedy, in for Lynne Russell. The 
federal government has a few more days to try to work out a new budget. 
President Clinton has just signed the temporary spending Bill approved 
by Congress. It would provide funding to government agencies through 
Monday. That gives lawmakers more time to hammer out the complete 
annual budget. A temporary measure that has kept the government running 
since the first of the month expires at midnight. Democrats are pointing 
fingers at republicans for the delays. The republican-controlled house 
has passed only 6 of the 13 spending measures for the new fiscal year. 
Republicans say the White House has bogged down negotiations by proposing 
new spending projects. President Clinton says Congress should not 
shortchange important priorities like education. Politics should stop 
at the classroom door. It is not too late. We are here not simply 
to state our strong conviction and our willingness, the willingness 
of these people who have to run to defer their campaigns to take care 
of our children's future, but to invite our republican colleagues 
to join us and finally try to salvage some shred of positive accomplishment 
for the American people. I hope they'll do it. There is still time. 
We're disappointed right now that the president has put us on the 
defense. And has set up so many expensive government programs that 
he is willing to spend the surplus on while denying us the right to 
spend it on tax relief. So during these hours, we are going to be 
preparing for next year. We feel a very strong support from our conference 
to plan, for example, to keep our commitment to seniors by preserving 
and protecting social security. Republican leaders say they hope to 
get the budget passed by Sunday. Democratic leaders say that's not 
likely.
