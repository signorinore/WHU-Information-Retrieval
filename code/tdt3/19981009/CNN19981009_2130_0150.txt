Members of the house Judiciary committee say they might call Monica 
Lewinsky, Linda Tripp and Vernon Jordan in for questioning. The U.S. 
House of Representatives voted yesterday for an open-ended impeachment 
inquiry. The Judiciary committee will conduct the investigation. The 
chairman of that committee says it's unlikely President Clinton would 
be subpoenaed to testify. A democratic leader in the house says yesterday's 
vote was difficult. We must understand the consequences of our vote, 
and a "no" vote on the Hyde resolution yesterday meant that the process 
came to an end, the democratic proposal had been defeated. The republican 
proposal was the only one on the board, and a vote "no" there cuts 
all of this process off. I wasn't comfortable with that. The options 
are censure, impeachment, resignation. None of those options are very 
good. My preference was a censure.
