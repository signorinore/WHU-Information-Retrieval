The president is giving the nation's top police officers credit for 
helping achieve the lowest crime rate in 25 years. Mr. Clinton announced 
new funding to hire more police and reach 90% of his goal to put 100,000 
additional officers on the streets. The president also attacked a 
GOP proposal that he says would weaken the system of background checks 
for gun buyers established by the Brady law.
