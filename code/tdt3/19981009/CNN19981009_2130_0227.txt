U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke is trying one last time to persuade Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to pull back in Kosovo and avoid a NATO 
military attack. Holbrooke and Milosevic had two meetings today in 
Belgrade. The state department described those talks as "tough going." 
Serbian forces have been attacking a separatist movement by ethnic 
Albanians in the province. If the Serbs don't pull back, NATO could 
strike within days. We believe the next step is that the allies, the 
NATO allies, must approve the action order. And what herr Schroeder 
says is that he expects that to happen on Monday. He has talked with 
chancellor Kohl. They have talked back and forth together about this. 
What do you say about the prospects of German/American relations with 
the new government? I feel very good about it. The state department 
says the situation on the ground in Kosovo appears to be quiet today, 
but there's no sign Yugoslav troops have met the demand to pull back.
