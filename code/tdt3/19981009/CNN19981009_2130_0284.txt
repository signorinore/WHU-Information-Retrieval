Ethnic Albanians aren't the only people who want to see an end to 
the conflict. More on that from Richard Blystone. Something in the 
air casts the gravest kind of doubt on the Kosovo liberation army 
cease-fire that was supposed to begin on Friday. Darinka and planinka 
were gathering carrots when Friday's first burst of shooting came. 
Now, along with bugs, weeds and worms it's bullets in the garden. 
"I'm still shaking, she says. The shots come from their own ancestral 
fields and Woods, beyond the dike, across a little river. Where the 
Serbs of priluzje no longer dare to farm. Here, there's more to worry 
about than the prospect of NATO air strikes. Like other enclaves of 
Kosovo's ethnic Serb minority, this one, surrounded by ethnic Albanians, 
is preoccupied with survival. This spring the mayor drew the defense 
line at the dike, manned nightly by men with hunting rifles. "Things 
were okay with the Albanians until this year," he says, "but now there 
is no way we can go on." "Only this week," the mayor says, "the owner 
of this jacket paid for daring to take his cows across the dike and 
fish in the river." Men in camouflage came down and shot him as he 
fled." "We don't attack anybody," he says. "We just defend ourselves". 
And the mayor would like to know why the rest of the world doesn't 
understand the desperation of the Serbs. The Serbs whole identity 
is rooted in Kosovo. In orthodox Churches and monasteries like De'chani 
at the far end of the province, seven centuries in the lap of Albania's 
mountains. Land christened with blood, defeat by the Ottoman empire 
here in 1389, kindled both dream of a Serbian state. And a folk history, 
of a beleaguered people battling to survive. Last century Serbs were 
said to make up four-fifths of Kosovo's population then around 50 
years ago the balance tipped, and Serbs became a shrinking minority 
in the land where their history began. Now they are outnumbered by 
an estimated nine to one, and that is not the end of it. Everyone 
here says Kosovo must be forever Serbia. But for now, says this man, 
the Serbian border is here. Richard Blystone, CNN, priluzje, Yugoslavia.
