Senator John Glenn and the rest of the crew of the shuttle "discovery" 
rehearsed their launch today at the Kennedy space center in Florida. 
Today's practice run ended with three seconds remaining on the countdown 
clocks. The crew then practiced an emergency evacuation. 36 years 
ago, Glenn became the first American to orbit earth. "Discovery" is 
scheduled to lift off October 29th.
