Researchers at New York University are using a revolutionary technique 
they say will help infertile women become pregnant. They combine an 
egg from an infertile woman with one donated by a fertile woman. The 
resulting egg is then fertilized and implanted into the infertile 
woman. The scientists say they have tried the technique on two women 
in their 40s. The first attempt failed. The second woman is expected 
to take a pregnancy test next week.
