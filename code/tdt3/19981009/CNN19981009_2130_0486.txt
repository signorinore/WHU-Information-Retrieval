This look at your "Headline News weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for Saturday morning. Rainfall will continue in association 
with a frontal boundary just hanging right along the east coast. We 
could find a few rain showers continuing in the New England states 
and a few showers, possible thunderstorms, will scatter across the 
Florida peninsula. But most of the rest of the nation will be dry. 
There is another frontal system that'll reach through the upper midwest 
back into the far west. But no rainfall at all associated with it. 
Behind it, there is an area of precipitation moving through the northern 
Rockies. And in the overnight hours, chilly enough we could see some 
snowfall associated with it. But all in all, a nice autumn weekend 
on tap for most everyone. Cooler temperatures in the northwest as 
that frontal system moves through. The plains states heating up a 
bit again, but almost everyone else will be very comfortable. Here 
is your extended forecast. On Sunday, rain showers in the northern 
plains states and the southern section of that area of precipitation. 
We could see a few thunderstorms. We move on into the beginning of 
the next work week, rainfall will fill the Mississippi river valley. 
And as we head on into Tuesday, you can see rainfall moving eastward 
into the Ohio valley. For more weather information, log on to CNN.com.
