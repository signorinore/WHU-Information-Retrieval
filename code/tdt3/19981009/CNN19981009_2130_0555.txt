The appointment of ariel Sharon as the new Israeli foreign minister 
is drawing criticism from Palestinians. The former general is considered 
a hard-liner in the negotiations over the West Bank. Prime minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu made the announcement only days before meetings 
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Washington. There has been 
renewed violence on the West Bank. An Israeli soldier was stabbed 
to death today, and 32 Palestinians were injured in a confrontation 
with Israeli troops.
