Wal-Mart has issued an apology for an in-store promotion in which 
dozens of people were hurt. A store in brick, New Jersey, dropped 
balloons stuffed with prize coupons from the ceiling. Nearly 50 people 
were injured in the scramble for the balloons, some as young as 2 
years old. In the words of a Wal-Mart spokesman, "it's safe to say 
we won't do anything like this again."
