With the help of new technology and your computer, you can man the 
helm with sailors traveling around the world. Marsha Walton has more 
in "tech trends." 16 sailors are racing 27,000 miles across the globe 
in the grueling around alone competition. It means for us there are 
no nights and no days, mostly we are working all the time, but we 
usually sleep by periods of one hour, and when it is really difficult, 
twenty minutes. But these racers are not really alone anymore. Technology 
adds a new level of connection, for the sailors, and for millions 
discovering the sport on the Internet. Well, now with the technology 
we can be in touch, through E-mail, through satellite phone. We can 
send pictures, we can send video. So now people can participate in 
the sport, they can see us. The downside is we have no privacy anymore. 
So this is another way of looking at the real boats. Quokka sports 
is presenting the race on the around alone web site. It's rainy, it's 
Gray its overcast some squalls are coming through. The raw material 
comes from the skippers themselves, who transmit E-mails, audio clips 
and digital pictures of their voyage. Golf and tennis transformed 
in the '50s and '60s as a result of TV. For sailing that's what we're 
seeing now. It's become a global spectator event. Registered virtual 
sailors can set their own courses, and compare their progress with 
the racers and other cybersailors. But they will miss out on some 
experiences. When you like sailing, being outside, alone on the ocean, 
with the sky and the sea and the birds, you feel you are at your place. 
Skippers should hit the finish line back at Charleston sometime next 
may. Marsha Walton, CNN, Charleston, South Carolina.
