It may be a little bit country, but it's also becoming a popular convention 
city. Nashville gets a look from Lori Waffenschmidt in this edition 
of "working ahead." Known as music city, USA -- Nashville is rich 
with melodic history. Nothing whispers to me For decades, tourists 
have trekked to the birthplace of country music. I go out walkin' 
after midnight But these days, the journey is being made by would-be 
crooners and conventioneers alike. Well we're probably one of the 
top 10, 12 convention cities in the country. That has brought a new 
visitor here. One thing that makes the city attractive is its central 
location. Geographically, we are positioned so that you can drive 
or fly very easily. An hour or two, you can reach 0% of the population. 
Nashville is also home to the opryland hotel -- now the world'S-largest 
hotel and convention center. 2,800 rooms surround three huge atriums, 
featuring everything from Delta boat rides to replicas of New Orleans 
streets. We get about 4 million visitors a year. And we host over 
2,000 conventions a year. And they come from the fortune 500 and all 
the major associations. All dancin' to the jailhouse rock Another 
reason for the city's success goes right back to its entertainment 
roots. There's that sizzle that goes with entertainment cities. And 
Nashville is fortunate enough to be one of 'em. You think, "we're 
going to have a good time." So attendance is always high. And when 
attendance is good, that's good for the association or the corporation. 
And that's good for a city expanding its tourism reach. Lori Waffenschmidt, 
CNN.
