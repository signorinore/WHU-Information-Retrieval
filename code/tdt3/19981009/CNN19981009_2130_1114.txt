The yanks and the Indians are back in business tonight. "Headline 
Sports" is next. No, it's not a keyhole. I'm not looking through the 
doorway at someone. I'm looking through the on-net port. Port of entry 
to a seamless global network. A network that will change the fortunes 
of countless companies and the lives of thousands of Telecom managers 
and CIOs. I see them out there, right now. They seem... rather happy. 
On-net. From MCI Worldcom.
