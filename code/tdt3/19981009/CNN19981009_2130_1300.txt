The national league championship series resumes on Saturday with the 
padres taking a 2-0 series lead into game three against Greg Maddux. 
The way we played in Atlanta, boy it really makes you feel good because 
Atlanta is not an easy place to play. And when you're facing their 
pitching staff and win two in a row and there you are and then you 
get to come home. Yeah, that's a good feeling. That makes you feel 
really good, but we still got a lot of work to do.
