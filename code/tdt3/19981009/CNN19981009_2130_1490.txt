Hollywood has always walked a difficult line when it comes to sexual 
material on television. Now with Monica Lewinsky and the current news 
cycle, the dilemma is more obvious than ever. Jill Brooke reports. 
What do you think mom and Diego are doing on their date? I don't know. 
Think their doing sex? It is the type of question most families dread. 
And as the show "Jesse" reveals, it causes both discomfort and unease. 
But it is a question which is being asked more often. Just tease yourself 
a little. For years, it was easy to blame Hollywood, because many 
shows have steamy dialogue, ranging from "Ally McBeal" to "the practice" 
to "Howard Stern." But when Congress released Clinton's sexually charged 
testimony, many in Hollywood felt it smacked of hypocrisy. It seems 
like a very odd time to be doing that when news programming is exempt 
and you've just played four hours of Clinton testimony on every single 
network, which is far more graphic and unrated than anything that 
you'll ever see on network television. And many complained not as 
Hollywood stars, but as parents. You know it's ridiculous. Do I want 
my kids listening to all this stuff? no. Anything that's on TV when 
a child is in the room is, in effect, children's programming. But 
the media research center, a longtime critic of Hollywood, does not 
find Congress' action hypocritical. The Congress received the report, 
the public has a right to know. It's a huge difference between that, 
and having the entertainment industry for a gratuitous purposes, and 
gratuitous purposes only, promote sex. While the debate continues, 
parents are feeling more and more helpless. Sure, there's ratings 
for TV content, warning labels for CDs and kid-friendly networks like 
nickelodeon. But many don't think it's enough. According to "USA today" 
-- 75% of the parents polled said they tried to monitor programming 
on television, on the Internet and in music. But almost the same number 
also said that limiting exposure to popular culture is nearly impossible. 
But this goal may no longer seem like a hopeless cause. Innocence, 
which comes from the Latin root "not harming," is always reattainable. 
Perhaps people are feeling enough is enough. But, as many say, the 
best way to create a change is for the public to cast their vote both 
at the ballot box and with their Nielsen box. Jill Brooke, "CNN Entertainment 
News," New York.
