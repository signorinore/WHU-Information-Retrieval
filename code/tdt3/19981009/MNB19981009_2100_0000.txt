The day after the vote, the president on the attack while America 
is getting -- getting used to the idea of weeks, perhaps even months 
of hearings. A parade of witnesses and more damage to this presidency. 
Tonight a close look at the Clinton administration. They are leafing 
the man and the administration that brought them to Washington and 
racking up legal bills just because they worked in the White House. 
And tonight meet the 9-year-old who goes to college next year. His 
parents just want him to grow up right.
