And now to the hill on this night after the day the house voted to 
hold impeachment hearings. No budget agreement yet, threats of a shutdown, 
insults flying and most members just want to fly out of town to run 
for re-election and keep the jobs they now have. With more on that, 
NBC news correspondent Gwen Ifill. The day after the big vote, Congress 
racing against a midnight deadline to finish the rest of its business, 
including frantic, last-minute negotiations to pass tax cuts, ban 
assisted suicide, and even extend the duck hunting season in Mississippi. 
We will stay as long as it takes to finish our business In the house, 
lawmakers approved a bankruptcy Bill to make it tougher for consumers 
to erase bad debts but the president will veto it. This law could 
put you into debt for the rest of your life. And democrats staged 
one last aattempt to salvage a political lost cause, H.M.O. reform 
but the impeachment echoed especially for Jay Dickey of the president's 
home state of Arkansas. He voted for the for a democratic plan that 
would limit it. I think after a while people are going to start saying 
why didn't I do that? The unorthodox vote apparently didn't cost him 
at home. As for the Judiciary committee, which will hold the impeachment 
hearings, members shall devicing a wish list of potential witnesses 
but not just yet. After tying up loose ends this weekend, lawmakers 
leave town to campaign for re-election. Gwen Ifill, NBC news, the 
capitol.
