Time now to look at the weather forecast across the nation. We go 
to WNBC television in New York and meteorologist Janice huff. Hi, 
Brian. Most of the nation is dry tonight. But across the northeast, 
an area of low pressure continues to spin and spin, and heavy rain 
now across parts of eastern Pennsylvania and over New England. Down 
to block island, long island, two to three inches of rain. Temperatures 
in the 50's right now in Seattle, 62 at lake Tahoe. Earlier today, 
were you at 20 degrees this morning, it was very chilly there. 40's 
across the heartland and parts of the midwest, Ohio valley. South 
Florida into the 80's tomorrow. 70's from North Carolina over towards 
St. Louis. 70's and 80's for most of California. Los Angeles, 74 high 
tomorrow. Phoenix, 94. A few showers in Seattle. Boston, another rainy 
day. The jet stream tomorrow will allow more cool air to build across 
the Rockies. Snow in the higher elevations. Cool air in the northeast 
by Monday. Thunderstorms across Florida Monday. Windy and warm across 
southern California. That's the weather around the nation. Thanks.
