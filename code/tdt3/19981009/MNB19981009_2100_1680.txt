Some much younger trainees half a continent away have been forced 
into an unusual way of improving performance in the swimming pool. 
Mark Davies who coaches a team of 10-year-old girls in darwin, Australia, 
puts a real, live crocodile in the pool with them. The girls swim 
frantically to keep from being eaten by the baby croc. The coach says 
it's working but says lap times have come way down.
