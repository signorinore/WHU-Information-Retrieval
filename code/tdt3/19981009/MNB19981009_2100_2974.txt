When we come backage a look at tomorrow's headlines theefplgt and 
this -- I'm reading books such as nicolo machiavelli's "prince," Dante's 
"Divine comedy," and bocaccio's "the decameron." That is not the voice 
of an adult college professor. He is 9 years old. A look at a young 
man's extraordinary life so far. "Are you talking to me?" Introducing 
your:)ware technology that grows with you. When you cl 1-800-gateway 
we can custom-build you a portable desktop with an Intel Pentium II 
processor and a dvd drive for movies. All for just $87 a month. And 
in two years you can trade it in toward the purchase of a new one. 
: I love this part. : me too. Call us, and let's talk about your:)ware 
from gateway. - this cold. - My throat. It's so sore. - You gave me 
this cold. - You gave it to me. - You gave it to me. - You gave it 
to me. You guys-- enough. We gotta keep movin' here. I'm takin' dayquil. 
Takin' what? - You know. Nyquil for night-- - and dayquil for day. 
I'm takin' these. That won't touch your cough or headache. - We'll 
see. - like the complete relief of nyquil? - You'll love non-drowsy 
dayquil. - You guys are doin' great. Let's take a look at the front 
pages. Late news from tonight for Saturday morning's paper in Washington. 
There has been a continuing resolution signed by the president. There 
will be no shutdown. But this is for now. It's temporary, supplies 
enough money to run the government for three days. Back at it next 
week. A poll of Washington's secretaries finds the sympathy vote is 
with Betty Currie because of what she went through to protect her 
boss. "Denver post," a nasty hate crime -- University of Wyoming, 
openly gay student found near death. Two men arresteded and charged 
with attempted murder. Two women as aaccomplices. And "Chicago tribune" 
-- Sharon has been named foreign minister for Israel. A war hero, 
deep distrust for the Arabs. Still held to his refusal to shake the 
hand of Yasser Arafat. Hardly a dove in the Middle East tonight.
