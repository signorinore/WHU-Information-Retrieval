Good evening. It's been a week of impeachment votes, volatile financial 
markets, and now, to add to the tension of the times, Kosovo. American 
warplanes could eventually be sent to the area, if NAto air strikes 
are ordered against Yugoslavia for refusing to back off in Kosovo 
-- the tiny province where ethnic Albanians have been slaughtered 
as a punishment for their demands for independence. As American diplomatic 
efforts continue in Yugoslavia through the 11th hour, President Clinton 
today was lining up additional support from Germany's chancellor-elect, 
Gerhard Schroeder. He supports NATO action if Yugoslavia doesn't back 
off.
