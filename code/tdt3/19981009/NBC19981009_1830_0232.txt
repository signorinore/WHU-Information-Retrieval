American ground forces are already on duty as peacekeepers in nearby 
Bosnia, well past the one-year commitment President Clinton originally 
promised. So now, if there's additional military action, how does 
it play out? NBC's Jim Miklaszewski tonight at the Pentagon. Well, 
Tom, over the next several days, the U.S. and NAto will turn up the 
pressure to try to convince Milosevic the military threat is real 
and that it would be severe. So over this weekend, expect to see the 
U.S. send six B-52 bombers from their base in Louisiana to preposition 
in England. In the first wave of air strikes, the B-52's would be 
used to launch cruise missiles to take out Serb air defenses. So far, 
no orders for U.S. warships now in the Mediterranean. But they are 
armed with cruise missiles and could move within firing range with 
a 24-hour notice. It now looks like NATO could issue the activation 
order, authorizing the use of force on Monday. Air strikes could come 
anytime after that, but probably not immediately. One final chance, 
Milosevic, to back down. Thankses very much. Jim Miklaszewski at the 
Pentagon.
