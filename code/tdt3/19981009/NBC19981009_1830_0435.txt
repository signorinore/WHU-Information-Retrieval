In Washington tonight -- the night after the spectacle that was the 
debate and vote to open an impeachment inquiry against President Clinton. 
Things were looking a lot more like the normal scene for early October. 
Meaning -- there's no budget agreement, both parties are hurling insults 
at each other, and everyone's scrambling to get out of town. We have 
two reports tonight, on where the president stands and the budget 
battle. We'll begin at the White House with NBC's Claire Shipman. 
Claire? At midnight the government is thee O retically out of cash. 
The two sides are still horse trading for a final deal. Flanked by 
more than a dozen democrats, the president lectured republicans, after 
they handed him the most serious defeat of his political career yesterday. 
He insists republicans give him the money he wants for education. 
They have tried to erode my commitment to saving social security first 
in the House of Representatives. But still not too late for us to 
go forward together on our children's future. Politics should not 
stop at the classroom door. Republicans think they will win on tax 
breaks for farmers and the way the next census will be counted. The 
money the P president has been demanding for the international monetary 
fund will likely be approved. But republicans intend to insist on 
conditions for how the IMF makes loans. Meanwhile, the presidnet's 
lawyers plan to meet with republicans next week to discuss the mechanics 
of the impeachment hearings. Perhaps the trickiest legal issue the 
White House is weighing, whether it can reach prior agreement with 
Congress that the president testified falsely in the Paula Jones suit 
without admitting he committed perjury. Claire Shipman, NBC, the White 
House.
