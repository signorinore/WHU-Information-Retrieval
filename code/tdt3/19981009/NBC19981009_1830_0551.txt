This is Gwen Ifill on Capitol Hill. The day after an historic impeachment 
vote. Congress, racing against a midnight deadline to finish the rest 
of its business, including frantic last minute negotiations to pass 
tax cuts, ban assisted suicide and even extend the duck hunting season 
in Mississippi. We will stay until as long as it takes to finish our 
business. In the house, lawmakers approved a bankruptcy Bill to make 
it tougher for consumers to erase bad debts. But the president says 
it favors credit card companies, and will veto it. This Bill, if enacted 
into law, could put you into debt for the rest of your life. And democrats 
staged one last attempt to salvage a political lost cause -- HMO reform. 
HMO before we go! But the impeachment vote echoed especially for republican 
Jay Dickey of Arkansas. The only member of his party to anger republican 
leaders by voting for a democratic plan to limit the impeachment inquiry. 
But Dickey also voted for the open-ended republican resolution. I 
think after a while, people are gonna start sitting, thinking. Well, 
why didn't I do that? Dickey's unorthodox vote apparently did not 
cost him at home. A lot of other republicans should've had the guts 
to be that objective and do that. Members of the Judiciary committee 
are devicing a wish list of potential witnesses, but not just yet. 
After tying up loose ends this weekend, lawmakers leave town to run 
for re-election, turning from deciding the president's future, to 
assuring their own. Gwen Ifill, NBC news, the capitol.
