When we come back -- NBC news "in depth." Wall Street's wild week, 
are the boom times about to go bust? It's the truck. And it's here. 
Introducing the new Silverado. It's bigger. It's more powerful. It's 
the truck from Chevrolet. Like a rock oh, like a rocka bagel for breakfast. 
What could be better? Well, you could do a lot better with total. 
Just one bowl of total... gives you 100% of the iron you need every 
day. A bagel, only 20%. Total has 100% of 10 essential vitamins and 
minerals. Compared to that, a bagel is a little flat. So get 100% 
with total, total raisin bran, total corn flakes. What are you getting 
for breakfast? Put more cash into your kids' school. Clip box tops 
for education logos... from general mills products.
