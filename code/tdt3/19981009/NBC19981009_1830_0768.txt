NBC news "in depth." Wall Street, reeling from a global economy in 
crisis. Your money. After getting hammered all week long, today, investors 
apparently decided to scoop up some bargains from the wreckage of 
the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average rose almost 168 
points. The NASDAQ climbed more than 73 points. For the week, the 
Dow was up almost 115 points. But NASDAQ couldn't recover from huge 
losses all week long and ended the week, down more than 122 points. 
So what happens now? For some insight, we turn once again to CNBC's 
Ron Insana. Tom, it's been one of the wildest weeks ever on Wall Street 
with stock, bonds and the value of the dollar suffering big swings 
day to day. Unless the federal reserve comes to the rescue quickly 
with even lower interest rates, many investors believe in the worst 
case scenario, the Dow could fall to the low 6000s and the economy 
could well slide into recession. Just look at the recent damage on 
Wall Street -- half of the stocks on the New York exchange, down almost 
33% from their highs. And half of the stocks on the NASDAQ are down 
a stunning 58%. The plunk in the market the last couple of months 
is really the U.S. market catching up with the rest of the world on 
the down side and investors beginning to worry about foreign economic 
issues having an impact on the u.s. And the impact is reaching from 
Wall Street to main street. Big layoffs, expected at the major investment 
firms. Thousands of jobs will be cut and major American companies, 
Gillette, Hewlett Packard, Raytheon, laying off thousands more. Indeed, 
America's business leaders say it could very well get worse. In a 
survey, 95% of them say global economic problems will hurt their companies. 
Today's rebound in stocks was encouraging but if another hot spot 
emerges in the global economy, then the weeks ahead could get ahead.
