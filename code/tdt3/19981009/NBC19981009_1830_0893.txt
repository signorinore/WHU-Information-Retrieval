The economic turmoil has already shaken America's economy but it could 
get a lot worse if Brazil suffers a knock out punch. Why does that 
mean so much to this country? We continue with NBC Mike Jensen. The 
largest economy in Latin America, the United States' biggest south-American 
trading partner, on the brink. If Brazil goes, it could be the straw 
that breaks the camel's back. Brazil is nearly bankrupt. Thanks partly 
to a massive drop in coffee and soybean prices, Brazil's two big cash 
crops traded on exchanges like this to help prop up its economy. Brazil 
has already borrowed a quarter of a trillion dollars, and now it doesn't 
have the money to pay interest on the loans. Why should Americans 
care? Because more than 2,000 U.S. companies sell $16 billion worth 
of goods in Brazil. And that translates into more than 200,000 jobs 
for American workers in the U.S. if Brazil fails, analysts say there 
will be a horrendous ripple effect, engulfing already weakened Venezuela, 
as well as Argentina, Chile and Mexico. That's because Brazil is the 
powerhouse of Latin America, accounting for nearly half of all of 
the region's economic activity. Now, with foreign investors bailing 
out of Brazil, world economic leaders, who met in Washington this 
week, may put up $30 billion in emergency loans. There is a way out 
of the crisis. But first, Brazil, which is running a huge deficit, 
must balance its budget. The government will probably be forced to 
take a series of strong measures, concerning cuts in public expenditure 
and increases in taxation. Raise taxes and cut spending? Tough steps 
in a country where 30 million people live in poverty. Difficult problems 
for Brazil's newly reelected president, who has already taken small 
steps to reform the economy, and has only weeks to come up with much 
broader reforms. Much at stake not only for 164 million brazilians, 
but for the United States and the world. Mike Jensen, NBC news, New 
York.
