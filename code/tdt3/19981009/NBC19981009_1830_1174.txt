We have an update about Hugh Finn, the man that was battling the governor 
of Virginia over her desire to remove the feeding tube that was keeping 
her husband alive. The tube was removed eight days ago and today he 
died. They went to have an emergency order to have that feeding tube 
put back, but the appeal was denied.
