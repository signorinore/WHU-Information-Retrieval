In laramie, Wyoming, four people are in jail and a young gay man is 
in a deep Ko Mo near death from a savage beating. This is on hate 
and the law and the feat of Matthew sheperd. It was an gruesome discovery 
at this fence, late Wednesday afternoon as the sun was setting, two 
bicyclists approached and, at first, they said it looked like a scarecrow 
had been tied to the fence. Instead, a lifeless, savagely beaten body 
of a a 21-year-old Matthew sheperd, a University of Wyoming freshmen, 
a gay man, barely alive tonight, in a coma, brain damaged on life 
support. Today, two young men, Russell Henderson and Erin McKinney, 
who whispered obscenities as he came into the court, were charged 
-- kidnapping, robbery and attempted murder. A hate crime, according 
to police who say that the two met sheperd in this laramie bar and 
tricked him into believing they were gay, too. The three left together. 
It was 1:00 A.M. but sheperd, a small man, was allegedly beaten with 
a butt of pistol, burned and finally tied -- spread eagle -- to the 
fence where he was left to die. Wyoming, the cowboy state, is one 
of eight without a hate crime law. For the last five years, the legislature 
here has defeated attempts to get tough on those who hate. They said 
they didn't want to give preferential treatment to homosexuals. Across 
the country, hate crimes, based on race, religion and sexual orientation, 
are rising -- 8,759 incidences, according to the latest FBI statistics. 
Its is another story off of campus. A small town signaled out a person 
who is different from the rest. It is bound to happen sometime. At 
wild Willey's cowboy bar today, patrons say hate is easy to find. 
If you come to Wyoming and you are gay, you are looking for trouble. 
Two women have also been arrested in this case, an 18-year-old juvenile. 
This is sheperd's friend, Kathleen burn. We are probably never going 
to speak to him again. Tonight as he clings to life, people here only 
know him as a victim of hate and on a lonely fence outside of town.
