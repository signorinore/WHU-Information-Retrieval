Kids, if you're watching this next story with your parents, you may 
want to leave the room or get them to. In the department of measuring 
up, this is a tough standard. If you're 9 years old, you're probably 
in the fourth or fifth grade. If you're 9, and Greg Smith of Jacksonville, 
Florida, you're picking out colleges. Jessica jallings of wtlv, Jacksonville, 
Florida. [ . Do you want to come over and tell us a story? Imagine, 
this is your 1-year-old child. You ask him to recite his ABCs. What 
comes after "H"? i. What comes after "O"? What comes after "O"? By 
2, he's telling you about the books he's reading. What is the second 
one? This is the jurassic period. This is cretaceous period. Same 
child today at age 9. I am reading machiavellis' "prince," Dante's 
"Divine comedy" and "the decameron." From philosophy to chemistry, 
it seems. There's nothing Greg Smith does not want to know. I'm also 
interested in colonial architecture. 19th century architecture and 
20th century architects like gaudi. Greg still amazes his parents, 
Janet, a former actress, and Bob, a microbiologist. I knew Greg would 
become very smart at some point, much smarter than I am. But I never 
dreamed at six that I would not be able to help him. What is it that 
she has regained? What has she regained? She's regained her identity, 
her self-worth and her respect. By the time he was 8, Greg was in 
high school. Now, a senior, he's a top candidate for valedictorian. 
Greg's goals are clear -- to maintain his perfect grade point average 
so he can get to college by the age of 10, his top two choices, Duke 
and Swarthmore, and after that? I want to be an aeronautical engineer. 
I want to be a biochemical research doctor. Hopefully to be our ambassador 
to the United Nations. I want to be president of the United States. 
Why do you think you have this special gift? Well, that's something 
that I don't know, and I probably won't know. But all I have to say 
is that I will work to my ability and to use it to the best of mankind.
