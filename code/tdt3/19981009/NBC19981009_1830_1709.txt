That is "Nightly News" for this Friday. Now, here is a look at two 
of the stories that we will be bringing you on Monday. A blizzard 
of mailings to homeowners. They look like checks but they are loans 
on your house. Interest rates are high. The penalties can be disastrous. 
If you can't make the payments, you are going to lose your home. It 
is a staggering business. Be careful. And trying to start a family. 
Science takes a big step. Great promise for a new fertility treatment. 
Far better chances of having a baby. Much lower risks of multiple 
births. I'm Tom Brokaw. I'll see you on Monday.
