Menashe Zemro, the last remaining ques, or traditional spiritual leader 
of Ethiopian Jews, died Wednesday in Qiryat Gat, the town where he 
settled after arriving in Israel in 1991. He was 92. His funeral Thursday 
in Qiryat Gat, in southern Israel, attracted thousands of mourners, 
but Israeli television reported that no representatives of the Orthodox 
rabbinate, Israel's governing religious body, were present. By the 
rabbinate's ruling, Ques Menashe and other Ethiopian Jewish leaders 
were not authorized to officiate at ceremonies like weddings and funerals, 
as they had done in Ethiopia, and were indeed not to be called rabbis. 
Pointedly ignoring this caution, Addisu Masala, a member of Parliament 
of Ethiopian origin who spoke at the funeral, called Ques Menashe 
``the chief rabbi of the Ethiopian Jewish community in both Ethiopia 
and Israel.'' Despite the rabbinate's ruling, until shortly before 
his death Ques Menashe counseled the steady stream of Ethiopian Jews 
who accepted his authority and sought his wisdom in his ground floor 
apartment and adjoining chapel. Shoshana Ben-Dor, an anthropologist 
in Jerusalem and the director in Israel for the North American Conference 
on Ethiopian Jewry, said Ques Menashe was ``very unhappy that the 
traditional forms of Judaism that he had practiced were not being 
accepted by Israel authorities and were being allowed to disappear.`` 
Ques Menashe never learned to speak Hebrew, but in his native Amharic 
and in other languages of Ethiopia, he would caution his followers 
to bear the trials of immigration with patience and tolerance. Such 
cautions were not always heeded: A little more than a year after his 
arrival, 16 Ethiopian Jews were arrested as they rushed into the prime 
minister's office to demand that the rabbinate treat Ques Menashe 
and his colleagues no differently than other rabbis. Ms. Ben-Dor said 
that the leader was vigorous for his age and that his most striking 
physical quality were ``eyes that were incredibly mischievous.'' She 
said it was likely he had come to adulthood without awareness of the 
scale, scope and history of Jewish life in Europe or America. Masala 
said Ques Menashe was survived by several children and grandchildren. 
Ethiopia's Jews, known as Falasha or Beta Israel, traced their origins 
to Solomonic times but had long been separated from other Jews. Their 
communities had the Torah but never acquired the Talmud or the medieval 
commentaries that shaped modern Judaism, and conducted their rites 
in Geez, a Semitic language that is also used in Christian liturgy. 
Graenum Berger, 90, of New Rochelle, N.Y., who began a campaign more 
than 30 years ago to help rebuild the Falasha community, said that 
in addition to conducting rites, a ques is responsible for memorizing 
the genealogy of his congregation, going back as far as 10 generations, 
and maintaining prohibitions on marriage with non-Jews. Ms. Ben-Dor 
said that each region where Jews lived in Ethiopia had a chief ques, 
and that Ques Menashe had held this position in Semien and Wogera, 
north of Gondar, the historical heartland of Ethiopian Jews. She said 
that as many as 20 percent of the 45,000 Jews who have settled in 
Israel since 1974 originated in this region, but with the deaths of 
two other regional leaders, many from beyond the area looked to Ques 
Menashe as a leader. The title of ques is gained through learning. 
Ques Menashe came to Israel as part of the last wave of Ethiopian 
Jewish emigration. Israel arranged for most of the migrants to be 
airlifted out, and in the 15 years before his arrival, much of the 
migration had been carried out in secret. Ms. Ben-Dor said that while 
other figures of similar religious rank had come from Ethiopia earlier, 
their arrival could not be publicized. There are now about 70 Ethiopian 
Jewish spiritual leaders in Israel, The Associated Press reported, 
but they are elderly and no longer possess even the local authority 
they had in Ethiopia. There are younger Ethiopian Jews who are pursuing 
Orthodox rabbinical studies. ``A person like him doesn't exist anymore,'' 
said Masala, the legislator. ``It looks like he was the last.``
