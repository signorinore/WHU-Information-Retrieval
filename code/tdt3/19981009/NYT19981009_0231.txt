Peter de Jager enjoys kidding about his unlikely emergence as the 
Paul Revere for the year-2000 computer crisis. ``I'm not very good 
on dates,'' de Jager says with a laugh, explaining how he cannot recall 
when he bought his aging Ford Explorer or how long he has lived in 
his modest split-level home in this Toronto suburb. ``Antoinette,'' 
he calls to his wife. ``When did we move here?'' But it has been a 
long time, since de Jager, a former computer programmer, has joked 
about how computers handle dates. His voice was not the first to warn 
that the world was sitting on a computer time bomb that could explode 
at the dawn of 2000. But it was an essay he wrote five years ago titled 
``Doomsday 2000'' for the trade magazine Computerworld that is widely 
regarded as the information-age equivalent of the midnight ride of 
Paul Revere, as the alarm that stirred the industry into taking the 
year-2000 menace seriously. ``We and our computers were supposed to 
make life easier; this was our promise,'' de Jager wrote. ``What we 
have delivered is a catastrophe.'' The problem, of course, is that 
many computers and software programs recognize years by only their 
last two digits _ and, with the shift of centuries, they may identify 
``00'' as 1900 or not recognize it at all. The resulting miscalculations 
and malfunctions could disrupt banking, telephones and virtually any 
other service industry. Since then, de Jager has become something 
of a folk hero in his crusade to publicize the problem. He figures 
that he averages more than five interviews a day, and his goal this 
year was to cut back his commitments so he could at least be home 
on weekends. ``It's lonely on the road,'' said de Jager, the father 
of two teen-age sons. He said he could not shake his regret at missing 
the funerals of his brother in 1996 and his father this year. ``I'm 
as close to burnout as you can get without seeing charred edges,'' 
he said. There are benefits, of course. De Jager, 43, earned a six-figure 
income last year for the first time. Having bumped his standard speaking 
fee to $7,000 from $4,000, he stands to do even better this year. 
De Jager, who had moved up from his programming duties to jobs in 
systems management and giving speeches on managing technology before 
encountering year-2000 fame, acknowledges that his new status also 
has its rewards. He has lectured the world's central bankers in Basel, 
Switzerland, on the perils of inaction, rubbed shoulders with powerful 
chief executives at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, 
and gained access to leading politicians in Washington and other capitals. 
His name is on the stock index of software companies that make much 
of their money from year-2000 business, and his three-year-old Web 
site (year2000.com) is a focal point of news and discussion about 
the problem. ``It's an adventure I'll be able to talk to my grandchildren 
about,'' he said. And yet, in an age when getting rich _ the faster 
the better _ seems to be the operating principle in most businesses, 
de Jager is leading the modest life style of someone who expects celebrity 
to be fleeting. His nondescript three-bedroom ranch home, chosen for 
its proximity to the Toronto airport, sits deep in a crowded subdivision. 
He bought a similar house across the street to use as an office. The 
de Jagers recently bought a vacation getaway _ not a beachfront mansion 
in Miami but rather a 77-acre farm that is a 45-minute drive from 
home. De Jager is no longer surprised by insinuations that he is trying 
to cash in on his fame _ but he continues to be upset by them. ``I 
don't own a single share of any year-2000 stock,'' he said, referring 
to software and consulting companies that deal with the problem. ``In 
seven years of speaking, I've never mentioned a vendor from the stage, 
and I could easily have made a million dollars by endorsing something.'' 
A large, bearded man who seems to draw energy from a podium, de Jager 
made public speaking a full-time job in 1993 after discovering a talent 
for boiling things down to simple metaphors and pithy pronouncements. 
``He's a contrarian by nature, and he's garrulous,'' said Dennis Eskow, 
a journalist in 1989 when he first met de Jager, then the head of 
information technology at a Canadian clothing company. ``With a slightly 
different sensibility, he could be a stand-up comic.'' Lately, de 
Jager has been annoying many former allies by chastising audiences 
for moving ``straight from denial to defeatism.'' He has been predicting 
that the year-2000 bug will turn out to be disruptive but not necessarily 
disastrous. Businesses and governments can avert an electronic Armageddon, 
he preaches, if they will press ahead with efforts to upgrade computers 
and figure out contingency plans. Sometimes you can get by with ``steppingstones 
instead of a bridge,'' he has been saying. De Jager was born in South 
Africa, but his family moved among that country, his mother's native 
Ireland and Canada before settling in Canada in 1971. All that ``made 
me someone very cognizant of change and what goes into problem-solving,'' 
he said. So how does de Jager plan to spend New Year's Eve 1999? He 
has received a stream of invitations to events large and small that 
would either celebrate the industry's victory over the year-2000 threat 
or wallow in its defeat. But he says he intends to be sitting with 
his family at O'Connor's, a popular pub for Irish musicians in Doolin, 
County Clare, where his mother lives, slaking his thirst and playing 
the bodhran, a goatskin drum. ``I'm not very musical, but I can keep 
time,'' he said.
