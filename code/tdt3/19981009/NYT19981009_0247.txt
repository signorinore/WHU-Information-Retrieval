Can anyone save Save Venice? A schism among the leadership of the 
glittery international charity of that name has become the talk of 
the black-tie party circuit, from Park Avenue to the Grand Canal. 
At a heated meeting last month at the Hotel Monaco in Venice, the 
board of Save Venice, which includes some of the most prominent people 
in New York society, split into warring camps. Though the members 
have partied, traveled and raised money together for years, one side 
ultimately stalked out. Now it looks as though there will be no more 
fabulous visits to the home of Countess Cristiana Brandolini d'Abba, 
a sister of Gianni Agnelli, nor to other private Italian palazzi, 
which had been thrown open to American supporters of Save Venice for 
fund raising. ``It's a big schism, a full-blown sail that has been 
torn in half,'' said Nan Kempner, the socialite, who spends three 
weeks a year in Venice and has attended many Save Venice galas. Founded 
36 years ago, Save Venice restores buildings and artworks damaged 
by floods in the Italian city, which is sinking. Most recently it 
raised $4 million for the Renaissance church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli, 
which reopened this year. But like many charities that rely on big-city 
galas for the bulk of their fund raising, Save Venice is known as 
well for its social opportunities as for its good works. At an annual 
masked ball in New York, with tickets costing $1,000 for people 35 
and older, revelers dress elaborately as 17th-century Italian courtesans 
and human gondolas. ``People think it's very cool because it's European,'' 
said one New Yorker in his 40s who attends many charity soirees. ``Europe 
always has an allure of being more sophisticated.'' The most fabulous 
festivities have been in palazzi in and around Venice every other 
year during the city's Regatta Week. Americans rubbed elbows with 
titled Italians in spectacular homes the public never sees. Last year 
these included the Cantina di Vistorta, owned by the Brandolini d'Abba 
family; Castello Roncade, owned by a baron and a baroness, and the 
Palazzo Pisani Moretta, where there was dancing to the the Peter Duchin 
Orchestra and entertainment by Bobby Short. If, back in the States, 
some guests dropped a line like ``Last week, when I was at Countess 
Brandolini's ...,'' it would not have been the first time an American 
had suggested a connection to European aristocracy to burnish social 
status. The access to titled Italians was thanks to Laurence Lovett, 
an American philanthropist who lives on the Grand Canal in Venice 
in a magnificent palace a stone's throw from the Rialto Bridge. Lovett, 
an heir to the Piggly Wiggly supermarket fortune, who was the international 
chairman of Save Venice, is socially connected to European aristocracy 
as well as to old-line New York. He was primarily responsible for 
opening the gates of the Italian city to Americans deemed socially 
worthy. But those gates could be closing. Several people who were 
at the board meeting, on Sept. 14, said Lovett was incensed by a vote 
removing his sister-in-law, Betsy Lovett, from the board. Lovett announced 
his resignation, walking out with his supporters, including Marchesa 
Barbara Berlingieri; Alexis Gregory, the publisher of Vendome Books 
in New York; and Lee Thaw, a prominent New York hostess. Eventually, 
a majority of the Italians followed Lovett. ``The social set has left,'' 
said Dr. Randolph Guthrie, who remains the chairman of Save Venice. 
``There are two groups. One group thinks we're in the restoration 
business in order to have parties and have royals around, and the 
other group _ that's ours _ is throwing parties to have restorations.'' 
Guthrie, a plastic surgeon whose medical office is in an Upper East 
Side town house that also houses Save Venice's offices, said that 
in recent years the social dimension of the group _ and particularly 
the presence of titled Europeans who, he said, contributed little 
financially _ had overshadowed the art-restoration goals. He blamed 
Lovett and his aristocratic friends for that transformation. Guthrie 
recalled an incident in which an American donor was at a party with 
Princess Michael of Kent. ``This nice lady, a big donor to Save Venice, 
asked the princess what she should call her,'' Guthrie said. The princess 
replied, he said, ``Call me ma'am.'' The American retorted that her 
country had fought a revolution to avoid genuflecting before aristocrats. 
``I was annoyed,'' Guthrie said. ``Everyone's there to raise money 
for Save Venice, and the royals; they weren't doing that. They were 
swanning. Swan, swan, swan.'' Mrs. Lovett replied that the titled 
Europeans served to draw American donors, thus helping to raise money. 
``Yes, we're social,'' she said. ``Yes. Life is social. There was 
great joy in having wonderful events that would open Venice to people 
everywhere.'' Many involved with Save Venice say the schism between 
Guthrie and the Lovetts had long been simmering, and that it involved 
personality conflicts as well as disagreements over the group's direction. 
Lovett and his supporters praise Guthrie's successful fund raising. 
The group had never raised more than $30,000 a year until Guthrie's 
wife, Beatrice Guthrie, was hired as executive director about 12 years 
ago, along with a professional staff. Now the charity raises about 
$1 million annually. But privately, Lovett's faction maintains that 
Guthrie let the New York parties grow too big and too public, with 
splashy press coverage, and that in the hands of him and his wife, 
the biannual Venice trips _ for which 300 tickets were sold _ were 
opened to too broad a group. Save Venice lost its aura of exclusivity, 
the Lovett faction says. Before the September board meeting, Lovett 
and his supporters had sought to move the group's headquarters to 
Venice, significantly reducing Dr. and Mrs. Guthrie's control. ``They 
went power-crazy,'' said a former board member, a partisan of Lovett 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``They wanted all the credit. 
It was all about their social progress.'' Lovett said he now plans 
to start a new charity with a similar mission. He has not settled 
on a name. ``It was a question of ethics and human dignity,'' he said, 
explaining his resignation. ``I did not want to serve any longer as 
an officer or board member with some of the present officers.'' Meanwhile, 
Save Venice is proceeding with its plans for its winter gala, called 
the Crystal Carnival, which is scheduled for Feb. 23 at the Plaza. 
Far from scaling back the festivities, the organizers are expecting 
hundreds dressed in Venetian carnival costumes _ some of whom may 
be lured more by the prospects of a glamorous night of dress-up than 
a worthy cause. ``Let's face it,'' said one habitual gala-goer in 
New York. ``Some people don't care whether the party is for Save Venice 
or for Save Chicago. The parties are fun. Do people care about Venice? 
It could be save Fort Lauderdale From Spring Break and they'd go.''
