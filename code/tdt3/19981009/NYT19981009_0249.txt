Today's music may sound a lot different than what I listened to 25 
years ago, but I take comfort in the fact that the lyrics are just 
as indecipherable now as they were then. If nothing else, indecipherable 
lyrics discourage people from ``singing along'' to their favorite 
song, thus saving the nerves and ears of the rest of us from irreparable 
damage. Flailing away at an air guitar or flapping about the room 
like a loon in heat is one thing; attempting to sing, out loud, the 
chorus of ``Blinded by the Light'' is another thing entirely. I mention 
``Blinded by the Light'' specifically because few song lyrics have 
generated as much confusion in the minds of listeners as these, written 
by one of the most incomprehensible composers of our time, Bruce Springsteen. 
If you are into computers (and there is certainly no good reason why 
you should be), you will find an entire web page (http://www.kissthisguy.com/) 
devoted to possible translations of the chorus, as suggested by hundreds 
of earnest, if somewhat underoccupied, fans. Some of the more plausible 
guesses include: (bullet) Held up like a loofah by the foreman of 
the night. (bullet) Shot loose like a goose, another runner in the 
night. (bullet) Revved up my big Dodge and did a runner with his wife. 
(bullet) Rabbit in a lot of juice, like a doughnut in the night. (bullet) 
Racked up like a moose, that's been run over in the night. (bullet) 
Caught up at the juice bar in the middle of the night. (bullet) Wake 
up like a dachshund in the middle of the night. And my personal favorite: 
(bullet) Throw up blah blah blah in the middle of the night. (The 
actual lyrics, for what they're worth, are: ``Blinded by the light/Revved 
up like a deuce/Another runner in the night.'' Just further proof 
that truth is not always stranger than fiction.) The Web site, by 
the way, is named after one of the more famous misheard lyrics from 
the song ``Purple Haze'' by Jimi Hendrix. The actual lyrics were ``Scuse 
me while I kiss the sky'' but many fans (this one included) thought 
Hendrix said ``Scuse me while I kiss this guy.'' Older (or younger) 
readers who find this error to be rather lame should keep in mind 
that this all took place in the '60s and Hendrix concerts were very 
loud and the concert halls were invariably filled with a lot of fog, 
or something, that distorted the lyrics. So lighten up. Anyone can 
mishear a lyric, of course, but to qualify as a classic, a misheard 
lyric must meet two criteria: 1) You must believe your misheard version 
is better than the original, and 2) You must have convinced at least 
one other person that your version is correct. Until recently, I, 
and millions of other rock fans who suffered greater or lesser degrees 
of hearing loss during the '60s, firmly believed that the Creedence 
Clearwater Revival song ``Bad Moon Rising'' contained the lyric ``There's 
a bathroom on the right,'' when the actual words were, obviously, 
``There's a bad moon on the rise.'' We assumed, I guess, that lead 
singer John Fogarty was simply giving us concert-goers some useful 
information, though, in hindsight, it did seem like an odd thing to 
put in a song. In my defense, I can only say that I didn't take it 
as far as Creedence fan Rick Marks did. Marks not only got the ``Bad 
moon on the rise'' part wrong, he also misheard the line, ``I think 
we're in for nasty weather'' to read, ``I think we're in for mashed 
potatoes.'' Another song that has been misheard is ``Witchy Woman'' 
by The Eagles. Benjamin Dover, somehow, misheard the title line as, 
``OoohhOoo, windshield woman/See how high she flies/OoohhOoo, windshield 
woman/She got the moon in her eyes.'' ``I thought,'' said Dover, ``that 
the song was about some zoned-out freak riding around in his car while 
having ghostly hallucinations through his windshield.'' The embarrassing 
moment of revelation came, predictably enough, when Dover read the 
song title on the album jacket. To his credit, Dover believes that 
his version of the lyrics is better than the original and claims to 
have convinced at least one friend that his version is the correct 
one. TV theme songs are frequently misheard, which is a double tragedy 
as some of these tunes are like steel plates, so permanently embedded 
are they in our skulls. Many people have misheard the line in the 
theme song to ``All in the Family'' that goes, ``Gee, our old LaSalle 
ran great.'' Versions that are either better or worse than the original, 
depending on your point of view, include, ``Gee, those were the salad 
days,'' ``Gee, I love old sour grapes'' and the truly bizarre, ``G.R.O. 
LaSalle Redgrave.'' ``The Flintstones'' theme song has given me trouble 
ever since the show debuted in 1960. I speaking specifically of the 
line ``Let's ride/With the family down the street/Through the/Blah 
blah blah blah blah blah blah.'' I thought, possibly, that the missing 
line was ``Making friends with all they meet,'' but that didn't seem 
likely as Fred's grumpy nature didn't win him a lot of friends. A 
more plausible possibility might be, ``And see how much old Fred can 
eat'' as Fred had quite the appetite, though it was unclear why anyone 
would want to ride around with this family just to watch Fred gorge 
himself. But now, after all these years, thanks to The Archive of 
Misheard Lyrics, I know that the actual line is ``Courtesy of Fred's 
two feet.'' Personally, I think my lyrics are better than the real 
ones. And my dog agrees with me. (David Grimes is a columnist for
