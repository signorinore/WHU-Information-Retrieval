On a late autumn afternoon, the sun was pouring through the broad 
windows in Dr. Pat Wexler's office, the decor of which can best be 
described as French provincial meets the Museum of Modern Art's design 
store. Dr. Wexler, the dermatologist, was sitting behind an antique 
desk, wearing a brown dress, jacket, and sling-backs from Bergdorf 
Goodman. ``They're so Blahnik, aren't they?'' she said, holding one 
of her pale feet aloft. She is a well-tended 47-year-old woman with 
skin like creme fraiche and a personality as soothing as buttermilk. 
Unlike her last client. ``Oh my, she was demanding,'' Dr. Wexler said, 
describing her last patient on this afternoon as a high-maintenance 
Russian beauty. ``She wants everything done to her, and I told her 
there was just nothing more to be done.'' Dr. Wexler has earned a 
reputation for being a skin genie as well as a comfy, if sometimes 
stern, Jewish mother. She does everyone: Hollywood starlets, Manhattan 
judges, corporate chieftains and Upper East Side matrons. They turn 
to her for her skill wielding a Botox needle and because she is willing 
to stare into a patient's eyes, grasp her hand, and say, ``Honey, 
you just don't need to do that.'' The actress Ellen Barkin, who gets 
facial peels at Dr. Wexler's office as often as she can, even though 
she lives in Los Angeles, said: ``I talk to her at least once a week. 
I consult with her on everything and consider her not only one of 
my closest friends, but also my primary doctor.'' Ms. Barkin said 
she does not go to Dr. Wexler for one of her better-known specialties, 
liposuction. On a side table in Dr. Wexler's office sits a stack of 
coffee-table books: Judith Leiber's ``The Art of the Handbag,'' Gary 
Goldschneider's ``The Secret Language of Relationships: Your Complete 
Personology Guide to Any Relationship With Anyone'' and Faith Popcorn's 
``Clicking.'' In the corner of her office, dangling from the handlebars 
of a sparkling Schwinn stationary bicycle is a black patent-leather 
purse. On the walls are photographs by Sally Gall, Amy Arbus and Cindy 
Sherman. ``She's a girl, she's a girlfriend, she's reassuring and 
she's calming,'' Ms. Barkin said. Dr. Wexler began her career as an 
internist, specializing in infectious diseases. But after deciding 
that it was too emotionally wearing to treat seriously ill patients, 
she went back for a residency in dermatology. She opened an office 
in Greenwich Village in the early 1980s, and began her practice treating 
models. Now she has two children, a urologist husband and a client 
list that includes 10,000 patients _ and lots of theories about aging 
and the onset of midlife crisis. ``Forty-three is really when you 
start to look in the mirror and think, `Oh my, that's my mother,''' 
Dr. Wexler said, examining her own outstretched hands. ``Most of my 
patients come in miserable at 43.'' These days, Dr. Wexler also treats 
many men and has theories on them, too. ``For men, the big turning 
points are 40 and 60,'' she said. ``For women, they're 30 and 50. 
For some reasons, marriages break up on even decades like 20 and 30 
years, not 25 years. I don't know why. But then the men get out and 
they're 60 and they really think that the 30-year-old woman wants 
them! What a laugh.'' Like many dermatologists, in recent years Dr. 
Wexler has picked up some practices from the field of plastic surgery, 
like liposuction. On men, she'll liposuction their love handles and 
Botox their brows. On women, she does everything, from liposuction 
to glycolic facial peels to administering Botox and plumping lips 
with collagen. ``Botox is like grooming now. It's socially acceptable, 
even expected,'' she said. Poring over her before-and-after book, 
she was frank about the beautification process. ``This is a 50-year-old 
woman,'' she said, pointing at a picture of a nude woman with a paunchy 
belly. On the next page was a photo of the same woman, with a flat 
stomach. ``This woman can wear a suit,'' she said, pointing to the 
flat tummy. ``And this woman can wear a muumuu. See the difference?'' 
She won't disclose her patient list, although it includes famous actresses, 
politicians, judges and models. Dr. Wexler did admit to treating ``Donna'' 
(meaning Donna Karan) and ``Streisand.'' ``But that came from them, 
not me,'' she said, pointing to a framed article from W magazine hanging 
on an examination-room wall that mentioned the two women. Beside it, 
mounted like diplomas, are articles from Allure and Tatler. Treatment, 
or even a conversation, with Dr. Wexler does not come cheap. Just 
to sit down and talk to Dr. Wexler costs $350. Botox treatments start 
at $500; maintenance injections are required every few months. Liposuction 
starts at $2,500 and can cost as much as $11,000. Collagen and laser 
treatments run from $4,000 to $6,000. Dr. Wexler said her waiting 
list is three months long. If a patient calls, the receptionist will 
kindly explain that the doctor is mostly concentrating on cosmetic 
surgery these days. If it's urgent, she'll try and sneak you in in 
late November. Last year, after realizing that her pool of patients 
was enough to keep her busy for quite a while, she stopped seeing 
new patients at all. ``People got mad, that's for sure,'' she said. 
Ms. Barkin said: ``I can understand why. I'm utterly dependent on 
her.''
