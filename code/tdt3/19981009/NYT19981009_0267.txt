On a rainy Thursday evening two days after the release of Duncan Sheik's 
second album, he was padding barefoot around his guitar-strewn loft, 
muttering, ``This is insane.'' Sheik, 28, a singer-songwriter known 
as much for his boyish looks and social calendar as for his contemplative 
pop music, meant his phone, which kept ringing. An executive at Atlantic 
Records called to discuss Sheik's appearance the day before on ``Late 
Night With Conan O'Brien.'' Then there were calls to coordinate plans 
with friends to meet later at Surya, an Indian bistro in Greenwich 
Village. Sheik is a sleepy-eyed native of South Carolina with mod 
sideburns and an unlikely British lilt to his voice, who studied semiotics 
at Brown University. There he fell in with what would one day be a 
junior jet set, including Alexander Von Furstenberg and his future 
wife, Alexandra Miller. These days, with the success of the new album, 
``Humming,'' he doesn't get out much. On this night, however, he was 
making a point of seeing ``Maria de Buenos Aires,'' a tango opera 
at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, with Gidon Kremer, a violinist he 
admires. But Sheik was in no hurry. Dressed in low-slung jeans and 
a navy sweater, he ducked between calls into the recording studio 
he has built in his 2,000-square-foot loft. There, Jihae, 23, a willowy 
aspiring singer and model, was waiting to finish recording a song. 
When Jihae, who uses only a single name, headed home to change, Sheik 
went to a liquor store for a bottle of pinot grigio to drink while 
getting ready. After more phone calls and a change of clothes, he 
knelt at a bedside Buddhist shrine between potted trees and chanted. 
``It's an abbreviated version of what I normally do,'' explained Sheik, 
who said he had been practicing Buddhism for nine years. ``Call it 
a speed chant.'' He finally made his way to a waiting limousine and 
picked up Jihae en route, unconcerned that they would miss half the 
performance. Sheik and Jihae discussed Marilyn Manson (``He's like 
a superhero of the '90s,'' Sheik said) and stardom. ``It's that constant 
struggle _ art vs. commerce,'' he said. He left the performance in 
time to beat the crowds and meet his friends. He arrived at Surya 
first for the 10 p.m. reservation and was told the kitchen was closing. 
Sheik hurriedly ordered for the whole party, all of whom straggled 
in by 11:30 for sea bass and conversation about golf, the novel ``Silk'' 
and real estate. In Sheik's crowd, Thursday is not a party night. 
The consensus was not to go on to the Bowery Bar. By midnight, everyone 
was heading home. ``Ah, the vicissitudes of life,'' Sheik sighed, 
looking heavy-lidded. The next morning he had a magazine photo shoot. 
``Ah, the deepness of Duncan,'' Jihae said.
