``You cannot imagine what I have done!'' Rodion Raskolnikov shouts 
angrily at his best friend, Dmitri. Dmitri (Eddie Marsan) pauses, 
looks his friend directly in the eye and says, slowly, almost in a 
whisper, ``Yes, Rodya, I think I can.'' If there were a few more quiet, 
subtle moments like that in the new, two-hour version of Dostoyevsky's 
``Crime and Punishment,'' NBC might have been able to hold its head 
up proudly. As it is, viewers who tune in Sunday night may think they 
have the wrong channel. The movie opens with an attempt to assassinate 
the czar (a scene that is not in the book) and Raskolnikov's arrest 
as a dissident (also not in the book, but it happened to Dostoyevsky). 
As Raskolnikov, Patrick Dempsey (whose previous roles include the 
young Meyer Lansky and the young JFK) rants, raves, breathes heavily, 
writhes with nightmares and frantically talks to himself whenever 
he takes a walk. Ben Kingsley plays Porfiri, the magistrate, as Lt. 
Columbo. Or maybe he just establishes that Peter Falk was playing 
Columbo as Porfiri all these years. The plot of the 1866 novel certainly 
isn't too complicated for prime time. A young student with money problems 
and ego issues murders his neighborhood pawnbroker. Afterward he is 
racked with guilt and pursued by a suspicious policeman. Meanwhile 
he frets about his unmarried sister (who, it turns out, doesn't need 
his financial help after all) and falls in love with a good-hearted 
prostitute (whose love sees him through). Internal novels, those written 
largely in the voice inside a character's head, have always been a 
challenge for filmmakers. Sometimes the voice-over device works (Jeremy 
Irons in Evelyn Waugh's ``Brideshead Revisited''). Sometimes it doesn't 
(too many to count). This production doesn't take the chance. Having 
Raskolnikov wander the streets of St. Petersburg muttering instead 
isn't the problem; it would just be nice if he muttered something 
intelligent. In the novel, his thoughts include revelations: ``It 
suddenly became quite clear and self-evident to him that he had just 
told a horrible lie, that not only now would there not be time for 
him to have a good talk _ it was now out of the question for him to 
SPEAK to anyone about anything ever again.'' In the NBC version, Dempsey 
mumbles nothing more profound than, ``They cannot know it was me,'' 
or, ``No, no, no, no, no.'' And that's another thing. The screenwriter, 
David Stevens (whose work ranges from the film ``Breaker Morant'' 
to the dreadful mini-sequel ``The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years''), 
never lets a character say something once when he or she can say it 
three or four times. ``My sister will marry him because I cannot provide 
for her,'' Raskolnikov grumbles at one point. ``I will not let it 
happen, Dmitri. I will not let my sister sell herself for money. No. 
I will stop it.'' When his sister, Dunya (Lili Horvath), loses her 
job as a governess, she pleads with her employer: ``Please. I beg 
you. I need the job. We have no money.'' Is this any way to condense 
a 600-page book? NBC should be applauded for the effort involved in 
bringing 19th-century Russian fiction to broadcast television. And 
for using Dostoyevsky's name, which the powers that be had originally 
decided against, for fear of scaring off bibliophobic viewers. But 
``Crime and Punishment'' is not only real literature; it's also far 
too readable and accessible to need dumbing down. The sad part is 
that viewers may not be inspired to pick up the book but will dismiss 
it, judging it by this anguished, monosyllabic interpretation. For 
them, a crucial piece of information: Dostoyevsky is in the details.
