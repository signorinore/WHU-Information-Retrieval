NATIONAL FORECAST Dull, damp and rather dismal weather will prevail 
across the Northeast on Saturday as low pressure drifts east along 
the southern New England coast. A large disturbance at 20,000 feet 
over eastern Pennsylvania will circulate cool, moist air from the 
Atlantic into Maine, resulting in periods of heavy rain. Thick clouds 
and lighter showers will linger as far west as the central Appalachians 
where daytime readings will average ten degrees below seasonal levels. 
Mainly sunny, pleasant conditions will dominate the region from the 
central Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast. The morning will be cool in 
the interior South, but afternoon temperatures will return to normal 
readings. A cold front crossing southern Florida will be preceded 
by considerable clouds and scattered showers, but it will turn drier 
across the northern third of the state. Warmer air will stream northward 
into the Plains as low pressure approaches the eastern Rockies. Increasing 
humidity will cause clouds to form in the Missouri Valley. A cold 
front will press southward into Minnesota and the Dakotas while clouds, 
chilly winds and a little rain will be found behind the front. Inclement 
weather with mountain snow and valley rain will occur from central 
Montana to northern Idaho as cool air from the North Pacific pushes 
inland to the central Rockies. Meanwhile, the Northwest will stay 
dull along the Coast with brighter skies across the interior. Winds 
from the east will descend the Sierra, bringing dry and milder weather 
to California. Elsewhere, the desert Southwest will stay seasonably 
hot with abundant sunshine. Focus: Last Minute Upgrade Early Friday, 
Tropical Storm Lisa was located near 43 degrees north latitude over 
the Atlantic Ocean about 650 miles west of the Azore Islands Q a position 
far removed from its breeding grounds over tropical seas. Just as 
the storm started to lose its uniform tropical characteristics and 
undergo a metamorphosis into an extratropical low pressure system, 
the National Hurricane Center upgraded Lisa to a hurricane. The energy 
needed for Tropical Storm Lisa to achieve the higher grade of hurricane 
came from an upper-level low pressure system and its associated temperature 
contrasts.
