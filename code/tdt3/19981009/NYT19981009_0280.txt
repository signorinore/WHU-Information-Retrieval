It was 10 o'clock on a Saturday night, and several hundred people 
were standing around in a record store having a religious experience: 
Burt Bacharach was giving a miniconcert in a megastore. They were 
mostly hip 30-somethings, not candidates for hip replacement. This 
wasn't the Westbury Music Fair; the stage was not revolving. A year 
ago, when Bacharach played that Long Island institution _ an in-the-round 
theater that looked as if it hadn't been redecorated since ``Don't 
Make Me Over'' was a hit _ the composer was joined by his longtime 
muse and psychic friend, Dionne Warwick. Though at the time Bacharach's 
comeback was already under way, there was only a handful of people 
in the place who couldn't qualify for a senior's discount at any multiplex. 
But on Oct. 3 at the new Virgin Megastore on Union Square, the 70-year-old 
composer had a new partner, the former punk Elvis Costello, 44, and 
a younger audience. Together, this twosome has written a new CD, called 
``Painted From Memory.'' The CD's success among a new generation of 
fans begs the question: How did the king of schmaltz become the latest 
word in cool? Bacharach, who with the lyricist Hal David once posed 
the musical question ``Do You Know the Way to San Jose?'' and Costello, 
who in punk's heyday wondered ``(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love 
and Understanding?'' have earned glowing reviews for their new release. 
Press for ``Painted From Memory'' has been tremendous, thanks in part 
to the duo's salesmanship. If you missed them on ``Late Night With 
David Letterman,'' you could have caught them plugging it on the morning 
chat shows. They have made it the album of the moment. On a makeshift 
stage that night at Virgin, Costello, with Bacharach's piano accompaniment, 
soared through a half-dozen songs, including their first collaboration, 
the aching gospel-inspired ``God Give Me Strength,'' from the 1996 
film ``Grace of My Heart.'' The performance was not the extravagant 
affair that their Radio City Music Hall concert promises to be on 
Tuesday night. Bacharach was not wearing a tuxedo but a Polo golf 
shirt with a sweater tied nonchalantly around his shoulders. Still, 
in its impromptu, low-tech, cheeseless fashion, this little performance 
was more spectacular in some ways than the more elaborate concerts 
could hope to be. The evening fed, as do the CD's dozen new songs, 
an audience starved for unabashed sentimentality but too sophisticated 
to gobble up the ``Titanic'' treacle of Celine Dion. It is the same 
audience that applauds a line at the end of John Waters' latest film, 
``Pecker.'' The characters in that art-world satire raise their glasses 
and toast the end of irony. It is wishful thinking on the part of 
those who've wearied of unfunny comedy, horror films about other horror 
films, expensive clothes that look like tatters, and advertising that 
makes fun of the product being sold. Audiences are longing for things 
that simply are what they are _ simply funny, simply moving, simply 
beautiful. Such straightforward emotion has always been Bacharach's 
forte, whether it was Dusty Springfield's ditching her spouse for 
another man ``24 Hours From Tulsa,'' the Carpenters' longing to be 
``Close to You'' or Roberta Flack's reminding us that there's more 
to love than ``Making Love.'' That's what makes him so refreshing 
right now. Costello has called ``Painted From Memory'' a CD about 
heartbreak. But it is the kind of misery that makes you want to hum 
along. It comes at a time when Bacharach is enjoying an enormous resurgence 
of popularity. In recent years, a new generation of fans has discovered 
his work through such vehicles as last year's hit comedy film ``My 
Best Friend's Wedding,'' the soundtrack of which included a reggae 
refashioning of ``I Say a Little Prayer,'' and through other offbeat 
cover versions of his songs. Even the electronic pop band Erasure 
did a chirpy version of the Perry Como hit ``Magic Moments,'' on their 
CD ``Cowboy.'' The TNT cable chanel televised a tribute concert last 
April, featuring contemporary performers like the Ben Folds Five and 
Sheryl Crow, amid enormous hoopla. Meanwhile, concert-style productions 
of ``Promises, Promises'' in New York and Los Angeles acquainted theatergoers 
with the joys of Bacharach. Then there was his cameo in ``Austin Powers: 
International Man of Mystery.'' A three-CD box set of his greatest 
hits _ ``The Look of Love: The Burt Bacharach Collection,'' to be 
released on Nov. 3 _ won't hurt his reputation, either. If ``Painted 
From Memory'' sells well, it just might be a bellwether, signaling 
a return not only of Bacharach but also of honest emotion. If it doesn't, 
to paraphrase one of his hits, I just don't know what I'll do with 
myself.
