I've always found that experiences from everyday life made the best 
drama,'' writes Michael Eisner in ``Work in Progress'' (Random House, 
$27.95), a first-person account of his years at ABC, Paramount Pictures 
and, of course, Walt Disney Co., where he has run things since 1984. 
Alas, much of this real-life narrative has the drama of, say, an annual 
report. Here is the chief executive's message on everything from Disney's 
management feuds to its millennium plans. And, yes, there he is on 
the cover, posing with the Mouse. To be fair, it may be futile to 
expect much more from a sitting corporate chief, especially when the 
corporation is an American icon. Eisner says he wrote his book _ with 
Tony Schwartz, a journalist _ as a kind of mission statement. And 
he discloses that his wife, Jane Breckenridge Eisner, opposed the 
project, viewing such midcareer memoirs as vain and invasive. Still, 
it would have been interesting to glimpse more of the private man 
who has been behind so much popular culture. Or some juicy, inner-circle 
accounts of past Disney deals or decisions. Or a few Big Thoughts, 
as Disney becomes more global, about the company's power over the 
world's collective imagination. Instead, Eisner _ whose business talents 
have long been well regarded _ tells an already familiar tale about 
Disney, with an emphasis on his creative contributions. At the same 
time, he stays away from anything deeper than a surface look at his 
personal life: childhood on Mahhattan's prosperous Park Avenue, summers 
at a beloved Vermont wilderness camp that taught him ``core values,'' 
wholesome mischievousness at boarding school. ``I found a way to balance 
basic respect for authority with youthful rebelliousness,'' he writes. 
(How Mickey-like.) Even his grief, years later, over the death of 
Frank Wells, Disney's No. 2, seems glossed over, as does his ordeal 
with quadruple-bypass surgery. ``Work in Progress,'' in fact, seems 
to let down its guard only when discussing work experiences now safely 
in the past. Eisner started at ABC at 24, developing soap operas and 
game shows and, later, prime-time comedies like ``Welcome Back, Kotter,'' 
``Barney Miller'' and ``Happy Days.'' There he met and worked _ sometimes 
quirkily _ with Barry Diller, who recruited Eisner into the No. 2 
job at Paramount Pictures in 1977 after a decade at ABC. (We learn 
that Diller once clapped a hand over Eisner's mouth to stop him from 
talking in front of a group.) At Paramount, the two were tight-fisted, 
producing movies as cheaply as possible by relying on new, relatively 
unknown talent. The studio made the hit spoof ``Airplane!'' for $6 
million, using a novice director, and netted $83 million; ``48 Hours,'' 
made before Eddie Murphy was expensive, cost $10 million and earned 
$76 million. And another Murphy film, ``Beverly Hills Cop,'' was based 
on an idea that Eisner says he got after being ticketed for speeding 
in California. Nonetheless, in 1984, Eisner was dismissed _ for personal 
reasons, as he tells it _ by Martin Davis, who ran Gulf &AMP; Western, 
then the studio parent. The author's Disney years take up the bulk 
of the book, beginning with the takeover battle that was raging when 
Roy Disney approached Eisner (then at Paramount) about taking the 
top post. As he describes his tenure at Disney _ the remade this-is-not-your-father's 
Disney _ we get a sense of Eisner's popular-culture instincts and 
his much-lauded business acumen: the sharp attention to movie costs, 
the cross-promotions between theme parks and retail shops, the push 
for a greater presence in television. But there is little discussion 
of the controversies at the company. Eisner doesn't discuss the conservative 
backlash against the company's gay-friendly employee policies. (He 
does, however, grapple with the ``authenticity'' issues surrounding 
Disney's failed plans for an American-history theme park near Manassas, 
Va.) What we get, for the most part, is a bland presentation _ a look 
at the new, grown-up films from Miramax and Touchstone, the Capital 
Cities/ABC acquisition, ``The Lion King'' on Broadway, the turnaround 
at Euro Disney (now Disney Paris), the cruise ships. Occasionally, 
there is a glimpse of how deals are done in the rarefied realms of 
really big business: Eisner exchanges ideas on the chairlifts at Aspen 
and engages in buyout banter at a top-level executive retreat in Sun 
Valley. But over all, the reader gets little in the way of an inside 
look at the Magic Kingdom.
