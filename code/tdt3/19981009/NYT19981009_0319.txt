Just as the White House scandal involving Monica Lewinsky has left 
many Americans divided and angry, so it is becoming an increasingly 
public matter of contention among the nation's religious leaders. 
Within their broad ranks, the issue is not whether the president did 
wrong. Instead, the question many clergy members have been wrestling 
with is, what is the pressing moral issue at stake for the nation 
in the scandal? For some, it is Clinton's behavior, while others say 
the scandal is a sad distraction, with the president's personal failings 
getting so much attention as to obscure societal problems to which 
the government ought to respond. Wesley Granberg-Michaelson, who is 
one of the more prominent religious leaders to call for Clinton's 
resignation, said he did so because ``there are those kinds of roles 
where one's character and how one lives one's life as a whole can't 
be totally segregated from one's leadership position.'' Granberg-Michaelson, 
general secretary of the Reformed Church in America, a denomination 
with 180,000 members whose roots in New York City go back to the Dutch, 
said that writing a recent statement asking the President to step 
down was difficult, particularly as he has been a supporter of Clinton's 
policies. But he said his own religious sense told him that a person 
must be accountable in both personal life and public life. He said 
he also believed that effective leaders depended increasingly on being 
able to inspire a sense of community and purpose among subordinates, 
rather than simply handing down decrees. ``I think that one's capacity 
to exercise leadership around the questions of great moral import 
in public policy is related to the level of trust one can engender,'' 
Granberg-Michaelson said. But he is worried about Congress' decision 
to hold impeachment hearings. ``To the extent that the impeachment 
process becomes increasingly partisan, I think it is a political disaster,'' 
he said. In that concern, he is by no means alone, although some others 
come at the issue from a different perspective on the scandal. On 
Wednesday, 32 religious leaders _ top officers in the National Council 
of Churches and several Protestant, Orthodox Christian, Jewish and 
Islamic organizations _ issued a statement declaring that the nation 
needed to avoid impeachment hearings and saying that Clinton's misdoings 
did not qualify as the ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' that the Constitution 
says are impeachable offenses. The statement offered no excuses for 
Clinton. The signers were bluntly critical of his behavior, saying, 
``In his personal conduct, he has violated the fundamental moral teachings 
of our religious traditions.'' But they also said, ``As he continues 
the difficult work of healing himself and his family, the nation must 
turn to the larger moral imperatives that urgently demand our attention.'' 
Those issues, the statement said, include focusing on the need for 
health care among millions of adults and children who lack it, improving 
education, changing campaign finance practices and helping bring peace 
to Kosovo. One of the signers, the Rev. Ronald Paul Brugler, said 
he was concerned that attention was being diverted from ``very serious 
global and national'' issues. ``I also believe very much in forgiveness,'' 
said Brugler, president of the Swedenborgian Church, a small denomination 
whose theology reflects the work of the 18th-century philosopher and 
scientist Emanuel Swedenborg. Rabbi Eric Yoffie, president of the 
Union of American Hebrew Congregations, which represents more than 
800 Reform synagogues, said he and the other signers wanted to get 
beyond ``the narrow way in which the word morality is being bandied 
about at this particular moment.'' Yoffie composed a brief message 
of his own, in which he said political leaders were judged not just 
by their personal moral conduct but also by their ability to carry 
out a biblical mandate to ``execute true justice,'' an even more important 
standard. He included a quotation from the prophet Zechariah, who 
(in the biblical book bearing his name) calls on people to show mercy 
and compassion and not to oppress the poor, widows or orphans. ``The 
prophets had this broad view, and I think we need this,'' Rabbi Yoffie 
said. ``There's tremendous indignation about what Clinton did. I accept 
that,'' he said, but added, ``Where's the indignation about 12 million 
children without health care?''
