Q. I am a computer consultant at a major international bank. Recently, 
my boss and one member of the staff have made anti-Semitic remarks 
that are at best insensitive, at worst fighting words. The agency 
that hired me for the job has acknowledged the problem but says I 
am overstating it. The agency, however, has to defend its client, 
so its sympathies lie with her. I am looking for a job elsewhere, 
and the agency says it is trying to help me. My problem is: How do 
I explain why I am leaving? No future employer wants to hear negative 
comments about a current employer, no matter how justified. A. Remember 
how you were taught as a child that honesty is the best policy? Forget 
it. While you don't want to tell a lie in an interview, committing 
a sin of omission may be your best course in this instance. ``Never 
go negative,'' said Lee E. Miller, an employment lawyer turned human-resources 
executive and author of ``Get More Money on Your Next Job'' (McGraw-Hill, 
1997). ``I don't care what the reason. Nobody wants to be around someone 
like that. Think of it this way: If you were on a first date and you 
spent the entire time bashing your first wife, what do you think your 
date would think?'' When talking with prospective employers, it may 
be better to skip the negatives about the past and emphasize the upbeat 
about the future. ``There are a million reasons one could give for 
wanting to change jobs,'' said Carole A. Pinkett, a former human-resources 
executive with the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Houston and now 
head of human resources at the STP Nuclear Operating Co. in Wadsworth, 
Texas. If necessary, you may even reach into your bag of interview 
cliches, saying you're looking for an advanced opportunity, or a new 
challenge, or a chance to work for a really (fill-in-the-flattering-adjective) 
company. Miller also advises focusing on why you want the position 
in question, not on why you are leaving your current job. ``What is 
it about a particular company that excites you?'' he said. ``If it's 
that the company is fast-growing, concentrate on that.'' A parting 
note: Your decision to abandon ship appears to be the correct one. 
Life is too short to linger in an office environment that is making 
you miserable, Miller said. And even in litigation-happy America, 
taking legal action would most likely bring you more pain than justice. 
(``If you try to fight such behavior in the courts, it can be very 
expensive, and you can be branded a troublemaker,'' Ms. Pinkett said.) 
However, once you are on your way out the door, you might want to 
drop a friendly, thought-you'd-want-to-know letter to the human-resources 
manager at your old employer, explaining your real reasons for leaving. 
(Be sure it contains no hint of nastiness or implied threat.) It might 
not do any good, but if the company's executives are unaware of your 
former boss' behavior, they might appreciate the information. After 
all, the next person in your position might decide that a lawsuit 
is precisely what the doctor ordered. Michelle Cottle is a Washington
