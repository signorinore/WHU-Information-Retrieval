The chief executive of Mattel Inc. likes to wake up every morning 
to CNN Headline News. And she can be certain the television set will 
be on in the morning. After all, it's on when she falls asleep. Yes, 
her husband does mind, but it's a habit she finds hard to break. ``I 
guess it's a fear of missing something that's going on in the world,'' 
she said. Jill Barad does not miss much, and she seems to want the 
same for employees. As she has risen to the top of Mattel, a $4.8 
billion company, she has tried to transform a corporate culture that 
once reminded her more of a bank than a toy maker. When she and her 
top managers want to communicate a message to employees, for example, 
they work up skits and take to a makeshift stage in the cafeteria 
at Mattel's headquarters in El Segundo, Calif. To announce that the 
company was going to make every day casual day, all the senior executives 
dressed up in bathrobes, leather jackets and the like to demonstrate 
fashion do's and don'ts. (Ms. Barad herself has had trouble giving 
up her more formal wardrobe; she says employees kid her about being 
``casually challenged.'') In other skits, Ms. Barad, a onetime drama 
major, has played a beatnik, a rapper and a Star Trek officer. She 
has also replaced Mattel's steady work hours with a schedule that 
is more flexible than Ballet Recital Barbie. Every Friday is now a 
half-day at Mattel, and employees can take off four Fridays of their 
choosing each year. They get 16 hours off every year to volunteer 
at a local school. In addition to vacations, for most employees in 
Mattel's American offices there is a company-wide break at the end 
of December that lasts about two weeks. ``The best people are attracted 
to places that not only fulfill them on an intellectual level, but 
also take into consideration life-style issues,'' she said. ``To ignore 
that and assume it doesn't matter to somebody is pretty naive. I'm 
not saying we don't need people to work; obviously, we need them to 
work harder as it gets tougher in the environment we're in. But we 
also need to understand the need of people who are being creative 
to have that down time.'' For Ms. Barad, 47, the down time at work 
is nonexistent, and she said her energy level could sometimes wear 
on her colleagues. But it is that drive that helped build sales of 
Barbie under her direction from $200 million in 1982 to $1.9 billion 
in 1997, the year she became chief executive. Her challenge has also 
grown more difficult of late. Mattel, the world's largest toy company, 
announced late last month that earnings growth for the year would 
be about 9 to 12 percent, rather than the 18 percent that Wall Street 
had anticipated, because of declining sales to Toys ``R'' Us, the 
retail chain that accounted for 18 percent of Mattel's revenue last 
year. When Ms. Barad was named chief executive, in January 1997, Mattel's 
stock was trading for less than $30 a share. It rose to more than 
$46 in March but has since fallen sharply; it closed Friday at $29.9375. 
Ms. Barad has said that if performance deteriorates sharply, the generous 
time off given to employees as a reward may have to be cut back. Many 
analysts, however, have said that Mattel's overall strategy is sound 
and that the company should return to outperforming broad stock-market 
indexes. Ms. Barad said she typically puts in 11-hour days that are 
filled with meetings _ ``too many, too many'' _ but she focuses on 
areas like marketing and creative solutions where she feels she can 
contribute the most. A recent Barad brainstorm, for example, led to 
Mattel's plan to offer visitors to its Web site the chance to design 
their own one-of-a-kind friend of Barbie called ``My Design.'' The 
specifications are sent directly to a manufacturing facility (Cost: 
about $40, plus shipping and handling). Ms. Barad also interviews 
candidates for key positions, down to the vice-presidential level, 
in meetings that may last up to an hour. ``Usually that's when defenses 
break down, and that's when you really get to see who is sitting across 
from you,'' she said. ``I really just try to get into the person as 
deeply as I can: what interests them, who are the people they would 
like to spend time with if they could choose anyone, what they do 
when they are not working.'' ``It's difficult to really get to true 
answers about somebody,'' she added. ``Anything that you can do that 
can touch upon a real aspect of the person will give you more insight 
into who they are than any business question. I also like to ask about 
their worst failure, and what they did to overturn it. If it's not 
big enough, they're not a risk taker. And if you've never been put 
in a difficult situation, I don't want you there.'' Once someone joins 
her management team, Ms. Barad said, she is committed to seeing the 
person succeed. ``If things are working out, you won't see me a lot,'' 
she said. ``But if things are not, I will tend to get involved to 
really understand where the issues are and where I can be a support 
system. My job is to shore things up, not to necessarily watch them 
as they break down.'' Ms. Barad said she does get frustrated, though, 
with employees who do not push far enough or hard enough, as Mattel 
will have to do to meet its long-term goal of increasing net income 
by 15 percent every year. ``We don't have years to make things happen,'' 
she said. ``Children change faster than adults, and to be representative 
of where their interests lie, we've got to work very, very quickly.'' 
Ms. Barad is not bashful about her need for down time for herself. 
She said she is typically out the door by 6:30 p.m. to be home for 
dinner with her husband and two teen-age sons. She takes Saturday 
off from work, and after spending Sunday morning on paperwork, she 
spends the rest of the day with her family. She sometimes takes work 
home during the week but not does not expect much from herself late 
at night. ``I figure that by 9 o'clock,'' she said, ``I'm so burned 
out, what am I giving anyway?''
