Ford Motor Co. said Friday that 27 senior executives would retire 
or change jobs at the end of the year, as William Clay Ford Jr. and 
Jacques Nasser began putting their stamp on the company as they move 
toward becoming chairman and chief executive, respectively, on Jan. 
1. The most significant change was the creation of the position of 
chief of staff _ an unusual title in American industry. Ford also 
announced the retirement of its general counsel and its top executives 
for auto manufacturing, auto parts production, engine production, 
quality control, human resources and public relations. The shake-up 
will trim the number of executives at the rank of vice president and 
higher to 40 from 45. Peter Pestillo, an executive vice president, 
was promoted to vice chairman and chief of staff and will oversee 
the general counsel's office, regulatory compliance, government affairs, 
human resources and public relations. While chiefs of staff are common 
in state and federal agencies, the position is rare at big American 
companies. Pestillo, a longtime ally of Ford, said it made sense for 
an automaker to combine a wide range of administrative tasks under 
a single executive. ``These activities interact fairly regularly, 
particularly in a highly regulated industry,'' he said. Wall Street 
loves Pestillo, because his negotiations with the United Automobile 
Workers union have kept Ford free of strikes since 1986, even while 
controlling labor costs. General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. have 
been repeatedly crippled by walkouts. The most prominent and third-youngest 
retiree Friday was Charles Szuluk, the 55-year-old president of Visteon 
Automotive Systems, Ford's huge auto parts division. Ford began taking 
steps two years ago to prepare Visteon to be spun off. But in recent 
months, a consensus has been forming at the company that any such 
move should be delayed for several years, to allow Visteon to win 
more business from other automakers. Szuluk said that his retirement 
reflected satisfaction with the work he had already done at Visteon 
and his desire to ``go to Florida and improve my golf handicap.'' 
Visteon will now be run by less senior executives. Craig Muhlhauser, 
a Ford vice president, will replace Szuluk, who is a group vice president. 
Edward Hagenlocker, the 58-year-old chairman of Visteon and a vice 
chairman of Ford, announced last month that he would retire at the 
end of this year, and has not been replaced. Instead, John Devine, 
Ford's chief financial officer and an executive vice president, will 
add oversight of Visteon to his responsibilities, but no Visteon title. 
Also, Ford named James Padilla, who has turned around the company's 
operations in Latin America, to become group vice president for manufacturing, 
replacing Robert Transou, who is retiring.
