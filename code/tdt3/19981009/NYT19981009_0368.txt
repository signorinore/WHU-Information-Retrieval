As the crowd of mostly young Beijingers filed in from the misty night 
off Tiananmen Square, it was obvious this was not your everyday world 
film premiere. Sure, there were cameras flashing, huge movie posters 
and a high proportion of men with ponytails. But instead of a red 
carpet, there were metal detectors and X-ray security machines. And 
weren't those bouncers People's Liberation Army guards? In an incongruous 
mix of old and new, politics and entertainment, China held its first 
Hollywood-style movie premiere Thursday night. And it chose as its 
theater the epicenter of Chinese politics, the vast auditorium of 
the Great Hall of the People. In wooden seats with narrow desks, where 
Communist Party delegates usually listen to speeches about Deng Xiaoping 
Theory, an eclectic collection of film buffs, foreign movie stars, 
entrepreneurs and government bureaucrats watched the world premiere 
of the Chinese director Chen Kaige's new historical epic, about the 
violent battles that led to the unification of China in 221 B.C. It 
was tantamount to having ``Saving Private Ryan'' first screened on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate. In a night of incongruities, perhaps 
the greatest of all was simply seeing Chen, whose films are often 
banned or cut in his homeland, celebrate and be celebrated on the 
stage normally occupied by the likes of President Jiang Zemin. The 
film's producers applied to rent the hall for the world premiere after 
Chinese censors signed off on the film a few weeks ago. And to everyone's 
surprise, they were told they could. ``It is beyond my imagination 
that one of my films could be shown in the Great Hall of the People 
_ like a dream,'' Chen said. ``It's a change. Is it a reason for optimism? 
I don't know.'' Although the event was tame by Western standards _ 
stretch limousines and Versace were out, Volkswagens and tight jeans 
were in _ many in the crowd enjoyed the buzz. After the film a number 
headed out to a late-night champagne reception at a trendy French 
club called Maxim's. ``This is the first time I've taken part in a 
premiere,'' Wang Zhiwen, a popular young Chinese actor and one of 
the movie's male leads, said as he drew on a cigarette under the club's 
low stained-glass ceiling. ``It's the first time in Chinese cinematic 
history that it has occurred. It's not bad. I think it's necessary, 
and now that there's been a first, there's bound to be a second and 
a third.'' Tickets were hard to get for the film, a big-budget sweeping 
story about a king's increasingly ruthless attempts to fulfill his 
vision of a unified nation and an assassin's attempt to thwart his 
violent march. (King Qin lives to prevail over his enemies, becoming 
China's first emperor.) It features some of China's biggest stars, 
including Li Xuejian as the king, who believes that all means of killing 
and torture are justified by his noble goal, and Gong Li, already 
well known in the West, as his beautiful girlfriend, who ultimately 
is so repulsed by his cruelty that she helps arrange an assassination 
attempt against him, which fails. Literally translated, the movie's 
title is ``Jingke Stabs the Qin Emperor'' _ Jingke is the hired killer. 
Even government officials who called at the last minute for tickets 
had to be turned away. ``The past few days, the phone hasn't stopped 
ringing with people asking for tickets,'' Chen, wearing a dark suit, 
said from the Great Hall's cavernous stage. ``I thank you for your 
presence, and I apologize to friends who couldn't get them.'' Chinese 
who attended the film, which lasts nearly three hours, said they enjoyed 
it, though some quibbled with its historical accuracy. ``It was very 
authentic and brought to life a period that we mostly know through 
books in school,'' said Zhang Pu, a stylish women in a short black 
suit who said a friend involved with the movie had given her a ticket. 
As he walked toward his white late-model car, Wang Shangli, a prosperous-looking 
businessman wearing a gold chain and diamond ring, said: ``It's the 
first time such a big epic film has been made in China. I think it's 
good.'' Chen, who won the Cannes Palme d'Or in 1993 for his banned 
``Farewell My Concubine,'' said this was the first of his seven films 
that the Chinese censors had approved unconditionally. Nonetheless, 
Chen, who despite world acclaim has previously insisted on making 
his films in Chinese and in China, said he would make his next movie 
in the United States and in English, in part to avoid the political 
and financial hassles of filmmaking in his homeland. On its surface 
the new film is an apolitical, even vaguely patriotic rendering of 
the founding of China. But it is also a not-so-subtle allegory about 
a once-idealistic leader turned dictator that parallels China's current 
political situation in some respects. ``Rulers of China always promise 
to give people a better life,'' Chen said in an interview. ``But how 
do you get there? How do you achieve your goal? What they have ended 
up doing is often against their dreams.'' In the movie, the king buries 
whole cities of children alive in the name of creating a ``bountiful 
nation.'' The film will be distributed by Sony in the United States, 
where its English title will be either ``The First Emperor'' or ``Assassin.'' 
With its $10 million budget and vast, fast-paced battle scenes, the 
movie was a first for Chinese cinema. Thousands of extras _ soldiers 
from the Chinese Army _ were moved around the country. ``It was difficult,'' 
a weary-looking Chen said. ``I'm not very experienced at how to make 
action movies.'' But he and the stars seemed right at home on Thursday 
night at Maxim's as they sat on a plush banquette amid the flash of 
cameras, drinking champagne and smoking cigarettes. Across the room 
a Japanese camera crew followed Honami Suzuki, a popular Japanese 
actress, who had flown in from Tokyo for the occasion. The actor Li 
Xuejian, who played the King of Qin, agreed that there would be more 
premieres to come. As he left Maxim's, beaming, briefcase in hand, 
Li, who often stars in modern-day dramas, was asked how it felt to 
play a king-turned-emperor, honored at such an event, in such a vast, 
ambitious film. ``It's very addicting!'' he said.
