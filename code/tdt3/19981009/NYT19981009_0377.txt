It remains one of the most memorable letters I've ever received, up 
there with my acceptance to college and the emotive notification from 
my mother that my childhood pet cat, Noodle, was dead. It was the 
early 90s, and I was back from two years working and traveling in 
Asia, where I had been mightily impressed with the so-called tiger 
economies. I had put a full quarter of my individual retirement account 
into the T. Rowe Price New Asia fund. My money had doubled in a matter 
of months, and I was sure that was just the beginning. I'd seen those 
hard-working Asians with my own eyes, riding three to a scooter to 
their Japanese-financed factories and the nirvana of assembling fluorescent 
tubes for $3 a day. History belonged to them, and New Asia was making 
me a player. Then, in November 1993, along came a missive, postmarked 
Baltimore, that had an effect not unlike that of a ``Dear Eric'' letter 
putting the brakes on a rapturous love affair. After starting off 
buoyantly, Martin G. Wade, the president of the fund, delivered what 
I still remember as a shocker. ``A fund like New Asia should not represent 
a major portion of your equity assets,'' he wrote. It was like being 
hit with the ``Let's just be friends'' line. Wade was right, of course. 
The fund peaked a month later, slid back to the price where I'd bought 
it and is still falling. On Oct. 1, assets were down to $543 million, 
from $1.6 billion when Wade wrote his letter. Of course, fund companies 
are not always so blunt. At times it's important to read the subtext 
of their communications. Consider the nuanced language in the current 
ad campaign of Fidelity Investments, starring Peter Lynch and Lily 
Tomlin. Its slogan, ``Know what you own and know why you own it,'' 
invites the investor to share the burden of understanding investments 
with Fidelity. ``You're responsible, too,'' is the message I hear. 
Most often, letters to shareholders seem designed to counteract a 
different sort of advertising, the kind that blares about performance 
and that often persuades people to put money into the fund in the 
first place. An example from James E. Stowers, president of Twentieth 
Century Investors (now American Century), went out in November 1991, 
when the Ultra Fund basked in the glow of 12-month returns of almost 
80 percent. ``This short-term progress, while exciting, is not sustainable 
for either Ultra or any other conventional investment,'' Stowers warned. 
But if the letter was meant to discourage investments, it didn't work. 
Assets continued to flow in, leading Stowers to follow up in May 1992 
with a note that said, ``We think it is important for our investors 
to understand the short-term risks involved in common-stock investing.'' 
The concern for caution that fund companies show in these letters 
is sometimes matched only by the contrition they profess after turning 
in poor performance. Years after Stowers' letters, when American Century's 
Vista fund was underperforming, the company sent out a letter expressing 
abject humility. ``The fund's 1997 return was disappointing _ it lost 
value during a year which saw strong stock performance,'' wrote Robert 
C. Puff, the chief investment officer. ``We have spent many hours 
examining why Vista's recent results did not achieve what we had hoped.'' 
Puff, who I imagined garbed in sackcloth, concluded, ``Thank you for 
your patience.'' The market leader in lowering expectations, though, 
may be the Vanguard Group of Malvern, Pa. In March 1996, John J. Brennan, 
the chairman of Vanguard, wrote to investors in its famous index funds, 
then being showered with good press, to express concern that ``given 
all the recent publicity, and its focus on indexing's extraordinary 
returns, investors may not fully appreciate the risks associated with 
an investment in stocks through one of the portfolios of Vanguard 
Index Trust.'' In 1997, Brennan did a stint on the customer-service 
phones, and was so alarmed to hear investors say they expected index 
funds to keep returning 20 percent a year that he made the communications 
department bump a manager profile from the shareholder newsletter 
and replace it with a special piece on investment risk. It may be 
wise to listen to such advice. Brennan's warning in the June 30 semiannual 
report this year, just before the market peak, was this: ``Though 
we claim no predictive powers, we feel safe in saying that such outsized 
returns can't continue indefinitely.'' And you didn't have to pay 
a broker to tell you that.
