By all accounts, President Clinton plans to veto the bankruptcy bill 
now in the final stages of approval in the Republican Congress. But 
many debtors aren't taking any chances. Lawyers across the country 
are reporting a surge in bankruptcy filings by clients rushing to 
beat the tough new standards in legislation agreed to by House and 
Senate negotiators on Wednesday and passed by the House on Friday. 
The agreement would force many families of four making more than $51,000 
a year, and individuals making more than $17,900, to repay part or 
all of their credit card bills and other unsecured debts by going 
into Chapter 13 bankruptcy, instead of walking away from them by filing 
Chapter 7, which cancels most debts. The White House said President 
Clinton was unlikely to sign the measure, but lawyers for debtors 
said many consumers couldn't afford the risk that he would change 
his mind. ``If they are going to have to file, we recommend that they 
do it without waiting,'' said Melvin Kaplan, a bankruptcy lawyer in 
Chicago who handles about 1,000 cases annually and whose business 
has shot up 40 percent over the past month. William Binzel, vice president 
for government affairs for Mastercard International, said bankruptcy 
lawyers were creating a sense of panic among debtors when none was 
warranted. ``Income is only the first threshold,'' he said of the 
proposed rules. ``Then judges will look at expenses in each metropolitan 
area'' to determine if a debtor can pay some credit card bills. But 
Charles Juntikka, a bankruptcy lawyer in Manhattan, disagreed. ``If 
your Chapter 13 fails because you get sick or lose your job or your 
car gets stolen, this bill says that you could be denied refuge in 
Chapter 7 and be thrown to the mercy of the credit card companies,'' 
he said. ``Whether you could stay in bankruptcy would depend on the 
luck of the draw as to what judge you get, and that introduces a degree 
of uncertainty that makes it crazy to delay filing.'' Juntikka said 
his business had increased by a third in recent weeks and he had four 
dozen files on his desk representing people who could be forced into 
Chapter 13 under the proposed rules. The plight of one of his clients, 
Elaine Salmon, 43, a city corrections officer at the Bronx House of 
Detention for Men, illustrates the problems many consumers face. Because 
Ms. Salmon makes a $35,000 base salary, she would be forced into Chapter 
13 under the rules in the bill. But while her income places her statistically 
in the ranks of the middle class, she said her finances had been devastated 
by a marital separation, her 9-year-old daughter's illnesses and the 
theft of her Jeep, on which she has been unable to collect insurance 
compensation. She is sinking under $36,200 in unsecured debt. To ease 
the burden, Ms. Salmon took her daughter out of Catholic school and 
ended the girl's skating lessons. But, realizing such moves were ineffectual 
against debt so large, she went to Juntikka's office on Wednesday 
to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy papers. ``I'm not living some high life 
like the banks are saying on the television,'' Ms. Salmon said, referring 
to assertions of abuse of bankruptcy by debtors. The credit card industry 
says the overhaul is needed to reverse an explosion of personal-bankruptcy 
filings to a record 728,000 in the first half of this year and to 
force deadbeats to repay some debt. But critics say the bill would 
not stop abuses by wealthy individuals, who could put their assets 
into homes in Florida or Texas, where state laws protect even the 
most expensive homes from creditors so long as they bought the homes 
two years or more before filing bankruptcy. Norma Hammes of San Jose, 
Calif., the president of the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy 
Lawyers, called the final legislation ``a nightmare for consumers.'' 
``I have little red sticky tags on about 20 cases,'' she said. She 
has flagged them to be filed immediately if the bill is sent to the 
White House. And H. Jason Gold of Gold &AMP; Stanley in Alexandria, 
Va., a lawyer who represents creditors, said that if the bill became 
law it would prove impractical and be ``bound to fail'' because it 
didn't reflect the economic realities that debtors face.
