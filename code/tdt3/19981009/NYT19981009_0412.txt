A day after the House authorized an impeachment inquiry into President 
Clinton, Judiciary Committee members appear to be at odds over what 
kind of investigation to conduct, with Democrats pushing to summon 
a parade of players in the scandal and Republicans suggesting narrowing 
the witness list. Democrats say they would like to call the central 
characters in the Lewinsky scandal to judge their credibility. That 
potential list includes Monica Lewinsky; her mother, Marcia Lewis; 
the woman who surreptitiously tape-recorded Ms. Lewinsky's conversations, 
Linda Tripp; Clinton's confidant Vernon Jordan; and Betty Currie, 
Clinton's secretary. And Democrats said they would be interested in 
shining the spotlight on independent counsel Kenneth Starr, calling 
him as a witness to quiz him about purported ``leaks'' from his office, 
the way he conducted his investigation and his relationship with Mrs. 
Tripp. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Henry Hyde, who initially 
opposed calling Starr, said Friday that he would not object if Democrats 
subpoenaed Starr. ``The reality is that they'd be clobbered politically 
if they didn't call Kenneth Starr,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., 
a member of the panel. But Republicans are reluctant to summon a roster 
of players before the committee, hoping instead to rely on the witnesses' 
depositions and grand jury testimony. ``It's not our responsibility 
to conduct a full-scale trial,'' said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., 
a member of the panel, who wants to call Bruce Lindsey, a deputy White 
House counsel and close Clinton adviser. ``The Constitution gives 
the Senate the power to try.'' Hyde, R-Ill., said he saw ``no need'' 
to call Ms. Lewinsky, who testified to the grand jury under an immunity 
agreement that he said gave her no reason to lie. But a lawyer familiar 
with the proceedings said Republicans are weighing whether to call 
Mrs. Tripp. The chairman also said it is unlikely that Clinton would 
be subpoenaed to testify. Clinton's lawyers are invited to attend 
the hearings, which are expected to begin in mid-November, and they 
are free to question witnesses. For now, Republicans are considering 
whether to scale back some of the charges or simply zero in on the 
most important right away, perjury and obstruction of justice, members 
and a Republican official said. But Hyde left open the possibility 
on Friday that the inquiry could wander into other areas, such as 
Clinton's ability to lead. Asked whether he might call high-ranking 
Pentagon officials before the panel to ask if Clinton has retained 
his credibility as commander in chief, Hyde said, ``It's a possibility.'' 
One of the first orders of business for the committee and its staff 
will be to draw up a list of facts and give them to Democrats and 
the White House. An agreement on those facts, called a stipulation, 
could speed up the inquiry. Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, 
is expected to meet with David Schippers, the Republicans' investigative 
counsel, on Tuesday to begin the process in a closed-door meeting. 
Republicans are hoping the White House can stipulate some basic facts, 
such as authenticating phone records and logs. But reaching consensus 
on others, like the differences in testimony between Ms. Lewinsky 
and Clinton about their sexual relationship, could be a lot more difficult, 
they indicated. ``Ideally, we could get some stipulations so we wouldn't 
have to go chasing around to reinvent the wheel,'' Hyde said. ``We 
can find out what we want them to admit and see if we can get some 
stipulations.'' Saying that Republicans need to hold full and fair 
hearings, Rep. Martin Meehan of Massachusetts argued that to accomplish 
that, the key players must be called before the committee. But there 
is a political calculus behind this strategy, as well. ``This is going 
to be a circus and they know it,'' Meehan said. ``It's not the basis 
upon which to impeach the president.'' One Democratic aide said about 
the prospect of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony on national television: ``The 
more you get back into this, the more you look like a sexual inquisitor. 
People are fed up with all of this.'' Under the rules governing the 
inquiry, both Hyde and Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the ranking 
Democrat on the panel, must agree on subpoenas. If there is no agreement, 
Republicans on the committee can vote to overrule Democrats. Democrats 
said Friday that Starr's oversight of the investigation and his use 
of Mrs. Tripp to record conversations, are integral to the case. They 
say they want to establish whether Starr's evidence is tainted and 
whether Starr directed Mrs. Tripp to prod Ms. Lewinsky to ask the 
White House for a job. ``You have to have the person who submitted 
the 445-page report,'' Meehan said. ``You don't have a judicial proceeding 
and have the prosecutor not appear.'' Democrats would also query other 
witnesses about Starr and his tactics, they said.
