With his campaign in demonstrable trouble, Peter Vallone, the Democratic 
candidate for governor of New York, has adopted the novel strategy 
of embracing Bill Clinton, even as most other Democrats are keeping 
the beleaguered _ but still popular _ president at arms' length. In 
his newest advertisement, Vallone, speaker of the New York City Council, 
defends the president, says he has been an ardent supporter of New 
York, and urges the country to move on. ``I think it's time someone 
stood up for President Clinton and stood up to all the Republicans 
who are trying to tear him down,'' Vallone somberly intones, as he 
stares straight into the camera. ``Censure the president if necessary,'' 
the speaker concludes in the 30-second ad, which began airing statewide 
Thursday night. ``Then forgive him and move on for the good in our 
hearts and for the good of our country.'' Other Democratic candidates 
around the country to stand with the president, but Vallone is, according 
to political strategists, the only Democrat running for significant 
office to use a defense of Clinton as a campaign tactic. Even though 
the president remains popular _ even more popular in New York than 
elsewhere _ Vallone's decision to use his dwindling cash to broadcast 
support for the president is surprising. Governors _ and candidates 
for governor _ have no direct involvement with matters of impeachment, 
But the ad does set Vallone apart, which, the speaker's camp is evidently 
hoping, might help his faltering campaign against a popular incumbent. 
The new ad premiered, coincidentally, the same day that a Times/CBS 
News Poll of the governor's race showed the Republican incumbent, 
George Pataki, with a 2-1 lead over Vallone. The poll also indicated 
that the speaker was barely known outside of New York City and that 
even in the city, where registration is overwhelmingly Democratic, 
he and Pataki are in a dead heat: Vallone 39 percent, Pataki 36 percent. 
Vallone's campaign manager, Kevin McCabe, said the campaign was making 
a ``substantial buy'' throughout the state with the ad, which was 
produced by Doak, Carrier &AMP; O'Donnell, but was not specific. As 
of the beginning of this month, Vallone had only $250,000 in his campaign 
treasury, compared to Pataki's $9 million, but the speaker is continuing 
to raise money. Most will go to television advertising, according 
to a campaign aide. McCabe said that he thought Vallone was ``the 
only major candidate in the country on the air defending the president.'' 
A spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, Tony Wyche, agreed. 
``To our knowledge, this is the first such ad, in terms of paid advertising 
by candidates,'' he said. Jennifer Duffy, an editor at the Cook Political 
Report, a national newsletter based in Washington, also said she knew 
of no Democratic candidates running similar advertisements. Several 
Republicans are running political commercials critical of the president, 
she added. McCabe said that the speaker was moved to run the ad because 
he felt strongly about a subject that has obsessed the whole country. 
Referring to Vallone, McCabe said, ``A light goes off in his head: 
`People ought to know where you stand on this stuff.''' Said Vallone, 
``I think that I reflect the opinion of most New Yorkers.'' A New 
York Times/CBS News Poll released this week, well after the Vallone 
campaign says it decided on the new ad, supports Vallone on that score. 
The poll found that while 67 percent of Americans approved of Clinton's 
job performance, New Yorkers had an even more favorable opinion, with 
75 percent saying they approved of the way he was handling his job. 
Roy Roemer, co-chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said 
he thought the Vallone approach would be effective in New York because 
the president remains popular there, but ``it may not be the thing 
you would do in South Carolina.'' In another finding that would encourage 
Vallone's new strategy, registered voters who participated in the 
poll indicated in overwhelming numbers _ 74 percent _ that Clinton's 
troubles would have ``no effect'' on their vote this fall in the race 
for U.S. Senate. Although the question was not asked in the poll of 
the governor's race, it is likely that voters would have similar feelings. 
Given the president's popularity, especially in New York, most political 
analysts described the advertisement as savvy. ``It's not a bad move,'' 
said Henry Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant who is not 
working for a gubernatorial candidate. It gives Vallone ``an instant 
ID on issue people feel strongly about,'' Sheinkopf continued, adding 
that it would also separate him from the Republicans. ``Of course,'' 
he added, ``it has nothing to do with the governor's race.'' Indeed, 
analysts said the advertisement also spoke to the deep trouble Vallone's 
campaign is in just three and a weeks before the primary. Several 
said it was a clear attempt to rally his Democratic base _ African 
Americans, liberals, gays, women and other groups that have generally 
strongly supported Clinton. ``To spend limited resources now appealing 
to people so close to you ideologically and politically is a real 
danger sign,'' said Philip Friedman, a political strategist not involved 
in the Vallone-Pataki campaign. ``We're in a difficult race,'' McCabe 
acknowledged. ``But there's some freedom in having a difficult race.'' 
Though governors have no role in impeachment proceedings, Vallone 
defended the ad as relevant because he is the Democrat running for 
the highest office in New York, and in the ad criticizes Pataki and 
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the Republican incumbent. ``Now Al D'Amato, 
George Pataki and the Republican Party are determined to bring the 
president down _ even if it means hurting our country.'' The governor, 
in fact, has maintained a studied silence on the president's travails, 
which drew an attack from Vallone at a news conference on Thursday. 
``I think sometimes silence is worse than taking a stand,'' Vallone 
said. ``I think the governor should come out and take a stand.'' Pataki's 
campaign spokesman, Michael Marr, described the ad as ``nothing more 
than a publicity stunt by a candidate who has no message, no money 
and no momentum.'' Vallone said the White House did not ask him to 
make the ad, nor did he ask its permission. And, he insisted, it was 
not an effort to elicit more fund-raising help from the White House. 
On Wednesday, Vice President Al Gore spent the day campaigning with 
Vallone, including making appearances at two fund-raisers, and Clinton 
is scheduled to campaign with him on Monday. The president will also 
appear with Rep. Charles Schumer of Brooklyn, the Democrat challenging 
D'Amato. Schumer has not shied away from Clinton, though he is not 
featuring him in any ads. Earlier in this campaign season, Vallone 
did distance himself from the president. He declined to attend Clinton's 
fund-raiser for the Democratic Party the night before the Democratic 
primary, first saying that he had pressing campaign commitments and 
then that he wanted to have dinner with his wife. He is not the only 
candidate now trying align himself with the president as Election 
Day nears. In September, Parris Glendening, the Democratic governor 
of Maryland, publicly snubbed the president, declining to show up 
at an event with him and then canceling a planned fund-raiser with 
him. But a month later, he backtracked, seeking Clinton's help campaigning, 
as polls showed his opponent, Ellen Sauerbrey, closing in. Political 
analysts said Glendening may have been concerned about losing support 
among traditional Democrats, especially African American voters, who, 
polls have shown, have been consistently supportive of the president. 
Political strategists say Vallone appears to have a similar worry. 
``This is an ad to me that speaks to Democrats, not voters as a group,'' 
said Ms. Duffy, of the Cook Political Report. ``I don't think it's 
going to change the ultimate outcome, but what it might do is prevent 
it from being more of a wipeout.'' Friedman, the political strategist, 
praised Vallone for ``saying the right thing at the right time clearly 
and well.'' Friedman said the advertisement would appeal to core Democrats, 
but said he doubted that people would vote for Vallone because of 
his position on a national issue. If that is the Vallone strategy, 
it is ``a bit of a stretch,'' he added. Vallone said on Thursday that 
he decided to air the commercial not to get more votes, but because 
``it's the right thing to do.'' But McCabe, his campaign manager, 
hinted at a less lofty motive. `We'll see if it starts to resonate,'' 
he said of the commercial. ``We should get some movement.''
