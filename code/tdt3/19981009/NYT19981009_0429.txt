Doctors in New York have become the first to try to make an infertile 
woman pregnant by plucking the genes out of one of her eggs and inserting 
them into a younger woman's egg that has had its own genes removed. 
The resulting hybrid egg is then fertilized and placed into the older 
woman's womb. It is not known whether anyone treated with the technique 
has become pregnant. Although the new technique has been described 
by its developer, Dr. James Grifo of New York University, as an effort 
to help women with longstanding infertility, other scientists have 
called it a step toward human cloning and said it raises troubling 
ethical and medical questions. Grifo declined to be interviewed. Lynn 
O'Dell, a spokeswoman for New York University, said the technique 
was intended to help older women, particularly those for whom in vitro 
fertilization had failed, to give birth to children who are their 
own genetic offspring. Currently, the only way some of those women 
can become pregnant is to use an egg donated by another woman. Grifo 
reported at a medical conference on Thursday that he and his colleagues 
had tried the new technique in just two patients so far. The first 
woman, 47 years old, did not become pregnant, and the second, age 
44, underwent the procedure only last week and has not yet had a pregnancy 
test. The technique is based on the theory that many older women are 
infertile not because of problems with the DNA in their eggs but because 
of the age of the cytoplasm, which contains cell structures, chemicals 
and nutrients needed to support the egg's growth and development. 
Dr. Keith Latham, a developmental biologist at Temple University in 
Philadelphia, said Grifo's technique might have unforeseen risks. 
Combining the cytoplasm of one woman's egg with another woman's genes 
could cause problems, Latham said. Cytoplasm plays an important role 
in programming the expression of genes from both the sperm and the 
egg, he explained. In this case, the maternal genes will have been 
programmed by the older mother's cytoplasm, but then they and the 
sperm will be acted on by the younger woman's cytoplasm. The different 
sets of instructions might conflict, he said. He noted that similar 
experiments in mice had resulted in abnormalities that were passed 
on to succeeding generations. ``You're creating something here that 
never exists in nature,'' he said. ``It's an admirable objective to 
help infertile couples have children, but in this case, the application 
is going way ahead of knowledge of the scientific or biological consequences. 
We have no idea what the potential is for birth defects, or problems 
in children in the next generation. It amounts to experimentation 
on humans.'' Dr. Lee Silver, a molecular biologist at Princeton University, 
said: ``What's most fantastic is that this is exactly the technology 
used for cloning. It's nuclear transfer, exactly what you would do 
in cloning, except in cloning you would be transferring an adult cell.'' 
The technique, Silver said, is just ``the first step along the way'' 
to human cloning. The technique also has philosophical implications, 
he said, because any children from it will carry some genetic material 
that came from the woman who donated the egg. That is because eggs 
contain structures called mitochondria, which are important in cell 
metabolism and also carry genetic material. ``Girls will pass on this 
foreign mitochondrial DNA to all their children, and so on,'' Silver 
said. ``These will be the first germ-line genetically engineered children.''
