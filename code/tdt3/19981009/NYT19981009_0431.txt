Law-enforcement officials announced the indictments Friday of 102 
members of a sophisticated drug operation that discreetly sold millions 
of dollars' worth of crack cocaine to white-collar workers in midtown 
Manhattan over the last decade. Careful not to draw attention to themselves, 
the dealers, from five drug gangs, largely sold their drugs indoors, 
rarely fought over territory and catered to their most cherished customers, 
what the dealers called the ``S and T crowd'' _ the suit and tie crowd 
_ authorities said. Officials said the gang members' practice of selling 
drugs indoors and the fact that they shunned firearms showed the evolution 
and adaptability of the drug trade under the Giuliani administration's 
crackdown on quality-of-life crimes. They said a continuing demand 
for drugs fueled the operation. Half of its $5 million in annual sales 
were made to white-collar workers, investigators said. Business was 
most brisk in the early morning, when office workers arrived for work, 
and at noon, when they went on lunch breaks. Walter Arsenault, assistant 
Manhattan district attorney, said the white-collar workers ``bought 
big and they paid twice as much.'' In a shift from the aggressive, 
gun-toting drug gangs of the early 1990s, the five gangs involved 
apparently shunned confrontation with other gangs to avoid drawing 
police attention. Initially, the gangs operated out of the former 
Evans Hotel at 273 W. 38th St. near Eighth Avenue, and then worked 
around the corner in the Mammoth Pool Hall at 550 Eighth Ave., officials 
said. To avoid warfare, dealers declared a truce and worked out a 
shift schedule among themselves, officials said. Dealers from different 
gangs shared customers and drug supplies and even warned each other 
when police approached, investigators said. In a major shift that 
law-enforcement officials said helps explain the city's plummeting 
homicide rate, disputes among the gangs were settled by slashings 
and stabbings, not by gun battles. Gang members told the police that 
they no longer carry guns because they fear that they will be stopped 
by police officers enforcing the city's crackdown on low-level crimes, 
authorities said. The lucrative operation ended after a rival gang 
from Boston tried to move in on the operation, law-enforcement officials 
said. A shooting in January drew the attention of the police and eventually 
led to Friday's indictments.
