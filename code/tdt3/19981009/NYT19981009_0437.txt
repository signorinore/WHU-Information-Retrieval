With a lone senator standing in the way, a bill to overturn Depression-era 
restrictions on the financial-services industry was put into a legislative 
deep-freeze Friday, its prospects for passage reduced to almost nothing. 
Even though both Democratic and Republican Senate leaders said they 
had nearly 90 votes to pass the measure, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, 
threatened to tie up the Senate in procedural maneuvers out of his 
long-standing opposition to portions of the bill. As a result, Majority 
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., added two unrelated ``poison pill'' amendments 
to the bill, which had the effect of shelving the measure unless Gramm's 
opposition ends. The measure, passed by the House last May, would 
lift legal barriers and allow banks, securities firms and insurance 
companies to merge with fewer regulatory restrictions than they now 
face. For senators who had been working for decades to enact the measure, 
Friday's events came as a bitter disappointment. Sen. Christopher 
Dodd, D-Conn., said: ``The bill has strong support, but we are down 
to one or two people who are standing in the way of the first real 
successful effort to modernize our banking system in 20 years. It's 
frustrating.'' Gramm, joined by Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., has crusaded 
against portions of the bill that would strengthen the Community Reinvestment 
Act, which requires banks to provide services to low- and moderate-income 
areas. Gramm, who has vowed to kill the bill over this issue, has 
long been a critic of these requirements, although no banking or other 
major industry group supports his view. ``Senator Gramm is standing 
up on principle because he believes CRA is extortion,'' said Larry 
Neal, a spokesman for Gramm. ``And there is a general reluctance to 
believe someone could stand up on principle and do this. Right now, 
the bill seems firmly planted in the grave.'' Gramm would become the 
next chairman of the Senate Banking Committee if the current chairman, 
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., fails to be re-elected next month and 
if Republicans retain control of the Senate. Under the rules of the 
Senate, a single senator can block legislation through procedural 
roadblocks. With enough time, such opposition can be overcome. But 
with the 105th Congress in its final days, there is not enough time 
for backers of the bill to mount a procedural counterattack. As a 
result, unless a compromise with Gramm is reached, the chances are 
high that the bill will die when the session ends. A day earlier, 
Lott tried to get Gramm to budge, through a combination of harsh words 
and public reprobation. On Thursday, Lott, who supports the measure, 
took to the floor to complain about a ``spectacle very unbecoming 
of the Senate'' and vowed ``to use every tool at my disposal and do 
everything possible to make sure who knows who is holding this up.'' 
He was joined by Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., who said the Senate was 
being held ``hostage'' and added that ``I can use the word `extortion''' 
to describe Gramm's opposition. The bill had received the support 
of nearly every financial securities industry group, the result of 
carefully crafted legislative compromises to get the bill through 
the House. It was also the target of heavy lobbying by Citigroup, 
the new financial-services company created by the merger of Citibank 
and Traveler's Group, which needed portions of the bill to allow certain 
parts of the merger to go forward immediately. Other financial-services 
groups said the measure was needed to make U.S. financial firms more 
globally competitive. ``For the proponents of this bill, this is extremely 
discouraging,'' Martin Farmer, a lobbyist for the Independent Bankers 
Association, said. ``The prospects for its passage right now are gloomy.'' 
Under the maneuver orchestrated by Lott, if Gramm drops his opposition, 
the two ``poison pill'' amendments, one eliminating the ``marriage 
penalty'' on federal taxes and the other to allow for school vouchers, 
would be lifted and a Senate vote on the bill could proceed. There 
has been some talk the bill could possibly be attached as a rider 
to an omnibus spending bill now before the Senate. But to accomplish 
that, the approval of the Treasury Department would be needed and 
that has not been forthcoming. The Treasury Department has objected 
to portions of the bill that expand the Federal Reserve Board as the 
top banking regulator at the expense of the Treasury. Paradoxically, 
Gramm's opposition over the expansion of community reinvestment obligations 
provided a victory for consumer groups, which have the exact opposite 
point of view. These consumer groups had opposed the measure because 
they felt it did not go far enough in broadening the reinvestment 
rules. On Friday they welcomed the demise of the bill. Bankers say 
they will bring up this measure again next year. ``If this bill were 
on the House or Senate floor, it would have passed by a huge majority,'' 
said Edward Yingling, the chief lobbyist for the American Bankers 
Association. ``That makes it likely it will pass next year.''
