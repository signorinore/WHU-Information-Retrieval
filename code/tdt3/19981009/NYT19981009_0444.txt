This Sunday, on the 23rd anniversary of her marriage to Bill Clinton, 
Hillary Rodham Clinton will be in Bulgaria, making a visit that morning 
to the Faith, Hope and Love Center, a shelter for homeless children 
in Sofia. The Clintons planned to celebrate their anniversary privately 
Friday night, aides said. Clinton bought a gift for Mrs. Clinton on 
a trip to Philadelphia last Friday, and on Friday Mrs. Clinton brought 
home takeout ribs, steak and tacos from the president's favorite restaurants 
in Little Rock, Ark. Joseph Lockhart, the White House press secretary, 
said Mrs. Clinton's trip was planned ``months ago.'' The president 
is planning to spend the weekend here, working the telephone, monitoring 
the budget negotiations, and reading, aides said. ``He has a lot of 
foreign policy reading he wants to do,'' one aide said. On Saturday 
morning, the president will deliver his weekly radio address live, 
and it will probably be about the deadlocked budget talks. White House 
officials said they were reluctant to inquire into the Clintons' anniversary 
plans, saying that after an agonizing year, the Clintons deserved 
some privacy. Clinton has said he has been trying to repair damage 
done his family by his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a former White 
House intern. This will be the first anniversary that the Clintons 
have been apart since moving into the White House. A year ago, Clinton 
spent six hours on their anniversary in the Oval Office complex, in 
part to prepare for a trip to Latin America. ``Her Calvinism will 
let me work, but no golf,'' Clinton joked with reporters as he walked 
back from the West Wing to the White House residence. That day, Ms. 
Lewinsky met with Clinton in the small study off the Oval Office for 
nearly an hour, to discuss efforts to find her a job in New York, 
according to her testimony before the grand jury here. The meeting 
was disclosed in the report to Congress by the independent counsel 
Kenneth Starr. Ms. Lewinsky has testified that her sexual relationship 
with Clinton ended months earlier. Mrs. Clinton plans to depart on 
Saturday for a trip that will take her to the Czech Republic as well 
as Bulgaria. In Sofia, she will attend a conference titled ``Women 
in the 21st Century,'' part of a project to encourage sustainable 
development in Southeastern Europe. In Prague, she will attend another 
conference, this one called ``Forum 2000,'' to discuss globalization 
and the next millennium. She is scheduled to return from Prague on 
Tuesday afternoon. The Clintons were married on Oct. 11, 1975, in 
a simple ceremony in their home in Fayetteville, Ark. They spent their 
honeymoon in Acapulco, Mexico, with Mrs. Clinton's parents and brothers.
