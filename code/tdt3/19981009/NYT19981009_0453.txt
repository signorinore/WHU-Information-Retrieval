Long-Term Capital, the troubled hedge fund, has suffered losses of 
$200 million to $300 million in the two weeks since it was salvaged 
by a Wall Street consortium, a person involved with the fund said 
Friday. Such losses would amount to 3 percent to 5 percent of the 
$3.6 billion rescue package arranged by 14 banks and brokerage firms, 
which acquired 90 percent of the fund in return. The partnership is 
now known as Long-Term Capital Portfolio LP. As of Wednesday evening, 
the fund had about $1.7 billion in cash and about $1.3 billion in 
Treasury securities, this person said. In addition, the fund has recently 
increased the backing it has put up for some of its securities trades 
and has repaid a $500 million bank loan from Chase Manhattan Corp. 
The fund, based in Greenwich, Conn., was established in 1993 by John 
Meriwether, a former vice chairman and bond trader at Salomon Brothers, 
and a group of his Salomon colleagues. It suffered huge losses this 
summer on large speculative positions in world bond markets. The speculation 
was done with tens of billions of dollars of borrowed money. As Long-Term's 
capital started to dwindle rapidly, its leading banks and brokerage 
firms gathered at hastily arranged meetings at the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York to fashion a rescue that was completed on Sept. 28. 
Long-Term Capital Management, the fund's management company, continues 
to run the fund with oversight from the group that rescued it. Since 
that rescue, the fund has been the subject of continual rumors on 
Wall Street, where financiers have become increasingly jittery over 
the gyrations in financial markets and the big losses reported by 
many banks and brokerage firms. Partly because of such rumors, the 
group of financial firms that recapitalized Long-Term Capital, through 
Oversight Partner I LLC, a venture set up for that purpose, issued 
a statement Friday restating its intention to have Long-Term remain 
a going concern. It also said that it would concentrate on reducing 
the risks of the huge Long-Term investment portfolio. ``Since the 
closing on Sept. 28, nothing has occurred that materially changes 
our goals and objectives for LTC and our view of the sufficiency of 
the capital infusion,'' said Richard Torrenzano, a spokesman for Oversight 
Partner. ``Speculation about current LTC capital and liquidity levels 
is inaccurate, as both are significantly higher than the numbers appearing 
in recent media reports. The original positive net asset value level 
has not changed materially since the closing on September 28.'' The 
participants in Oversight Partner are Bankers Trust; Barclays Bank; 
Chase Manhattan; Credit Suisse First Boston; Deutsche Bank; Goldman, 
Sachs; Lehman Brothers Holdings; Merrill Lynch; J.P. Morgan; Morgan 
Stanley Dean Witter; Paribas; Societe Generale; Travelers Group and 
UBS. New reports about Long-Term Capital continue to trickle out. 
The fund had 30 to 40 trading strategies in place, according to an 
internal document, dated December 1996, from UBS, the huge Swiss bank. 
The document was cited Friday in a report by the Reuters news agency. 
The fund, this report said, had eight strategic investors, mostly 
government-owned banks in major financial markets. As of December 
1996, these strategic investors owned almost 31 percent of the fund. 
Their participation, according to the report cited by Reuters, gave 
Long-Term ``a window to see the structural changes occurring in these 
markets to which the strategic investors belong.''
