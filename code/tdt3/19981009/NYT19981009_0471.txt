The war of words between the Whitewater independent counsel and the 
White House escalated again Friday when Kenneth Starr accused one 
of President Clinton's lawyers of deceiving the Supreme Court and 
wrongly accusing prosecutors of misconduct. On Monday, Clinton filed 
a brief in the Supreme Court implying that Starr misled a federal 
appeals court in June. The brief noted that Starr had argued that 
impeachment was too remote an issue for the judges to consider in 
deciding whether Bruce Lindsey, a deputy White House counsel, could 
refuse to answer certain questions because they were protected by 
the lawyer-client privilege. Three days after making that argument, 
Starr secretly filed a motion with a different court asking for permission 
to make an impeachment referral to Congress. In response, Starr issued 
a statement Friday evening that declared that Neil Eggleston, Clinton's 
top lawyer on privilege issues, ``has deceived the Supreme Court and 
the public by falsely accusing this office of misconduct.'' ``Mr. 
Eggleston is misrepresenting the facts,'' Starr said. ``In the oral 
argument, the independent counsel said that because no Articles of 
Impeachment were pending, it was `premature' for the court to decide 
whether attorney-client privilege applies to government attorneys 
in impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives.'' Starr 
also said he had noted in his argument to the appeals court that the 
independent counsel's office had an obligation by law to report evidence 
of impeachable offenses to Congress. Eggleston replied Friday night 
that Starr's statement had failed to address the issues raised in 
the White House's brief, namely that Starr's office was busily preparing 
an impeachment referral while telling the court that consideration 
of possible impeachment was ``premature.'' ``Mr. Starr plainly conveyed 
to the Court of Appeals that the White House's argument that the independent 
counsel was improperly acting as a stalking horse for Congress in 
the impeachment process was too remote and speculative for the court 
to consider,'' Eggleston said. ``In fact, only three days after that 
argument, he informed the special division of his intent to submit 
a report to Congress recommending the impeachment of the president.''
