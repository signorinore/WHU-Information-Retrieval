Skirting antitrust concerns that derailed its attempt to acquire a 
competing drug wholesaler in July, Cardinal Health Inc. announced 
Friday that it would buy Allegiance Corp., a hospital supply company, 
for $4.5 billion in stock and assume $890 million of its debt. Allegiance 
makes surgical instruments, rubber gloves and other operating room 
supplies. Cardinal already gets half of its $16.5 billion in annual 
revenues from hospitals. Robert Walter, chairman of Cardinal, which 
is based in Dublin, Ohio, said the acquisition would generate $50 
million from added revenues and cost savings within two years. Joseph 
Damico, president of Allegiance, said the payoff would come through 
sales growth, not by shrinking their combined 2,500-member sales force. 
He said Allegiance's account managers would promote Cardinal products, 
but Cardinal representatives would still make their own sales. Allegiance 
is an offspring of American Hospital Supply Co., which Baxter Healthcare 
Corp. acquired in 1985. ``It's a terrific merger,'' said Ronald Nordmann, 
a partner at Deerfield Management, a New York-based health care money 
management firm. ``It makes Cardinal a one-stop shop.'' The fortunes 
of drug wholesalers like Cardinal and McKesson Corp. rise and fall 
with the pharmaceutical industry, and ``the drug companies are in 
the best shape they have ever been in,'' said Leonard Yaffe, a health 
care analyst in San Francisco with NationsBanc Montgomery Securities. 
Hospitals, for their part, are under cost-cutting pressures from managed 
care and government payers. But Damico said that demand for medical-surgical 
products was rising with the aging of the population. Allegiance sales 
were $4.4 billion in the year ending June 30. Another plus: Both companies 
have little exposure to overseas economic or currency problems, Nordmann 
said. Under the deal, each share of Allegiance stock would be exchanged 
for .415 share of Cardinal stock. Based on Thursday's closing price 
of Cardinal on the New York Stock Exchange, the transaction was valued 
at $38.47 a share, a 67 percent premium on the Allegiance share price. 
Friday, Cardinal dropped $8.8125, or 9.5 percent, to $83.875, and 
Allegiance gained $9.4375, or 22.5 percent, to close at $32.4375, 
also on the Big Board. Some analysts said it was a rich price for 
Allegiance, which is in a commodity business with annual sales growth 
of only 2 percent to 4 percent. They said the company received a significant 
portion of its $107 million in net income last year from a slide in 
the value of the Malaysian ringgit currency. Allegiance makes medical 
gloves in Malaysia. The deal was a rebound for Cardinal, which dropped 
its $2.4 billion bid for Bergen Brunswig Corp., also a big drug wholesaler, 
after a federal judge ruled in July that the deal raised antitrust 
problems. McKesson's attempt to buy AmeriSource Health Corp. also 
foundered on Federal Trade Commission objections. Cardinal then bought 
R.P. Scherer Corp., which makes gelatin drug capsules and other drug 
delivery products, for $2.2 billion in stock and assumed debt. ``It 
became clear when the FTC blocked the mergers of the pharmacy distributors 
that the second-best option would be to buy a hospital supplier,'' 
said Vivian Wohl, a senior research analyst at Merrill Lynch. She 
said McKesson, which bought General Medical Inc., a hospital supplier, 
last year, recently jolted competitors by winning the drug and supplies 
business of the big Columbia/HCA Healthcare hospital chain. Credit 
Suisse First Boston advised Allegiance on the deal. Morgan Stanley 
Dean Witter and the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup Inc. advised 
Cardinal.
