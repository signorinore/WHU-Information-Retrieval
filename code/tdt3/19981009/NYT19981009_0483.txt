The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 10: In the 
blue distance life goes on as usual, though the foreground swells 
with scenes of excruciating woe and mild acceptance. The postures 
are stylized, but the faces are uniquely individual. The weight of 
the sacred world is balanced, sometimes toppled, by the weight of 
the secular world, by the sight of gardens and city markets, peasants 
and hunters, seen through the windows of a room where an angel interrupts 
a handmaiden sitting in a plain but exquisitely detailed interior. 
These images come from the Metropolitan Museum's remarkable exhibition 
of early Netherlandish painting, ``From Van Eyck to Bruegel,'' on 
view through Jan. 3. The exhibition spans the period from 1430 to 
1565, beginning with Jan van Eyck's paired paintings of ``the Crucifixion'' 
and ``the Last Judgment'' and ending with Pieter Bruegel the Elder's 
wholly secular work called ``The Harvesters,'' two extremes within 
the continuum of 15th- and 16th-century Netherlandish painting. The 
surface of the earth, in Van Eyck's ``Last Judgment,'' has been cracked 
open like an egg, giving way to a scene of torment among the damned. 
The chaos is echoed by the crowd that gathers, in the companion painting, 
at the scene of the Crucifixion. The view is deep _ the moon rises 
behind mountains that seem miles beyond the focal hilltop _ but the 
foreground has been tipped forward and down, giving the viewer an 
intoxicating visual command. We look beyond the natural horizon, out 
upon a world in which past and present mingle, united by the clarity 
of Van Eyck's eye. In Bruegel's ``The Harvesters'' there is the same 
heightened command of naturalistic detail, the same ability to capture 
the roundness with which the world and its objects appear to us. Yet 
in Bruegel the earth has none of the fragility it has in Van Eyck's 
``Last Judgment.'' It is not a shell concealing the torment of lost 
souls. The earth beneath Bruegel's fields of wheat, beneath the eating 
and sleeping workers, has a truly planetary mass. The scene spills 
outward to an economic landscape where, for the moment, thoughts of 
another world have been set aside in the heat of the day and in the 
haste of harvest, a landscape still contiguous, no matter what has 
changed, with our own.
