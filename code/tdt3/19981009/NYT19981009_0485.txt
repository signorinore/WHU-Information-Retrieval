The New York Times will say in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 10: 
The number of people abusing the bankruptcy law to stiff their creditors 
is probably not very large, but the fact that there are some who do 
it brings the law into disrepute. Just this week, the actor Burt Reynolds 
had his bankruptcy plan approved. Creditors will lose millions, but 
Reynolds will remain a millionaire, as did Bowie Kuhn, the former 
baseball commissioner, some years ago. This page has been sympathetic 
to changing the law to prevent such abuses. But the bill pushed by 
Republicans and passed by the House is a parody of reform. It cracks 
down on credit card debtors with inflexible new rules that could force 
many to keep paying the card companies even if they cannot afford 
to do so. But it does next to nothing about the loophole used by Messrs. 
Kuhn and Reynolds. The method they used was to own an expensive house 
in Florida, a state that lets a bankrupt person keep a home _ no matter 
how palatial the house or how vast the acreage. The Senate bill would 
have made it impossible for states to let a bankrupt person keep more 
than $100,000 equity in a home. The House, however, wanted no such 
restrictions, in part because of lobbying by Republicans from Florida 
and Texas, which also has a generous bankruptcy law. The conference 
committee _ in a decision that was made by Republicans without any 
involvement by Democratic members of the committee _ threw out the 
Senate provision and instead simply said that states could let a bankrupt 
person retain any house owned for at least two years prior to filing. 
A fair bill would attack the real abuses, while giving judges flexibility 
to consider the circumstances of debtors. This bill does neither. 
If it reaches his desk, President Clinton should veto it.
