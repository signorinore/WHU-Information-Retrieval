The judge who presided over nine months of often contentious testimony 
in the Tawana Brawley slander suit issued his final decision in the 
case Friday, ruling that Miss Brawley herself, the central, elusive 
character in this drawn-out melodrama, must pay $185,000 in damages 
for defaming Steven Pagones. The judge, S. Barrett Hickman of state 
Supreme Court, said in a harshly worded decision that Miss Brawley 
could well have been fined much more because she was the person most 
responsible for falsely accusing Pagones of rape and because she had 
``literally thumbed her nose'' at the court by refusing to testify 
about the accusations she first made 11 years ago. But based on his 
sense that she was a woman ``caught up in her own fiction'' who might 
have been manipulated by her family and her advisers _ the Rev. Al 
Sharpton, C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox _ the judge said he had 
decided to temper the fine. The three advisers, who repeatedly accused 
Pagones of assaulting Miss Brawley, have already been found liable 
for $345,000 in damages, with Mason assigned the largest share: $185,000. 
Miss Brawley was fined separately because she had been found in default 
years ago for failing to appear at an earlier phase of the case. It 
is unclear when _ or if _ Pagones will see the money he has been awarded. 
Maddox and Sharpton have already appealed the judgments, and Mason's 
lawyer filed an appeal on Friday. Maddox, who had positioned himself 
as Miss Brawley's closest adviser, said late Friday afternoon that 
he had not spoken to her about the judge's decision, but that he believed 
she would never be forced to pay. In 1987, Miss Brawley, a black teen-ager 
living in Wappingers Falls, N.Y., said she had been abducted and raped 
over four days by a gang of white men, some of them law enforcement 
officers, who afterward smeared her with dog feces and dumped her 
in a garbage bag. Miss Brawley, who was 15 at the time, later accused 
Pagones of being one of her attackers. But an extensive grand jury 
investigation found that Miss Brawley had not been raped or attacked 
and that she might have created her condition herself. In his decision, 
which he issued from his chambers here in Putnam County, Hickman observed, 
``It is probable that in the history of this state, never has a teen-ager 
turned the prosecutorial and judicial systems literally upside down 
with such false claims.'' Hickman said he was appalled that Miss Brawley 
had agreed to attend a rally in Brooklyn last December to repeat her 
charges, but would not come to the defamation trial in Poughkeepsie 
to testify under oath. Noting that just this summer she had received 
an award in Brooklyn and continued to claim that a crime had been 
committed, Hickman wrote, ``It is indeed a sad day when one receives 
an award for seeking to perpetuate lies and falsehoods.'' Pagones, 
who is now contemplating job offers after spending the last year in 
court, said the judge's decision was morally satisfying _ if monetarily 
thin. ``I'm very pleased with the message that the judge conveyed,'' 
he said. ``It was long overdue.'' But, he added, ``I was hoping the 
punitive damages would be a little higher.'' Pagones pledged that 
he would see to it that Miss Brawley and her advisers were forced 
to pay the judgments against them. ``I don't know if it'll be $5 a 
week, but I'm going to pursue that judgment,'' he said. ``There's 
going to be consequences for the damage that they did.'' But as they 
had throughout most of the civil case, Miss Brawley's former advisers 
scoffed at Pagones' concept of victory and at Hickman's sense of law. 
Sharpton appeared, if anything, to be buoyed by the judge's assertion 
that Miss Brawley had been the one most responsible for the false 
charges. ``That just strengthens our appeal _ because we said we believed 
Tawana Brawley,'' Sharpton said.
