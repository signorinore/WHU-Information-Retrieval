One minute before 8 p.m. on Thursday, 9-year-old Melissa Morgan was 
sitting on the floor of a Wal-Mart in Brick, N.J., crowded together 
with 200 other keyed-up children, waiting to scramble for balloons 
with prizes inside. Two minutes later, she was sprawled on her face 
as adults trampled on her and the other youngsters, desperately grabbing 
for balloons. Like the dozens of other children hurt, she emerged 
scratched and bruised, but without serious injuries. ``People were 
going crazy,'' Melissa said. ``I was squished and thrown down. Somebody 
stepped on my foot, and I couldn't get up. It was like being in a 
movie _ a really bad movie. It was really scary; there was blood all 
over the floor.'' The event was supposed to promote the store's toy 
department and raise money for the Children's Specialized Hospital 
in nearby Mountainside. About 300 adults and children were charged 
$2 each to take part. Children ages 3 to 12 were directed to a small, 
roped-off area of floor near the front of the store, said Jason Shepherd, 
a Brick police officer. Parents and teen-agers surrounded the area. 
Tarpaulins holding the 500 balloons _ each with a slip of paper redeemable 
for a prize _ were suspended above the crowd of children. At the signal, 
children were supposed to pop balloons with their hands. The prizes 
were discounts on toys, gift certificates and a two-minute buying 
spree in the toy department. As the balloons fell, ``older children, 
then parents, were pushing to get to them,'' said Lt. Douglas Kinney 
of the Brick Police Department. ``It touched off a little stampede 
kind of thing.'' But it was over quickly, said Shepherd. When he arrived, 
10 minutes after the kickoff signal, he said the melee had ended. 
Parents were trying to comfort sobbing children, or hauling them out 
of the store, or snapping at employees. Forty children with scratches, 
bruises and minor head injuries were treated and released at local 
hospitals, said Joni Schultz, a spokeswoman for the Medical Center 
of Ocean County. First-aid workers who set up medical stations at 
the Wal-Mart treated dozens more children who were kicked, clawed 
and trampled. One 3-year-old girl was briefly knocked unconscious. 
She was released from Brick Hospital after a CAT scan showed that 
she was not injured, Ms. Schultz said. Starla Weiss, who took four 
children, said that ``parents were in there popping balloons,'' and 
children were shoved into ``one big pile.'' ``Mothers were screaming 
`My son! My daughter!''' she said, as they hunted for their children. 
One ``heroic'' woman, she said, ``was literally pulling children out, 
one by one, picking them up'' and leading them to safety. Mrs. Weiss' 
3-year-old son, Dylan, ``had claw marks on his shoulders and arms,'' 
she said. His brother Zachary, 5, was scratched and sobbing because 
he did not win a prize. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. issued a statement Friday 
saying that it regretted the injuries and was grateful none were serious. 
Store managers said they would try to contact all the customers who 
left their names with store employees. Cheryl Morgan, Melissa's mother, 
said a manager called and offered her toy coupons. Wal-Mart has also 
offered to refund the $2 admission fee. But Friday afternoon, most 
customers wanted the money to go to the children's hospital, said 
Joseph Herron, the manager of the Wal-Mart. At least one Brick child 
had a fine time despite the incident. Danielle Luttenberger, 10, won 
the grand prize: the 2-minute shopping spree. But when she and her 
mother arrived at the store Friday morning, they were told of a change. 
She was given one shopping cart and allowed to take as long as she 
pleased to fill it. ``Under the circumstances,'' said an employee 
who spoke on the condition of anonymity, ``we thought it would be 
better not to force her to rush.''
