The Manhattan district attorney on Friday broadened his investigation 
into possible corruption in the municipal labor unions, demanding 
financial documents from 40 locals of District Council 37, the umbrella 
group that represents 120,000 city workers. With the latest move, 
the district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, has now subpoenaed records 
from all 56 locals of District Council 37 as part of a broad investigation 
into allegations of kickbacks, embezzlement and election fraud. Officials 
who have seen some of the new subpoenas said that they were part of 
an inquiry into possible kickbacks and that they demanded documents 
about the locals' dealings with a caterer, a bakery, several travel 
agencies and other businesses. An official at the parent union of 
District 37, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal 
Employees, said union leaders had been told to expect indictments 
of officials at several union locals in the next few months. Officials 
who have seen Friday's subpoenas said they also sought information 
about the union locals' purchase of thousands of turkeys that were 
given to union members for Christmas dinners. Officials at several 
union locals said their predecessors had paid $44 for each turkey 
when similar turkeys normally sell for half that at retail. Stanley 
Hill, executive director of District Council 37, said: ``D.C. 37 is 
cooperating fully and completely. The locals are doing the same. There 
appears to be nothing new in what is being requested. This is just 
an expansion to other locals.'' Hill acknowledged that the district 
attorney's office previously subpoenaed District Council 37 itself 
to examine its books. Mark Rosenthal, the new president of a local 
representing 2,400 city drivers, said he had provided the district 
attorney with information about large payments that his predecessor 
had made to Gee Whiz, a caterer near the district council's headquarters 
in lower Manhattan. After Rosenthal was elected in July, he discovered 
a series of canceled checks left in his desk that his predecessors 
had written to Gee Whiz. Those checks, he said, were for four union 
meetings held in April, May and June 1995 and were for $12,390, $10,000, 
$11,050 and $12,000. Rosenthal said that fewer than 50 people attended 
several of the meetings. The backs of the canceled checks show that 
they were endorsed and deposited not by Gee Whiz but by various entities, 
including a food company, a seafood company and a meat company. A 
man who answered the phone at Gee Whiz and gave his name as Peter 
Peterson acknowledged that several locals had contracted for food 
from his company. ``They spent it with us,'' said Peterson, who said 
he was the manager. He denied that any money was kicked back to union 
officials. The investigation has been a major embarrassment to District 
Council 37 and Hill, a close ally of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and widely 
considered one of the city's most powerful labor leaders. Morgenthau's 
latest move comes after a union judicial panel expelled Charles Hughes, 
the longtime president of the local representing 22,000 school cafeteria 
aides and crossing guards. The panel found that he had illegally received 
$1.7 million from the union, including $685,000 in fraudulent overtime 
expenses and $329,000 to pay his family's credit card bills. In addition, 
Rosenthal has brought to the district attorney's attention a $81,990 
payment that his predecessor made to a travel agent in Suffolk County 
for a 1993 Christmas party held at Leonard's of Great Neck, N.Y. And 
members of the local representing City University workers have asked 
Hill to investigate how $192,000 disappeared from their union's treasury. 
Hill said the union was seeking to function normally despite the mushrooming 
investigation. ``We continue to take care of the business of this 
council, providing services, making sure our members are protected, 
that they get their salary increases and benefits,'' he said. ``We 
are confident that at the end of the day this council will be standing 
as strong as it has ever been.''
