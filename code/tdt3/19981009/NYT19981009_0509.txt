The Rev. Donald Moore and his brethren gather nightly for meals in 
the dining room of the West Side Jesuit Community. Under the steady 
gaze of icons depicting saints and martyrs, they also share camaraderie 
and conversation about the ups and downs of their days as professors, 
counselors, chaplains and writers. The routine has endured for 29 
years with bonds as intense as any family's. ``We are striving for 
what the Jesuits term a union of minds and hearts,'' said Moore, who 
teaches theology at Fordham University. ``We are striving to be, quote, 
friends in the Lord, unquote. And we're succeeding.'' They've had 
less success being friends with their landlord. Since Oct. 1, the 
23 Jesuits who live in 16 rent-stabilized apartments at 220 West 98th 
Street have essentially been squatters. Their landlord will not renew 
their leases and has told them to move or face eviction, even though 
some of them have been there since the early 1970s. Why? The leases 
are in the name of the New York Province of the Society of Jesus, 
the religious order's local governing body, whose address the landlord 
listed as Fordham University. The landlord's lawyer concluded that 
because the West Side apartments were not the Province's primary residence, 
the leases were no longer valid. Talk about a Jesuitical distinction. 
``I want him to tell me where we really live,'' said the Rev. Daniel 
Berrigan, the poet-priest and pacifist who has lived in the building 
for 23 years. ``It seems to me the quality of human life, and our 
efforts on behalf of people, is being subjugated to this lust for 
money. To him, we're just an integer at the end of a dollar sign. 
He can get more money than we're offering. It's just ripping people 
apart to get the bucks rolling.'' The Jesuits, who originally housed 
seminarians and teachers in the building, now pay a lump sum of about 
$15,000 a month for the apartments, which range from studios to three-bedrooms. 
They said they arrived in the building as a welcome presence, moving 
into apartments that had gone vacant while the neighborhood declined 
and crime went up. They considered themselves a stabilizing force. 
Now, young professionals with children and exotic dogs share the elevator 
with them. ``We arrived as desirables in an undesirable neighborhood,'' 
said the Rev. Jack McSherry. ``We have evolved into being undesirables 
in a very desirable neighborhood.'' A decade ago, the landlord tried 
unsuccessfully to end the Jesuits' tenancy by claiming that they were 
a monastery. Lawrence Furtzaig, the landlord's lawyer, said eviction 
proceedings would soon begin. He cited a 1994 ruling by the appellate 
division of state supreme court that allowed a landlord to terminate 
leases that Lenox Hill Hospital had on 15 apartments for employees. 
The decision held that the apartments were not being occupied by the 
primary tenant, the hospital. Allowing the hospital to renew the leases 
could have resulted in the hospital's depriving the owner of his property 
rights. ``A lease of this sort would be a perpetual undertaking if 
it was protected under the rent stabilization law,'' Furtzaig said. 
Legalities aside, you have to wonder if the landlord knows what kind 
of tangle lies ahead. In the name of social justice, some of these 
Jesuits will break the law before they break into a sweat. Father 
Berrigan, 77, once burned draft files with homemade napalm. The Rev. 
John Dear recently spent a year in jail with Berrigan's brother Philip 
after attacking an F-15 bomber with a hammer to protest militarism. 
True to form, Berrigan has enlisted Ramsey Clark, the former United 
States attorney general, to help with their case. (They also have 
a tenant-rights lawyer leading the charge.) They have invited the 
landlord to a communal dinner to put, as they said, a human face on 
the adversaries. The landlord declined, but they still include him 
in their prayers. They want to preserve their community because it 
sustains them in their individual work. And while they might consider 
moving _ as a group _ they don't know where else they can find enough 
apartments at the right price and place. ``Going through this can 
only be to our advantage,'' Berrigan said. ``We're getting a taste 
of what poor people face all the time. It's good for us. Though it's 
not easy.'' Maybe, he said, it is time to move or be moved. How about 
protest? ``You have any ideas?'' he asked. ``You know what Phil and 
others have done. They go to the homes of judges who have done them 
ill and raise a fuss. That'll be our last resort. We won't say whose 
home.''
