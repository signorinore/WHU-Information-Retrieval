It's Friday, October 9. I'm Tony Kahn in Boston. Today, U.S. envoy 
presses Slobodan Milosevic to pull his troops out of Kosovo or face 
NATO airstrikes. But a man who knows the Serbian leader well, has 
little regard for him. He's a man that can't be reached by goodwill. 
He can't be reached by reason. He is perfectly prepared to see thousands 
of people killed in the interests of his own policies. Also, an Israeli 
hawk becomes foreign minister and the album "Red Hot in Lisbon" becomes 
hard to find. First, this news.
