From National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm Frank Stacio. The 
House today approved a temporary spending bill aimed at keeping the 
government going over the weekend. The chairman of the House Appropriations 
Committee, Republican Bob Livingston said, there is not going to be 
a shutdown. Meanwhile, negotiations between the White House and Congress 
continue in an effort to reach agreement on a permanent spending plan 
for the new fiscal year.
