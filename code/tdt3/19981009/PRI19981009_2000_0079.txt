The House gave its overwhelming approval today to a measure designed 
to make it tougher for people to declare bankruptcy. The bill faces 
an uncertain future as NPR's Brian Naylor reports. Some 1.4 million 
Americans filed for personal bankruptcy last year, a figure that's 
up more than 300 percent since 1980. The banking and credit card industries 
have been pushing all year for a tightening of laws they say make 
it too easy for consumers to walk away from their debts. The Senate 
and House each passed different bills, the Senate's slightly more 
forgiving for low to middle-income debtors. But in a House-Senate 
conference with input only from Republicans, the more lenient Senate 
provisions were dropped. These included allowing debtors to keep their 
homes, worth up to $100,000. The White House says the revised bankruptcy 
bill favors credit card companies at the expense of families. Senate 
Democratic leader Tom Daschle says the bill will be vetoed, adding 
he wanted bankruptcy reform but found the Republican drafted measure 
deeply disturbing. Brian Naylor, NPR News, the Capital.
