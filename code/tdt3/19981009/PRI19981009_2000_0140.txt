Senator John Glenn of Ohio wrapped up a week of training at the Kennedy 
Space Center in Florida today. He and his six astronaut crew mates 
spent the morning strapped in aboard the space shuttle Discovery. 
Pat Duggans of member station WMFE reports. John Glenn and his crew 
mates have close to 2000 switches, buttons and dials to keep track 
of inside the shuttle's cockpit. The launch pad count down test gives 
the crew a chance to flip, turn and push all the controls they will 
use on launch day. Glenn says the physical training hasn't changed 
much from when he became the first American in orbit in 1962. NASA 
fortunately let people get their own methods of how they want to keep 
physically in good shape. As long as you can pass a physical, flight 
physical, why that's all they care about. Glenn's critics wonder aloud 
if he's training hard enough or whether he should be on the shuttle 
at all. The former astronaut says his detractors should look at his 
list of experiments. Lift off is set for October 29th. For NPR News, 
I'm Pat Duggans in Orlando.
