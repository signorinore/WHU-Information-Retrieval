American envoy Richard Holbrooke has ended a day of talks with Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic on the province of Kosovo. Holbrooke 
characterized his discussions in Belgrade as serious and pledged that 
negotiations would continue. Holbrooke was trying to persuade Milosevic 
to avert threatened NATO airstrikes by obeying a six point ultimatum 
from the big power contact group. In Brussels meanwhile, a NATO activation 
order is expected within days authorizing the use of force.
