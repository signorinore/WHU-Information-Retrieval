Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today named ultra-nationalist 
Ariel Sharon as foreign minister. The appointment comes as violence 
again flared in the Palestinian territories and just six days ahead 
of a summit designed to revive the Palestinian-Israeli peace process. 
Netanyahu said Sharon who fiercely opposes the Oslo peace accords, 
will be a member of the Israeli delegation at the U.S. sponsored summit 
near Washington. Sharon has strongly opposed the U.S. peace plan because 
it would require Israel to transfer another 13 percent of the West 
Bank to Palestinian rule.
