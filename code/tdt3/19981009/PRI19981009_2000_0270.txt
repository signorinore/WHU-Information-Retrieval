A federal grand jury has indicted Russell Weston, Jr., on six counts 
in the shooting deaths of two policemen at the U.S. Capital on July 
24th. NPR's Chitra Ragavan reports. Weston was charged with two counts 
of murder, one count of attempted murder and three counts of using 
a firearm. According to the Justice Department, Weston has a long 
history of mental illness. He himself was injured in the shootings 
and has had extensive surgery. Weston's first court appearance was 
on September 23, to answer one federal murder charge for the deaths 
of the two police officers. He could not walk and was in a wheelchair. 
He did not enter a plea and his mental condition did not come up. 
Weston is currently under guard at D.C. General Hospital. He's a long-diagnosed 
paranoid-schizophrenic. He often wrote to various government agencies 
about land mines on his property and other perceived threats. Weston 
will be arraigned Wednesday. Chitra Ragavan, NPR News, Washington.
